CSSD does not know either Voldemort or the bakery in Prague.
The newly elected CSSD members in the capital city will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argument that was born in the last years at the mayor, when it was the partners of the current coalition that led in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the newly elected people don’t understand the well-known terms.
At least they say.
“Who is Valdemort?”
“I really don’t know.”
"I'm a young man in Prague's politics reacted to Lukas Kaucky, the elected to culture at the test of the "parent" vocabulary.
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina responded in the same way.
For example, the meaning of “golf hole”.
"This is the only expression among those you propose to me that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use it.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial has chosen 6 examples, primarily those that are linked to the mayority of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the greatest golf hole in Prague", going to the patissery, "the beef's nerve", "the capital's betrayal" and "entolering".
Three of the elected were agreeing for the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who must lead the education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not take the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek rejected the test.
“I don’t care at all about these things here and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I’m not going to give my opinion.”
“I’m currently concerned about how we’re going to understand ourselves within the framework of our programs,” he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that it is about the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s the White Tunnel,” says Kaucky and immediately adds, “but I know it from the newspapers.”
“I’m going to have to pay for a language lesson,” he laughed.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy,elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks the meaning of "going to the bakery".
“It’s, I think, going to a company,” Plachy is ready to guess that it’s the headquarters of Janousek’s companies.
In the same tone Brezina reminds that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates to the tests there is no argument lexic in social democracy.
“I’ve taken advice with colleagues and it seems that we really don’t have something like that.”
“We’re rather saying the names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me like that,” Karel Brezina said.
The newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention to him before the elections by the fraud during the party's sponsoring, is called "the little toy".
The surname is also the only one that admits employing within the party the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn’t like much to hear Hulda, but the Akutel.cz newspaper recorded another surname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in Matrac Law" reminds it appears that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctorate in law JUDr. at the Police Academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to decrease the torture of the "sorciers," a brochure was published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, can’t work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "socker" is isolated in order not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man has very rarely that fate.”
“We don’t even judge young women healthy because they participate in work and give birth to children,” a sister who takes care in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society said.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit the hunt to witches.
The case contains a “hic”.
“More than 70 percent of Burkina Faso’s adults don’t know how to read,” the newspaper Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witch is common in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso’s neighbor, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman has died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprinkled her.
It was the BBC’s server who gave this information.
The criminals claim that it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves for ritual onctions has burned in the contact of the woman.
The oil appeared to flame when the team wanted to “hunt the bad mind” of the woman.
The isolation of the "sorciers" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human mind eats have always represented a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunting, Gambia has not later than last year even seen the President himself participate in it.
“Gambia’s President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt for witches who, apparently, would have participated in his death and would have been struck by the black magic to kill the president too.”
“Rescue chamanes from nearby Guinea have brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the presidential personal guard, men and women randomly chosen to dance villages in Gambia,” Amnesty International said in a message.
In the farm prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The rental of Bakal: The pools heat, he signed a higher rental.
An impressive old man is out of the door of the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his, his daughter, and his son who is getting a punishment.
The de-regulation has increased the lease to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there's no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the signature power.
“But I have signed anyway,” he explains, motivated with anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz which has described the new rental conditions as "immoral and inappropriate", advises rentalers not to sign and wait until December 7, date on which a notice will be published to explain the method to follow to claim.
But man reacts to this by a hand gesture.
“The one says this, the other says something else,” he tightened his eyes.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what the majority of the apartments in the Czech Republic whose rental does not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has, for this reason, decided to visit the “laboratory” personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Just next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "lease 2011", is lighted on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don’t have time to read your number “157” that your number already begins to shine on the big screen below the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it’s your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple comes to find out about the rental, but the new rental doesn’t seem to affect people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems as everywhere – requests for repairs, insurance events and more.
In the Ostrava region, people in more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments have picked up the mail with the new lease contracts in their mailbox since around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rental increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special box for new loans is open to the public since November 18.
"It has been working for a week, so it's still at the test," the employee, after a moment of hesitation, replies when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and ancient minors apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
Deputy President of the Parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats this in a fairly sustained way before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
“20 years after them, I want a new floor.”
“They didn’t even change me a put...n of board in the toilets, it relieves in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a refund on the new rental price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a refund of half of the amount of the rental will be received by the other renters who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" shell of the Havirovaska street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
“From the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent,” the employee said.
And yet RPG stands both on its website as well as in individual interviews on rental when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rental, it is an independent court that will make the decision.
“It’s not about threats but just informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
“There’s no one going to the court,” said one of the RPG Byty employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center gave him right.
“I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5000 to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
“We will see.”
“Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks no one to sign and so people wait,” she says.
The rental regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic need.
"And, in addition, the current leases still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the fund for housing," reminds Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is just the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the rider angry is the main reason for the rise of the lease.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with leases to invest in the apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging on the ceiling in front of the overwhelmed chairs of the Havirosvka Street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The rental increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
“And it will always be at a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month,” the screen says.
The increase of 38 percent concerns only 400 RPG portfolio apartments.
“In these cases there is an increase of a really very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2,” adds RPG.
The next year the rental will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rental increase (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rental increase have the priority.
The primary school is part of, it also, offices have understood architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he also houses a mini-school with everything needed - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can visit it.
The architectural-project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined its mini business school since the first stairs of the Avriopoint building.
She employs approximately 90 people, mostly from the age of making children and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, primary school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Constructors and architects therefore have the opportunity to unite a work taking care of children.
It is the employees of Arch.Design.they themselves who imagined this school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a dotation from the European Union and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
The mini school is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Human Resources Program and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding subsidies (at a height of 2.8 million Czech crowns).They were able to buy equipment and equipment and after two years to provide qualified staff as well as the launch.
After the use of the funding grant (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to make the mini school work on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is the Economy rating company that helped make the grant application.
Child care is provided by a qualified staff, the whole day a nurse and a maternal teacher take care of children. children can go to maternal school without age limit but they have more than three anspour most.
As it is a "mini school" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but over the day there are more who are replaced.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking at the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the mini-school program is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not only play, but a quality teaching is also guaranteed - from the beginning to the preparation to the school banks, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and don’t have the stress of a delay to go picking the children in a school far from the parents’ workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural loyalty relationship is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among the companies that offer a choice bonus for recruitment of new employees and who are family-friendly and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house is still fascinating after 100 years. take a look at Gaudi's interiors.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric savarian, the staircase to a dinosaur's spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic shapes, the house received from the locals the surname of House in bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of squares and mosaic, facade reminding of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is epic for Antoni Gaudi's New Art.
The front facade of the house plays its dream lines, its pleasant colors and texture that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and order thought with accuracy.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lighted in such a way that the brightness of the colors is strengthened.
The rolling and turning of the shapes also appears in the interior with the same measurement.
The wood copies into waves the windows frame, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelid and the lamels.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample neighborhood in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was done for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of another completely new but quickly accepted Gaudi’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-housing house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is just on his project that the decorations for a representative apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals called the house hot just after its completion because of its organic shapes "the house in bones".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of St. George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time,with typical airing events and chemins.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of that time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction it was obtained from the city the permission to build, knowing, of course, that the data drawn on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrifying and requested changes.
For example, the members of the municipal council did not like that the pillars of the construction stumbled on the public trottoir.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) the permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a room and a private part of the apartment.
The floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high company can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction, in addition to new facades, received a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
The game of Gaudi with the light is also impressive, blue and white glass plates with which the interior courtyard is decorated and with the bricks of light.
The two-colored game gives the maximum light in every floor of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun’s rays.
The Casa Battlo house which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous creator's birth.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a profitable business and they expanded the field of visits to common spaces and ground floor including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really not expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist cards holders have a 20% discount.
The amount is still above the entrance price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you need to quickly find a companion among the inhabitants of the building and fully visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a sumer: women have different criteria than men.
There is no ostentatory frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so the mattress and sumer give a real basis for a good bed.
They must, of course, complement themselves harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are determining,:weight, size, age, health status as well as the owner’s gender.
The type of interior in which the mattress and sumer will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the countryside where you don’t sleep continuously the latex mattresses are not suitable because they “heat” gently.
They also have a greater weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be returned frequently.
If they also have not enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid plate, they retain humidity.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Whoever spends the clear time abroad where we often use very thick mattresses with a sliding layer, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“This is how all the hockey players who come back from NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
“For their tired shoulders, legs and shores, they needed mattresses with a stunning layer of slurry.”
“These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that thus undertakes badly the “information” of the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in packed furniture.
That’s why a few years ago the mattress with lazy mouse conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
“Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have appropriate mattresses.
You don’t need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a lazy spider.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing presses you and you won’t go back in the night as after a hard match.
You just sleep better.
The slurry slurry also works as a protection against scars.
To choose the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
So a man and a woman of a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example, single beds, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient when visiting.
"But there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you're lying on the back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded coats. Helena Prokopova, Chairman of the Association of Brewery-matelassiers and decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and to the ergonomy of the furniture and teach it in specialized schools.
For a two-seat bed each needs its own sumer and mattress, so be careful however during the purchase to properly choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to climb the sumer at different heights and this is not possible on all the bed frame.
The mouse mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattresses are at least 15 cm, of which count for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
“When you’re touching or sitting on the mattress you don’t have to feel the resorts,” Héléna Prokopova warns.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of sumer.
The bed-summer, when the mattress and the bed-summer are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses went very bad; it should not be washed, which is usually done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to remind a big (and stuck) tamis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to claim a 25-year lifetime for a mattress or a lifetime guarantee.
All of his but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the mattress coating, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to make coatings with sliding closure for the whole, that is, after the opening we have two parts (for the washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the big models (and for a single person) becomes when you remove them a fight between a lightweight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid plate in your bed instead of a sumer?
Never to!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night.
However, equip the plate (if there are no) with airing holes and use the mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag resorts (Taschenfederken Germany) and a airing layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a type of bed.
For single-position lamellers with 14/18 lamels, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut) are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattresses with more lamels, 28 and above, where the lamels are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses, it is not necessary to take resorts mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to the fixation of the rigidity of the lamels, you can also install what is called a shoulder.
This is a special bond of the lamels that allows for pressure or even inclination of the lamels so that the sleeper's shoulder "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulder as wide as the back," this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by the mattress manufacturers who for the "man" have begun to use a scattering area on the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the heads.
For the hardest customer there are wings or plates with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure disperses in more points and diminishes the tension.
But, of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad jersey (big and swollen air) on good mattresses and summers, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a very simple gloves: the gloves must support the head and its heights must only reach the shoulders, so that the shoulders muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50x60 cm that Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When lying on the side, the towel must put up the height of the shoulders (with the backbone of the sumer or the rammolled area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first on the basis of palm and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixture.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soya.
“The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made on the basis of natural products,” explains Petr vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress surfaces; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender perfumes.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the bull plant extract so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cooles the body, "colds" the man, the coating "heats" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore heater for weak sex.
The current favourites?
The mattresses are made from cold mouse (this has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of the cold mouse gives polyzon mattresses that know exactly where the head, the bottom of the back and the feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and the sumer is not easy.
From time to time, in the framework of special actions by manufacturers or producers, two mattresses can be made for the price of one.
As for example, the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory shell coated on the coating for 11990 crowns.
The second one can be taken for free.
The age of lazy or viscoelastic mushrooms with an open cell structure and a large thickness has begun with the Tempur matter at a "cosmic" pace.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts suffered the launch of huge load factors.
The Tempur falls into the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It perfectly adapts to the warm human body and gives it optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic mushrooms are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot coats that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their children leads more and more people to think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as by exmple that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a lightbox but will soon be the size of a clock.
The case of the little Anicka excited a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to trouble their privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that it’s not spying but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin from the company MAcro Weil who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
“I admit that there may be cases of poor use of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is unknown, but I have not yet met such cases.”
“Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes the "box" is used and how to use it in emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws the attention that if the child does not want to carry on him something of this kind, he will get rid of it.
“And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut off like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very controversial.
“If it’s a prepared rape, the author will do everything to ensure the child has no electronic device that can locate it.”
“Today it’s the phone.”
“As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will search for them as the sale will be supported by a advertising campaign.”
“In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
She still acknowledges that such devices can help in an unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in case of an aggression.
"The device can be set up in such a way that it is in regular emission after a certain period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slept and is in a laying position without moving,” Cech says.
According to him, so-called smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formated it with a special prologue.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those we carry in pendentif of the size of a lightbox or to the smallest telephone devices.
You can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital clocks.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Of he will realize it after a certain time, which will give the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or a pendentif, it will always use the same technology as for tracking cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using the GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a cell phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many explosive cords that it could turn around the Czech Republic with. but it can only last two years.
The army purchased for 445 km of cords used for the explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense purchased 224 km.
The military has a reserve for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifetime of the cord is from two to four years maximum.
The army purchased explosive cords from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The Major General gave MF DNES as a reason for the purchase of an enormous amount of explosive cord that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reservation calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES has contacted, it turns out that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive exercise each year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defense and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to argue the military’s annual consumption of 60 km of explosive cord.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army reserves could subsidize it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough for more than 2 m of explosive cord, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has provided - also with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the Quick Intervention Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their poing weapons and that the shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
There is no talk about the lack of body washing.
"And I don't take my head if they buy at us such a large amount of explosive bears."
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us the army is a good customer that we as traders strive to satisfy,” says STV Group’s commercial director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of explosive cords by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reports only four years of life of the detonating cord and the police and army pyrotechnicians only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the deposits, it can go even up to four years," said the two who don't want his name to be published given the criticism of the army.
The last lifetime, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the soldier's life.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of cordeal detonants.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s supply of 245 km,” said spokesman Pejsek, who is the interpreter of the minister’s buyers’ opinion.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cordes of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet Army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for safety reasons for the pyrotechnicians and in addition to being able to get more flexibly the more modern and reliable types of detonating cord.
The Defence Ministry today has major problems with the neutralization of tens of tons of munitions from the Warsaw Pact time when the powerful two hundred thousand Checoslovak army was preparing to move, towards the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of kilometers of old explosive cords that it is now buying "eashly".
So far, I am taking advantage of the contacts I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition for the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the award for the best individual Entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved traveling.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
Of his savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 half-destroyed apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in the thirteenth year of graduation, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between the quality and the price of a accommodation in our region gave me the desire to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first renovated apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profits in the building he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year there was another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have manifested," the number 1 entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory at the competition of the entrepreneur of the year served well, adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me in the streets, they congratulated me often and, I have to say, it was very pleasant,” he reminds.
He recommends participation in this contest to anyone who strives to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses to date his contacts and knowledge that he’t have been able to obtain in any other way.
“With those I met through the competition I started to maintain commercial relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation associated with success also affected employees.
And there are about 70.
"I observe at home above all the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
“This is not, and far from, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of us all together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rapidly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to seek the prize at Slovansky dum for the first place in the competition for the Company of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he transformed a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
“I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but also my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight against competition,” the winner of the competition said.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as a compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he didn't hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and founded a company with a few companions in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
It has become after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have begun to really better know the brand Farmet but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they were working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not passed in Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company’s assessment was made on the basis of the 2008 and partly 2009 economic results.
And just in 2009 it was the hardest year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which didn’t really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new equipment and technology.
“Of course we have not escaped from this situation.”
“The sales have fallen by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even dismiss,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time impopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly andined profitable results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
“We built with the dotations a training and research center, we strengthened the company’s presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions,” says Zdarsky.
Everything leads us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is increasing and the number of employees is also increasing.
“A new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a quiet atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes foolish regulations.
The Survey on the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been removed.
The little glorious winner of this year’s Survey on the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring to the offices the documents that officials can get online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, the Social Affairs Administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the official can get it in two mouse clicks.
This changes through the investigation.
“The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment checks,” said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters protested, at least 4,000 this year brought their votes.
And it’s not surprising, there’s in our country the most diverse legal obligations that make it just hinder the company, and,this, more and more.
“We may be at the number of documents to fill in for tax statements at the top places in the world,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of conditions for the company, which is 8 more places than last year.
The Competition of the Absurdity of the Year was launched for the first time in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the closure of the contest.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and let the public vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity who received the greatest number of votes is declared winner.
Until last year’s last survey, it was a hundred, or more accurately 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also the trade unions and teachers.
Among the “finalists” of the competition, therefore among the nominated is, for example, the obligation that highways and highways maintenance vehicles pay the fees, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repair two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the contest, which starts at the beginning of November on the Venceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which regularly participate personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culminating moment of the competition.
“Economic prosperity can’t work when the state puts stones in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that reason my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today make the company only complicated,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to eliminate absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what didn’t like people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or a peeling with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee for 30 days, was removed with the text of the Law on what is called the Green Card.
And everything is OK until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a big mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by decree of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or even sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year’s Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the 2010 Responsible Firm.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair company.
“We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their company on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity,” says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the company’s competition of the year 2010, organized by the company Vodaphone, entered the companies that did not succeed with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article should be edited.
Although the object of their business is different from each other, their support and prediction activity can be considered the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, this concerns persons with disabilities and their employees’ personal or health problems.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is no example the Prague prologues company Et Netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo which has been the main contributor to the grant fund that sponsors disabled children for 17 years.
The Old Paper Manufacturing Factory in Podebrad employs more than 70 per cent of it, which, for this, obtained the title of Responsible for the Central Bohemian Region and was the third in the region at the competition of the Company of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing ease working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours a week in average and, that, without, proportionally, reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded the title because it gives priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a long-term activity in the nearby area and takes care of the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration have the least impact on the environment,” says Miluse Ryznarova, CEO of the company.
The responsible company IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set them up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The Man in the Shadow that helps the local Rom community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of the society.
In the last place is, also for its activities, a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonus above standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the Moravia-Silesian region.
They were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, who had answered the questionnaire in attachment to the document for registration and had returned it to the organizer before 15 August.
The wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the contest by the organizer.
“If the representatives of the firms in league had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the ‘main’ competition the Vodaphone’s Firme of the Year.”
“Independent registrations are not possible because it’s a subcategory of the company’s main competition of the year,” says Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Fund for the Land in Plzen, the police carried out arrests during a public contest
In the Plzen Land Fund building, the anti-corruption police have carried out arrests in recent days.
Detectives passed the handbags to the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos.
It had strived to manipulate just a public tender for the settlement of a return application in such a way that the proposed field is obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. a half million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for initiate crime as part of an offer call and a public contest," said for the Pravo newspaper Plzen Prosecutor's Head Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
Police have released this 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, we can only speculate given so little official information.
At a Pravo question, the spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually carried out an arrest in Plzen on a separate workplace and, thus, during the public contest.
“It was a client and in no case an employee,” she said.
The public contest according to Cerna has as true name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Law on Earth" and is set up when several law recipients demonstrate.
“These persons offer, as part of the appeal, a greater value of their rights to resituations that must be settled before the value of the field is announced.”
"According to the proposed rights a classification of the buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the spokesman explained.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information about the persons who had been registered for the appeal and as he himself is also a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of remuneration rights, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he probably paid for withdrawal.
That would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpellation.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrins).
He appeared in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for having edited land for which the decision to set up a construction was already edited.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land destined to the construction of public communications, specifically in the place and place where the artery of access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far higher.
The municipality was forced to accept because otherwise it could put the construction in danger by a blockage of the land.
The households will pay a supplement of a hundred crowns per month for the housing.
From January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all kinds of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and some places rental will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw from their wallet up to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a dozen more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to approximately 100 crowns per year for households in apartment than it is currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
There can also be a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that are planning to raise prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, Libérec families will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 percent is prepared for water and sanitation in the event that the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rental does not change the pragois will pay an additional fee of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are rising by 7.4 percent.
The rental prices will increase, for example, significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new rental increase will be translated before the courts by the company.
Regular rental that people pay in 300 thousand apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and in an exceptional way the best whisky brand are stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the doctor's hands.
Children who are treated in the hospital for recurrence do not make the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to hospitals’ children’s departments’ admission.
“Beers and wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk.”
“The trend is really to strong alcohols,” Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children’s Department of the Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, says.
“When they get a bottle to dad in the closet, it’s sometimes wisky but it’s fernet and vodka that prevails.”
“The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don’t feel it,” the head of the department explains.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, also gives her right.
“It’s usually rum or fernet.”
“Today, alcohol is fashionable, especially in elementary schools.”
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the head of the department of Pelikan, seeing drunk children aged from thirteen to fourteen years at hospitalization is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he exercised just ten years in pediatrics where the ambulance carried schoolchildren from the widespread surroundings completely drunk.
A young woman was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with a mixture with extasy," the doctor described this important case.
“She was in the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party.”
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," said the head of the department surprised.
It is precisely the parents’ disinterest or their unusual tolerance to the fact that their rejection adds to the drink which is the main cause of the development of children’s alcoholism.
According to the specialists, however, we don’t talk about dependency, in its strict sense, for children.
“Under the alcoholic vocabulary we hear a chronic alcohol addiction of several years with all the phenomena that arise from it but that we don’t find in children.”
"For those who use the repeated acool, this is rather a socio-family background significantly disadvantaged," explained the head of the department Pelikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the Pediatric Clinic in Motol.
They are integrated into the statistics only cases with a grape poisoning that requires hospitalization.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, it exits three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, St. Sylvester and the end of the school year.
“Of they drink despite bad results or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of vacation.”
“Naturally, I’ve lived on the Wizard’s Day a admission of seven drunk children at one time,” said Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in detox under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who has returned home and suffers the next day of the "tree wreck".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are eliminated by a glucose and nutrient infusion that the body needs.
"They are better looted because they spend a great evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurt them."
“They’re just surprised where they’re,” says Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it ruins the patient’s good mood at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go to tens of thousands of crowns.
“Over time, I applied this as a means of education by counting these children how much their drunk cost and they could spend the whole summer on seasonal work to pay back a single evening,” added Pelikan.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their recession management, which should recover from parents the care-related charges, do not deal with the cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are first in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defense exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, landed on Tuesday to Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is sitting.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the biplace versions of the L-159T1 which were so far in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining Lestrois devices are the monoplace versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationing at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary – the company Omnipol – took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defense’s press department, the physical departure of Vodochody’s aircraft is for the moment unknown.
"The L-159 monoplaces planned for the exchange were taken on aircraft stored for a long time without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defense."
“The L-159 T1 biplaces were exchanged in the state,” said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without biplace as the ministry signed in May 2009 with Air Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 monoplaces into two biplaces.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second is scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS has committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some of the Alliance countries.
“In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will serve to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account to determine how to this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was confirmed last year by Mirek Topomanek's government.
The Ministry of Defense has not launched a tender and has directly contacted EADS.
The defense leadership then argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought at Air Vodochody 72 aircraft and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will likely have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defense to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft had to be selected as part of an European tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the latter is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the annular are exposed to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before the age of 60,” said Ros Eeles, co-author of the study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should submit to the prostate cancer test, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health backgrounds.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, the same probability of a prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular risk, however, fell to 33 percent, for men before the age of 60 the risk decrease reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is just testosterone that helps to develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that he doesn’t seem, it seems, that the relationship between finger length and cancer is “fullly demonstrated”.
The Czech Republic is under snow, the highways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and trottoirs, there is most of the time of compact snow, scrapers have worked the whole night in many places.
The D5 highway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometers towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 to Brno to Prague is suffering the same fate.
The Central Automobile Club (UAMK) spokesman told the news
At the 91st kilometre a truck crashed, at the 93st two heavy weights hit each other, the accident caused people injured.
Several cars were also found in the gap.
The problems are also on the D1 highway to the 185th kilometre in direction of Prague.
Two trucks were hit.
The drivers should go out right after Brno at the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter the 182th kilometre in Kyvalka.
A number of kilometers of cars were formed in this place.
Also on the D11 highway there was an accident and, this, just at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimeters thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created, for example, in Prosek, the Sterboholska street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways take delay, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place de la Paix (Namesti Miru).
At eight a.m. the majority of the crisis in Prague is still meeting.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast connections due to the snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday at 11:00 p.m. in the night until 5 p.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rotating but doubling vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impraticable, on the Brno road it begins to be there by places of snow rafts and on the Blansko road the channels are mandatory to pass certain communication roads in the places placed above.
The region of Vyskov was one of the most affected places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, you may need to send snowflakes and snowflakes.
Unfortunately, it cannot be estimated at the moment when they will be rotating.
On the Hodonin road the prudence is strict in the White Carpathies region.
On the roads that are, given nature protection,ined only by the aspersion of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowfall gradually disappeared in the Czech Republic.
The US has a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. Army has sent to Afghanistan a new “intelligent” weapon, known only as the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic gun will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will “change the game” to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precision canon.
Its projectiles are directed by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm calibre developed for this gun and containing a highly broken explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at the contact of the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
Therefore, it can be used against an enemy that is hidden behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
It is not also protected from the top and when a deadly rain falls on it of steel shells, it can put it out of fight as well.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon that uses the “intelligent” technology.
“The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser radius that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise target point, according to which he corrects his target site and pushes on the relaxation.
“Let’s say you’ve targeted 543 meters.”
“When you press the relaxation, the weapon is charged and shot at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters,” Audette said.
400 jobs displaced
Fujitsu Group is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace, which is currently located in the office building of the Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located on the Marienbader Square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on the Lyoner Straße street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to incorporate 100 more jobs still spread in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the employees' way of work.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just rental.
Director-General, Bernd Wagner, said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a primary location with remarkable infrastructure.”
He affirms that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region has raised the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been thus conquered.
It is a “extraordinary profession of faith relating to the place of implantation.”
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its implementation is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The management has informed the municipality of this intention very early.
“It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company,” Mr. Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relationships could not have changed anything to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer facing the owner of the building of the Place Marienbader.
The economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now about avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
“I hope that the owner and renter of the building will be cooperative.”
Ten years ago, the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville building, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighboring “little vertical” company, as well as the rest of the Marienbad Square buildings, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance of the city was created between the station and the city hotel. This caused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that once served in part parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment counseling company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt Group Specialized Real Estate-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group with its headquarters in Tokyo is considered the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to and also provides the essential service.
Its branch located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu has much more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year old complex, whose name reminds its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrical Industry.
Amazon's Server Expulsion - Threats to Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is experiencing more and more difficulty.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressures that have been undergoing after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently resides in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks site is attacked with more and more force.
The cyber-activist group “Wikileaks” no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is being sought by Interpol, is likely to stay in Britain, according to news published by newspapers.
“Wikileaks is excluded from the Amazon server.”
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said on Wednesday (local time) cyber activists who originated the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Earlier, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: “Forgiously, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
The television channel CNN, quoted Liebermann's office, that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The Chairman of the Senate Commission for Territory Protection threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, the British newspaper, The Guardian,.
"I would have wanted Amazon to take this measure earlier given the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," Senator said.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
“Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and scrupulously, and thus puts our national security in danger and lives in danger all over the world,” the Senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether it is American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disclose the content of the stolen documents.”
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is searched by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people searched by Interpol.
According to the information broadcast by the London newspaper The Independant, the 39-year-old Australian man lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has constantly described the lawsuits against him by Sweden as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats were made against the site.
“There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange.”
That’s why Assange is afraid of his security, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the Wikileaks-made disclosure man be prosecuted and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, Prime Minister's adviser Stephen Harper told television, obviously ironically, that Assange should be "morted" and that Obama could "use a drone".
In the meantime, a dispute was triggered between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, called "ridical and absurd" the fact that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to the diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in spying activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual owner of a website," Gibbs says.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the statements of a website.”
The U.S. government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Fight, was appointed responsible for fighting the escapes.
Travers is responsible for implementing “necessary structural reforms” made indispensable after the disclosure of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the desire to check the means through which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
“We are ready to protect them if it is necessary.”
The University of Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice confisers are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers had a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
The ice and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat demoded ice confiser, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice manufacturing art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window with the help of a spatula, puts it in the oven and then starts selling it.
To know this, you don’t need to go to Anzola dell’Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cannot avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbeter manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that the ice creams out of its machines meet everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers has had a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extend over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are organized in the private glacier.
In full quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk to realize their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer in the future a quality European product to the country of industrial ice.
Anke de Berlin is a business management advisor and she wants, after a few years, to get some unique thing from this stressful profession.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is determining not only the good taste, but also the smooth flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano wheat the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer that heats all to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program and then cooles immediately to four degrees.
He then opens a robinet installed on the machine: he releases a pasteurized base white cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately attacked by the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact that he is allowed to be inducted into mistake by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may have, despite this, used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, from gar seed flour obtained from gar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only you need to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will not crush anything but ice granules.
Some modifications of the basic mass are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with the aroma.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or dessert range of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
“The suppliers will all try to repain you with dozens of aromatized ingredients.”
“But you just have to try.”
Or in the fruits sorbets recipes with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or in ice cream made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and, when added cacao powder, constitutes the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must pass to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four types of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and noise with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pures: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Nuts ice does not necessarily contain the taste of nuts, when it consists in large part of nuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of a ice,” says Luciano.
Ice manufacturing is a calculation exercise: if you use fishing purée with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruits (the vineyards use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grain mouth).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The production of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as before.
It’s not only the basic automatic mass manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also a device in which you simultaneously beat the available ice mixture to make it onctuous and returned to negative temperatures.
Despite all automation, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbs himself with fruit purée from head to foot and thus craps his colleagues when the control of the colossal bul mixer escapes him.
The master Luciano is of the opinion that “a similar incident risks to occur during each course: it’s just a matter of time.”
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiences the cultivation of genetically modified plants has found the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institut for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed,” said M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech in Munich on Wednesday.
Some information reports that the chairman of the EFSA expert group for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other EFSA experts are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has collaborated decisively in the elaboration of the EFSA test prescriptions for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms formulated by Mr. Then.
The prepared prescriptions correspond textually, by paragraphs, to the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and thus carry the brand of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities located in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking officer of the EFSA recently joined the Swiss agro-food group Syngenta without a condition or without a transition period.
Recently, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the EU authority responsible for the control and the industrial lobby, which raised the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and European MPs.
However, the EFSA does not admit that there is no conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data is exploited, including industry data, as long as they are of good professional quality.
It is not prohibited for experts working on behalf of the EFSA to establish contacts with this business sector.
They should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization considers itself a neutral forum gathering experts belonging, among others, to the fields of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any food testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
“We want to know what are, for example, the incidences of genetically modified corn cause to the field,” says Mr. Then.
The current practice consists in testing only the isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow to obtain reliable results.
“If we don’t look for the risks, how can we then discover them?” asked Mr. Then in an accusing tone.
This is also the point of view of Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been conducting research since 1994 in the field of genetics and currently works at the Polytechnic School of Zurich.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are hardly yet researchers who are not connected to societies.
According to companies, critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says that “the industry controls security research.”
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell gained about 400 pounds.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart station with her tube on the back.
There was a manif.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands of people protested against the project S21, the transformation of the Stuttgart central station into a underground station that will cost several billion dollars.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the stop of construction works.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk of Crailsheim, a gentle and grassy paved badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
There were a few fragments.
“These stones are relics.”
“They should not disappear.”
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting it to the shell, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He does not know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to a former French army ammunition warehouse in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is doing the trade of old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were broken down or if they disappear in the discharge," he said in his office located in a hutte, which was once a guard.
He says he was subject to insults and threats when in September the newspapers that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project later took one of the parallelépides of stone weighing an average of 80 kilos with a value between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a reminder in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
Nearly half is still stuck in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Gardens owners, landscape gardens, private gardens.
They came from everywhere and took everything they could enter the box and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or in the limitations of the herb-band plates.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” says Mr. Rongen.
“There was no political component.”
He enters his car all ground, turning around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did the law studies he abandoned. later, he began to study biology before later interested in computer science and eventually become a carrier.
An amateur of stones.
It stocks 40,000 tons.
He gathers treasures all over Germany.
He says he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He is freezing.
Sand stones sculpted with art are placed on the snow.
They were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
“My favorite stone.”
He takes the way that runs through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Red sand stone, previously part of the Karlsruhe station.
and so on.
“Beautiful travertine.”
The parallel epiped was once part of the tribune of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the red granite from the St. Blasien Cathedral, the tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were sculpted by hand and moved with the help of simple palans and chariots drawn by cows, he becomes quite respectful.
“It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put into ruin.”
He has not become rich, even less rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass breather and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
He is expected to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to be saved.
Talent struggle to conquer the high potential
The building has a strong affluence.
16 students go on to buy small salmon bread, tomato sauce, and white manger.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer have invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea competition, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the company Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to body-to-body in the competition to uncover better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multi-form cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most skilled graduates as much as possible in the amphitheaters before these arrive on the employment market and are courtsed by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, they try to identify exceptional talents as part of practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automobile group adored the talents.
A young woman from the staff service shares the stylos, sweets and cards containing the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional stages and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group’s premises.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, look closer to serious candidates and appreciate those who come into account as a collaborator.”
According to Mr. Sees, such cooperation is unusual.
What’s new is the offensive with which we are trying to attract students.
“Old time, the emphasis was placed rather on the professional project,” says Mr Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harder.
In the property of the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by carrying out a trial on a kyriel of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and, above all, courtising the highly qualified workforce.
These are mainly Graduates from the engineering sectors who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German Engineers Association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unemployed in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, the vacancy regarding engineering positions will increase further.
Roman Dykta goes on talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, audit, accounting and consultancy.
It organizes expensive talents recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a type of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will thus send eight promising students next year so that they will travel the U.S. in this way.
Participants can occasionally visit KPMG’s subsidiaries and know the company.
The person to participate will decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the search for high potential in universities are increasingly important.
“We want to get out of the lot through the cruise race.”
“For us, a simple cruise was too little.”
For the talent hunter who is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
“From today, we have remained in contact with all the people who took part in a similar action last year.”
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon," he said.
In addition to the direct training carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a very classic way by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
“We are trying to reach graduates by participating in professional salons.”
“For example, at the Solar Technology Show,” says Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, the manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs approximately 1,500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stübe is aware of the problem related to the relief.
Currently, 35 jobs are put to the competition on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to get vacancies.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university professors.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with different higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the possibility to carry out professional stages or to write his final study project at us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced by solar specialists.
That’s why the company tries to make its advertising by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Sometimes a large group can’t do that,” says Mrs. Stübe, head of staff.
It has long been that money has no longer played the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good opportunities for promotion are the other key factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld is ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute constitutes an annual honorary table for German employers.
For this purpose, it asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the employees’ framework conditions.
The head of staff Mrs. Stübe hopes that this placement will increase the image of the company among job seekers.
“I think the candidates are primarily dedicated to external assessments regarding a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
“The best way for a employer to become attractive is to pass through his own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the industry, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer’s brand image within his own staff.
“The satisfied employees are the best messengers.”
When one treats their employees well and they identify with the company, they do their own employer advertising to their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil burns
There will be no new oil burns in the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Florida, the south-eastern state of the United States, over the coming years.
The Washington government has issued an equivalent prohibition and thus permanently canceled its initial plans.
Even on the Atlantic coast, new forging remains prohibited for now.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the "Deepwater Horizon" forging platform that is the source of this strict ban. This must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of the accident that cost the lives of eleven employees and leads to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, subject to pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, said he was willing to allow the realization of new forages in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution thus want to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who carries the responsibility for the devastating black wave in the golf is not, so far, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with billions of compensation demands, is at the center of the accusations.
A Commission of Investigation established by Obama is expected to present its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, had lifted the frozen burning decreed after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and stricter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which discredited after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing profound reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced it would remove the tax niches profitable gas and oil groups.
Actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the energy flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to the results of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit cabinet, before the burning ban issued on Wednesday.
In addition, the American Enery Alliance regrets the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulations."
Investments agreed in new support projects were postponed to a new order, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry.
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oil; it releases a smell similar to the one that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
People live from theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t get exhausted,” the environmental activist throws to journalists to calm them: “You still have enough oil blade today before the water lens.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man drowned in the wet water up to his chest, as well as the fat trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the shade of water in the color of the cloud arc.
It cannot be noticed that the underground is full of brown nappes of crude oil.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that, once, she was gathering whole seals here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters were completely silent.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil came out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the enormous landscape.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo now have to rame for six hours to reach the fishing waters: the Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole extent of the destruction jumps in the eyes when you walk through the mangrove mares passed through water streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat breaks a crading brown water. Anyone who puts his hand in it will remove it with any oil cover.
The small roots of the mangrove emerge from the ground like stains. The isolated palms sadly leave their palms hanging.
The bird clouds are searched in vain, as they are usually found in humid areas: As the off-board engine stops, a fantomatic silence falls over this former paradise that resembles a service station by the smell it releases.
“What’s happening here is war against the environment,” says Celestine Akpobari with a sad sound: “Our lives are characterized by a permanent danger in terms of health.”
The comparison of wars is done.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield occupied for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because these had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the country of Ogoni is prohibited to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 bricks and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipes throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the country of Ogoni are inexploited, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every a few hundred meters rise in the water of steel trees as well as bizarre sculptures: It is very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees" the heads of burning holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rooted by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari estimates that a burning head of this nature breaks from time to time, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been wasted on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that that was wasted into the sea during the accident of the super-petrolier "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago on the outskirts of Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphonage of the oil pipes are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists on their part consider the explosions of the burning heads and perforated oil pipes as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell Group of applying in Nigeria essentially less strict safety standards than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of conductive failures is “more much higher than the ones.”
Some shapes emerge from mangroves to a place that, seen from far, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of camouflies and installed outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with camouflies to the neck.
A shining fire under one of the many tunes that sometimes connected to the tubes, sometimes spread without reason on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, says Michael, team chief.
At first, the gas enters a container by passing through pipes, then at the end of the conduction the crop cerozen falls and you eventually get the diesel.
That’s how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre Diesel futs daily: “This brings us 34,000 Naira,” about $22.
The inhabitants of the Delta take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than that ridiculously low of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they buy their raw materials for free.
This is offered by the “protectors” that put the oil pipeline network in the whole country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil throughout the entire Delta of Niger.
Only a small part of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally purified: the organized crime networks that also count among its members high-ranking politicians and soldiers, charge the lion’s share in tankers and brade it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether environmental disaster or rather subversive activities should be attributed to the population or to the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intrusions and the foundations of the fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage, nor theft and illegal refineries.”
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni’s relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only a matter of the group’s withdrawal. ”Maybe operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will be better.”
Michael became nervous.
“It’s time for you to go off,” the robust oil worker announces.
“The soldiers can appear at any time.”
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be the subject of an arrest, but at the maximum they will offer them pot-de-vin.
Even the soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
"At any point of view, this fit truc has caused our country to fall very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators find construction defects in the A380 reactors
The A380 is evidently suffering from a major safety problem.
By examining a plane that carried out an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to “the reactor’s catastrophic failure.”
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
Earlier in November, airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had visibly had so far more chance: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian air security authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft had a serious security problem, and it warns of a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cells and leaks at the oil pipeline connectivity level, according to a statement published Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a “catastrophic failure of the reactors.”
These are the Rolls-Royce reactors that are equipped with 20 A380 aircraft.
The airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land emergency on 4 November in Singapore, is among those.
The Australian airline has now launched lawsuits against the British reactor manufacturer.
She has filed a lawsuit to an Australian federal court with headquarters in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would claim damages in relation to the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were removed and the carrier surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the cause of damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now have to be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that additional security tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with questions reactors.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered sufficiently important to inform all stakeholders.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the airline Quantas had immobilized all its A380 fleet on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest line aircraft in the world.
Snowfall all over the country causes chaos in transportation
Germany all covered with white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos runs on all roads, trains and aircraft are immobilized.
At least three people were killed in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany flourish: by ice temperatures, almost the whole republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many locations.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the Winter Service staff worked permanently, but they couldn’t come to the end of the snow that continued to accumulate.
Furthermore, violent rabbits scattered the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau charged with maritime navigation and hydrography (DSH) expects that sea rays will take place over the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can reach 1.2 m above the normal.
Snow accumulations on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That’s why the weather warning station Meteomedia announced the violet warning level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it’s the highest level.
In some places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds dispersed.
Many trucks and cars were stuck in the night.
Even in the land of Sax-Anhalt, police have severe disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 highway, snow and wind caused a traffic interruption and caused locks.
In Thuringe, the snowfall hit the A4 and A9 highways.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious rail traffic disturbances have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees falling on railways, chains or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, the interregional transportation between Leipzig and Nuremberg was interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
The firefighters and paramedicals had to supply the 165 passengers with coverings, food and beverages.
Snow winds shut the roads.
Snowfall has led to numerous flight cancellations at the major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights had already been canceled to Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stuck at the airport, but only 400 beds are put at their disposal.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train on an upgrade passage.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here a truck was hit to a upgrade passage because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car crashed on a sliding street in Aschaffenburg.
However, the weather scientists announce a good news: the snow will always be soft and dustful, but it will flourish in case of light racks.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
It is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twins.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located in its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just decorated the group’s headquarters: the twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is obviously seeking to recover the costs of renovations and it is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman has not stated the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, “We’re checking if it’s more interesting to take care of the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to put them in rental again later.”
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already surrendered its seat shortly after.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the Twin Towers for an amount of €272 million from owners of own funds.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization, according to some indications, amounted to approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the towers, re-called "Green towers", to approximately 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently unknown whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people are crying for the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought of the buried miners who were dead after several explosions occurred in a mine.
We had not yet been able to get the bodies back because the security situation of the damaged well continues to be uncertain.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the crashed pot, but no traces of survivors were found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent explosion, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors had no chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be lifted up.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth, south of the New Zealand island.
They watched two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfing panels, also had their place.
The flags were placed in berne in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemorative party that New Zealand has fed the hope that minors will regain to the surface.
“They never came home.”
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the fosses said he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative party.
Minors of South Africa and Britain were also buried during the first November 19 explosion.
The rescue forces began burning a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter a artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre thanks to his film, "Wahlalla Rising", the epope of the fighter.
Which audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he filmed “Walhalla Rising”?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is made prisoner; he releases himself from his burro and, with a almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one by another. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloody action, just because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When he is in bad mood, he removes the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the bourne says no word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at the maximum, around one or two phrases some terrible agony screams.
Otherwise, nothing is said and it is celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which constitutes the decor of the world of the Vikings, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers who are interested in existentialism and for excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it’s a shame that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy relating to the narcotic trafficking harsh and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant news or introduce a little less brutality to the art and test cinema.
Most art cinema fans have to experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
Action film lovers die from tiredness, when the bourne embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship toward Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and cloud before the crew arrives in America and continues to silence.
It is not surprising that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, is hiding behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverious dream transformed into a film.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lugubre soundtrack, but above all with an insatisfactory hatred that rises from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully next to the burn, preserves some innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the bourgeois hero whose mobiles are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, is a messenger of the devil himself.
It represents corruption, but also, only for those who are, in any way, corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated or admired, which has the purpose of disturbance, enthusiasm and surprise.
This is a traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrace work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IEA) has new indications regarding a Syrian nuclear program.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, even less to submit itself to the agency’s controls.
In the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest nearby city is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is listed in the IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built appears with the help of North Korea in a stone parallel epiped, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring town, el-Kibar, would be well capable of producing plutonium, which would allow to produce atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a presentation video containing unclean satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the inside of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have barely more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is deepening more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor in El-Kibar, but there was little evidence that this country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "presumed reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation as "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked about how he’s sure he’s dealing with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer, saying that the IAEA had “a sufficient document to ask questions.”
The Syrians have quickly removed the ruins of the "unused military building" and conducted a methodical placement of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received thanks to a member state satellite images from commercial providers showing the moment that directly followed the attack. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, Israel, has purchased them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it had never implemented a secret atomic program and that it had not built a reactor.
Damascus says the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it unlikely.
Since that time, damas have refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controlers to carry out a second inspection on the site of El-Kibar and refuses access to the ruins of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never make any comments on this."
This is how the investigation on this case has been ongoing since June 2008 without an outcome and that it “most becomes a serious issue of the agency’s credibility,” as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna acknowledges, in the end it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that to progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
Until now, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities are here, or what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also from the names of the neighboring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) in Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would very likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly next to it; that’s exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to the IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
Indeed, it is an intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the stone parallel to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serves to fuel production."
It would have “no indications regarding sensitive activities,” such as enrichment and recycling of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor works thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there are strictly plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to produce the bomb would have been later separated.
It is unclear whether the gravats, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of land charged trucks have disappeared, no one will have information about the place of storage of the gravats.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined in 1998 the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could fit for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing the satellite photographs taken on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite photographs, however, show that Syria has undertaken terrace work in the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these places.
It may be a coincidence, but it didn’t help remove suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic environments that the IAEA spent several months drawing up a plan on the inspections to be carried out there. This plan should allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time spent shows how great the inspectors are interested in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
One year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has mentioned for a few months what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has to carry out its controls.
The IAEA director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already talked about "a option to which I am open to in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there are no desire to see the situation experience an escalation.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "It would serve, if at the end they find nothing."
Love in time of war
Angelina Jolie started as a director in the summer.
She wrote the scenario itself: it’s a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
No more is known about this story, but this is enough to cause discomfort.
An ongoing rumor suggests that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian boyfriend during the Yugoslav War.
The Bosnian women’s federations immediately protested. In response, some scheduled filming sequences in Sarajevo were displaced in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims Organization sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and asked to meet the actress.
A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined that offer.
“The meeting must be held in Bosnia,” Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s scenario tells a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic’s organization later recommended the UN High Commissioner to withdraw the status of goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of script has Jolie written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted after a few doubts a filming authorization in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not come afterwards despite this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by doing a lot of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She claims that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains unclean about the content.
It’s quite different: Lovers knew each other long before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This makes a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with his puppy."
That Jolie’s film had begun long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, is "unfair and based on wrong information."
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the net, like many others before.
Let us shoot!
Everything is going well with the Irish.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overwhelmingly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy on the background of a strong music, they tighten their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in Southern Ireland vibrates because players launch and succeed in dropping table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into the opponent team's beer gobelets.
The winner receives 500 euros plus an airline ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas the world championship of beer-pong.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the computer scientist, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terebrante question, which will start on the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct employment interviews in New Zealand.
“I feel a strange feeling,” he says.
“The home country is so far and I don’t have a job.”
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner’s three sisters tried their chance abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social assistant, resides in Sydney, and her brother Colin now occupies a computer consultant position in London.
The youth goes away: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of the tanner.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research say that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have a great relief, sadness now takes all its place.
The economic crisis, however, affects mostly the well-trained young Irish, who have only experienced moments of happiness so far.
Employment loss and social defeat seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there was money in excess.
Three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes abundantly the letters of readers written by young immigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes on the way."
“There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the possibilities, goes away and our country so a whole generation.”
“The last one to leave is shut down the light.”
Law student Leanne Caulfield, chairman of the Irish Student Union, sees pointing to a darker future because the government is just throwing the powder in the eyes and offers no perspective of the future to young people.
“They are reducing minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old student said.
She sees how her comrades cramp from a practical unpaid stage to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
“It’s a sad and depressive thought.”
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition that offers comprehensive support on the theme "working abroad".
“But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for the new in the profession to take the first steps in the scales of the professional hierarchy,” the man said.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction and Germany sector.
A fashion house comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover and Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his homeland, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to finish paying the credit agreed to build his home in his homeland.
“The situation is already a bit mad,” he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I almost no longer live.”
It broke out of a shy laughter through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-careed front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of €380,000, funded at 100 percent by the credit.
“There were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, feeling hot tea and says: "I don't have children to maintain and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn’t like the complaints he often hear in recent times.
“No one should suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as we’ve ever lived here on the island,” he said.
“Working for a while abroad isn’t what’s worse, maybe that’s what makes us feel first Irish.
He laughed and then talked about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after spending seven years there and, in Ireland, life continued, simply.”
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
Leaving the future and discovering how life goes elsewhere.
In his palmarès, He has already a few years of work in London. That's why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there’s still one thing that’s worried about him in recent days: the party to organize on his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that she can’t turn into a goodbye evening.
“Only, not a lot of emotions,” he says drinking a long cup of beer.
A goodbye, it seems worried.
"Let's rather call it a goodbye evening, all relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, just like that for private enterprises.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements come from the results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the quite sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
The support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, the support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also risen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after having suffered a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which makes the regional average down (see Table 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way their country’s democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase over the 25% in 2001 (Graph 3)
About 34% said they had trust in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but strongly rising compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shocked the support for democracy.
If this kept well during the global financial crisis, it is due to the fact that many countries in America have only suffered a brief recession and have benefited of a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week that the proportion of Latino-Americans living in poverty only increased slightly in 2009 and dropped again this year, to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see graph 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a broadly shared feeling of progress.
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where the violent crimes have worsened.
It’s only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or one of their relatives were victims of a crime during the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (over 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, decreasing by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Dirty Vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the destroyed and drowned country in fear.
Voting boxes and a new election were presented, voting bulletins dispersed in the countryside, scattered voting offices and intimidations.
The voting offices opened late in the evening.
Many Hathians, including many who were displaced after the January earthquake, went to the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up leaving.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several supposed favourites, denounced the fraud and demanded the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the high official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event as "a fairly good election in many ways."
Observators from the United States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they “do not believe that these irregularities, no matter how serious they are, have necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to the unpopular president René Préval and his candidate Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tournament reached the second round.
With a rage cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, we feared that the participation would be.
In the event, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The challenge is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The foot to the center
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, received a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fernández, apparently in sadness, according to which she would abandon or not the intrinsicity of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of elaborating budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the additional income on will.
Mr. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into trouble after Mr. Kirchner died from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power gathered to Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentary fell on one of his counterparts and others accused the government of corruption), Congress has no need to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to dispute,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the president even greater maneuver to spend on will.
The economy is overheating largely: it is likely to grow by 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and syndicate salary claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and cleaned the Indec, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mr. Fernandez moderate these policies now?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by the high global prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation eroded the push to growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Per that’s why Mrs. Fernández shows signs of the desire to restore Argentine’s financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government signed an agreement with the bonders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
Kirchner has always insisted that this could not involve monitoring by the IMF, as it is usual.
But last month, the Minister of Economy, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude of the endurance of the INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs. Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If it does, it needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very promoted.
When the Argentinians will come back from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will reverse.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many policies of her husband.
A half hour for China
Taiwanese voters are oriented towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother located on the other side of the strip?
More than 7.5 million voters presented on November 27, or 70% of the eligible people, to elect the mayor and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for the feelings about the continent, having established innovative business links, including a partial free trade treaty, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
I did the test, but right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five municipalities, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which looked towards Taiwan's complete independence, won 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including tapaging camp truck and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimal dresses.
A mandatory mysterious murder attempt was also committed.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, the KMT’s honorary president, made a election tour for a KMT candidate in the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passenger.
Curiously, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, said the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
The biggest winner of the election was China.
It was stunning to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates joined with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its actual independence and hates the military threat of China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from acting the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, on his part, claimed a confirmation to see if his policy regarding China was acceptable for the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the government of Beijing will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy that aims to cheat Taiwan, back to the backyard.
China has not lost time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see a political integration; but let’s start with the beginning.
It is better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has re-invented itself.
Two years ago, he was bad: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison after corruption accusations.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Mrs. Tsai’s leadership and the PDP is doing everything to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was greeted as a DPP candidate for the presidency, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided their talks may take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a “credible alternative” in relation to Mr. Ma’s hurry approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exhausted by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have obtained better results if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to strike the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
It is necessary to make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma’s assessments were weak; despite a vertiginous economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its impopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the expansion of the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says its office and its local antenna will be renovated.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for the approximation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, “the point of no return has already passed.”
Grammy Awards Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
To perform at the request of a president, and the people are required to get acquainted with it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer gathered by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a large nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist should not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" has made a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, its skillful hand of pop and funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one pointed line in Spalding compared to Norah Jones' fulgurant success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Otherwise, the Grammy Awards voters have fairly honored "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the "instrumental album" category, a turn on a revigorating thrill of a recording that was one of the primordial favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, New Orleans's rack voice favourite and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also strongly tends to a certain merger with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-merited awards in the big group category; in competition with Billy Childs Ensemble’s rich chamber-jazz and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album “Pathways” of his live oct’s was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey Lead in Classical Categories
The classical nominations for the 53th annual Grammy Awards include a mixture of landscapes from musicians and composers from all over the world.
In the top of the nominations, let’s quote “Deus Ex Machina” by Michael Daugherty, for the piano and orchestra, with five “yes”; and “Dreamhouse” by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestra work, with three “yes”.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work which was ordered by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in play for a prize.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year stands for five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati" starring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominations are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "Long Love" of Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Heart of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 took its first in the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he aviat wrote the 15-minute work especially for the Mandoline interpreter Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of range and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director of the orchestra, Pierre Boulez, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who have received a nomination are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only nominated vocalists-solists; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixture category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Cancer: My Life, My Song"
The project of the Temecula mosque wins approval by the planning committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
The critics took the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and trafficking.
But the commissioners decided on Wednesday evening that the new religious center would respect local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many good people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahá’u’lláh, you mention it,” said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
“I am proud of it as a American citizen.”
“It shows that justice triumphs.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They have very strong voices.”
“We have good people in this valley.”
The session began at 18 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people spoke for or against the center, at the time of speech approximately equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no America anymore,” a spokesman wrote.
“It’s another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand.”
“America has fallen.”
Planned Islamic centers also triggered protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, the place of the 2001 September 11 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her 135 family congregation has co-existed without incident in the county of Riverside for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot Mediterranean-style architecture mosque would consist of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still appeal against this project in the municipal council.
A microbe that tolerates arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
“This body has a double capacity.”
“It can be developed either with phosphorus or with arsenic.”
"It's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a really 'strange' form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the Thursday online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We’re wondering what’s still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in the field of life research beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the discovery, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
This was not the case.
The discovery “mosts that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to activate biochemistry and that the “standard” set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed,” commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the replacement of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It was not a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough so that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow gums the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, adjunct professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth’s existence, she says; thus, the researchers issued the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four stolen outside a motel in Bellflower were found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs – two Akitas and two Gales pembroke corgis – disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff department.
“The good news is that dogs are going well,” says Whitmore.
“They are in good form.”
“They were returned to their legitimate owners.”
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
“A investigation is ongoing.”
“We don’t want to say that,” Whitmore said.
“We follow the orders.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They met on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in the county located in Downey.
The sheriff’s assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month female - were healthy and safe, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were taken missing until they were discovered on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in the city this weekend as part of the national AKC/Eukanuba championship in Long Beach, where they intended to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other testing scheduled in the days preceding the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the almost one-month dog exhibition tour of the couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer dog, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaghetti - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with the thicker skin, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little opened the windows so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard the flight of the truck at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could take them to the corgis, equipped with a microwave implanted to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, the MGM restructuring is only waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, officially hired Thursday the plan "pre-packed" by creditors according to which about $5 billion of debt would be deleted; opening the way to the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television shows.
With Thursday's decision, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, no legal obstacle remains before MGM to get back to flood under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be a relieved studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the beginning.
MGM will not really come out of Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility, planned to finance MGM’s new operations and production.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which itself collides at $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was engaged to advise the management on how to put its finances as it had no means to pay the interests of $300 million a year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company in sale.
However, the auction has attracted few tenderers, no one of whom was willing to pay the amount of 2 billion more that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive millions of dollars of rewards for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have collected $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million success premium.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to restart production of MGM, which has released only one film this year, and to set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-financy two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM’s debt, has tried to make a studio merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your budget gifts in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy of this year is the IPAD, followed,, by the Microsoft video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant break in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bicycles at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pear slopes, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget gifts in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toys sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It’s clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) are peluchy toys of the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them on the stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can dance the moon thanks to its innovative articulated legs with wheels blocking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you’re a child of the 80s, you’ll remember Alphia, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to transform a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve board.
If you are doubtful when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
VTech's Mobigo (60 $, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it's the first large review of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old patterns.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90 for 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and is equipped with a SD card entrance that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 $, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a set of five blocks just bigger than a lightbox, each having its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time passes, it’s ideal for an untouched spelling contest.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online puppy from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for the 6 to 12 years old) which includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roulette patins or a puppy toy puppy.
Slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is the latest micro-robot button.
The false beast quickly moves on 12 vibrant silicone paste in random directions.
It’s fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Our resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a Soft Side to Maintain Order in China
Tang Shenbin arpented a place in the city as a urban sergeant to the training by strictly inspecting his nervous charges, issuing a low voice of orders with a military authority.
He wanted the women’s members of Chengguan – imposing officials of public order in China, afraid and neglected for their arbitrary repression and their inclination for violence – to transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators.
“You have the right!”
“Be tough!”
Show them, he said, “How beautiful girls look!”
Four girls who had hardly spent their adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and pants, were guarding themselves.
Four pairs of black shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four well-treated hats perfectly perched at the top of the hair attached by a blue and white drawn nod.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with negligence.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of Chinese urban inspectors.
One city required that all new recruits have a graduate degree.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged green-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced down-eye by the strong way:: in 2009, a report that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack car by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the snorkeler packed his stuff and left.
Xindu, a urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban centre of 13 women, especially selected for their appearance, their galbe and their youth.
The idea is to give the degraded police a sweeter, more female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble attracting a look at this underground Chinese urban brigade.
And for that reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these agents are allowed only to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media depicts the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the Hubei province inspectors killed an observer after he used his cell phone to film them while dispersing a protest against a waste disposal.
Last year, a manual of training for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put on the internet, describes how to effectively defeat criminals without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a pastel catcher was abandoned with a brain injury after a struggle with five officers.
A violent video game, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to attack street sellers.
"Chengguan has marked the government," said last year China Daily, a national publication, after another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded a “true complete cleaning.”
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, asked if women had real tasks or if they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of the two.
The district announcement demanded female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five traits of the face in the right order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officers said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” said a district official to Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
“First of all, the candidate’s external qualities will determine whether they fit; it’s about size, weight, face traits, etc.”
Then comes the temperament and the “internal qualities.”
Chengguan women are like flowering vessels, he said, adding: “In addition to being vessels, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the traits of the face.
What this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Persons with disabilities or disabilities should not apply.
“We can’t let a boxing person or a bossu come to serve here,” says Mr. Zheng.
“He’t give a good image.”
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has the backs with a finely incurved mouth.
She does not consider the highlighting of her appearance as being sexist, she says.
“Do you think I’m looking sexy in this uniform?” she asked with a misleading appearance.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old fosset colleague, says: “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They do not oppose their mandate to be limited, they said, because they feed greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen ambulant merchants who move quickly by foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bowl as possible before taking the escape.
“Mr. Wang, you have to go.”
“We’ve already told you several times!” said Ms. Xu as a seller had escaped by foot, temporarily leaving her nuts bicycle.
The agents describe their functions rather as monotonous than hard.
“It’s about the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, a 20-year-old who studies marketing after work.
“A great routine.”
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of sellers.
They can only threaten to report the offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province, rebelled after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chengguan agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were shot down or shot down.
Xindu has so far escaped from such a violence.
But peace is not guaranteed.
Just two patches of houses on the placed Baoguang Square, where women's officers patroled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaid on the trottoir rather than in a store, as the regulations impose them.
The motorcycle owner was screaming to the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, with a sinister face, broke the road to their vehicle and departed at all speeds with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white mark returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or more - play purely a support role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to maintain a curated image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors at the Ministry of Justice have lifted the criminal accusations against Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case linked to an assistant of a former campaign and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the wife's husband, the Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his case makes the big national titles last year and damages his career.
Mr. Ensign’s office said he was “very happy” with the decision, a result of a year-long investigation.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senator Ethics Committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Ministry of Justice had “informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case.”
The Ministry of Justice has refused to comment on this.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a profitable lobbying job to win Mr. Hampton and his wife's silence, Cynthia, about the Senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ennsign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funding donors to find a job for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they engaged Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was for a year prohibited by the law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems in contradiction with the so-called ban of the turn-door lobbying.
According to the evidence that was made public, “there seems to be a prima facie proof of a conspiracy with a view to violating and substantial violation of the turn-door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending customers from a government investigation.
Although the ministry judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the ministry seemed to be cautious of political prosecution after a number of high-level reverses charged by its public integrity section, including the decisions taken last year to give up the prosecution against former senator Ted Stevens accused of fault of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, the General Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s chief lawyer, said in an interview that he had received a phone call on Monday from a prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up on the next day, telling him that the ministry was not looking for accusations against his client.
Ensign's lawyer team had collaborated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable to get into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to give up an investigation following an independent complaint by the Ethics Group, claiming that Mr. Ensign's parents paid $96,000 to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The election commission said it had not enough evidence to prove that the money was everything except a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying jobs.
A e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign’s head of office, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he “martelled” the Ministry of the Interior on a controversial issue.
Mr. Ensign also took part in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he engaged Mr. Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of the case appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his post of leader in the fourth Republican rank in the Senate.
Afterining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to strike a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tapping far in the rows of the audience room.
They sent every minute horrible testimony reports via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family, in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already submitted documents to the court that draw up appeal arguments, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and extended use by Twitter journalists - created a "cirque atmosphere", a so widespread and instant saturation with fire details that the jury was badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could drive the appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
“I’ve experienced it during this trial; I think there’s a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the trial rooms is a violation of the rights of the person to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, M. Hayes’ lawyer, chief lawyer.
The judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of the State, laconically rejected the claims in the judgment last week, claiming that the media were "customly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been animated by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the question.
The appeal courts have recognized for decades that the media coverage of famous cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment that date, the U.S. Supreme Court canceled the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial" due to the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts appealed to review a half-century later Mr. Hayes' condemnation may be curious given the argument that new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue affirms that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from the hearing rooms could allow fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers, which is likely to be discussed for years; which delays the execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered a damage when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes during the jury selection.
Some of the jury said they were horrifying by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been critical before the prosecutors, and that he abusively put the pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to debate on a weekend.
The jury was not arrested.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, submitted last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the post of governor and the U.S. Senate.
They that the computer media continued to raise the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily tweeting of media, cameras and journalists in front of the Palace of Justice,” the lawyers wrote, “was nothing like what had been seen before here, in New Haven, and even on a national scale.”
Their emphasis on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the claim that instant news was more fireful than the communications delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would weaken the court’s policy of governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that the appeal courts were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes’ lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision that had revoked Dr. Sheppard's condemnation because of the media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can civilization bring the divisions closer?
After a campaign marked by invective and negative, a minimum of civilisation broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a pre-current sign of a real bipartisan cooperation forward or of an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders did not produce any breakthrough on the major issues that must be dealt with during the “cannard box” session.
But of course, there has been at least a polious discussion on the differences between the two parties as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The public meeting of the presidential deficit committee on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but that, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
The two sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed party war.
That’s why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s tax, expenses, health care or taxes, both parties stay miles away.
However, the November elections had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
This is inevitable after the election.
The elections raise partisan passions and then they disappear.
It is good.”
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the “cannard box” session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire by the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment allocations, even though only because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment compensation to the unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, more optimism plays on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session concerning the “cannard box” with the ratification of the “New START” pact.
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institution, warns that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th congress will meet in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable.
“When the things that must be done will be so, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilisation would lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what’s happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he says.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present to the tea who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to be at the height of their promises to reduce public spending and to abolish the new health care law.
These supporting positions are already clear in the first reactions to the deficit committee’s recommendations that include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, slowing the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the hardest tasks in Washington and have, according to themselves, imposed the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had difficulty achieving that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group’s elected; which suggests that there is little reason or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggles between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of supportive confrontations, since the Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
the public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the supportive spirit of recent elections, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Whoever is judged in loss will have to change direction and find compromises.
But it would be an optimistic point of view.
Partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and it seems there is a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilisation exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort from both sides to find an agreement on the issues that still divide them.
US documents describe Moscow as a hole of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and makes part of the wine pots and the protection money it collects pass to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out enormous rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its part as money goes to the top of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expelled.
It was written as Iouri Loujkov was still the mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there have been few traces of cleaning since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied corruption accusations over the years; and he has won several diffamation trials on these accusations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe, at an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unusual to conceive that it would be diplomatic from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "disfunctional" and to claim that the government functioned more as a kleptocratie than a government," the embassy notes.
Criminal elements enjoy a “krysha” (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means “cover” or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Prosecutor’s Office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City Government.
“The analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow.”
“Luzhkov is at the top.”
“The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level.”
“At last, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB is stealing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get the protection of the MVD and the FSB (not organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by the law."
That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.”
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly see their business closed under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly mentioned the fight against corruption, but he has admitted little progress.
The embassy’s note transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrates,” said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the “think tank Indem” of Moscow.
“He is part of this bureaucracy.”
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would rise, throughout Russia, to more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which was made only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will with certainty remove dissatisfaction within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to a certain extent, for Moscow failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin made the assumption that WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger to the statements that U.S. diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
“The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in the internal policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Former Red Khmers Fighters Forced to Fight the Past
In a poorly enlightened classroom with poorly decrypted concrete walls, the director of Anlong Veng’s secondary school mentioned the man who built it, the last leader of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves Your Mok.”
“He was a good leader; and he cared for his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as “the murderer” for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of ancient Red Khmers in northwest of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former organizational soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers went to the government, the long-term loyalty is finally questioned to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed the victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, issued its first sentence against a former member of the Red Khmers, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the sadly famous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of this evolution of the situation, anxiety increased among former Anlong Veng Red Khmers fighters; complicating reconciliation efforts and their will to reintegrate into the Cambodian society.
“There are regrets and fears among the former Red Khmers but they are impotent to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent body that is conducting research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“The situation generates divisions within the families.”
Under the Kingdom of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwhelming.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the Pol Pot-United States government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla of their base located in the mountains of the West of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmers fighters began to defeat the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ing Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held the head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for his trial.
Without their benefiers, most of the former Red Khmer fighters have fallen into the black misery, common to the rural regions of Cambodia; and many are those who remain nostalgia of the movement.
Although some Red Khmer elite officers have retained their local leader positions in exchange for depositing the weapons, they are unqualified low-grade and file farmers.
“These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are embedded by the utopian agraire ideology of the regime.”
"They have been raised in a framework where doing business is a stranger concept."
Sir Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice cultivator.
“Life under the Red Khmers was good,” he said.
“Ta Mok feeds everyone.”
But now, life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs.”
The current Red Khmers court has also caused concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Red Khmer minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the high leaders and the main responsible for the crimes but it has not said if it prosecuted beyond these four cases.
It would need more to calm the fears at Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, a 64-year-old former district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma Barrier, a project where thousands of forced workers had been killed.
Recently, during a torride evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field located near his wooden house on pilotis, on a ground road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“The country is peaceful and stable,” she said.
“If there is more persecution, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that an instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians contest this.
“The Cambodia must hide a hole and buri the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all that Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
“The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to re-connect the broken pieces,” he says.
“We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Red Khmers, "A History of Democratic Campuchia, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
"They doubt themselves because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a road, invaded by the bad herbs and filled with plastic bags, leads to a black swing rectangle, covered with a roasted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pipe of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 year old, a cell phone seller on the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who was burned at that place.
“But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot’s last place of rest where she would leave a bouquet of mature bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus to give up its military-quality uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the edge of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have released the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military quality uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This opened the way to an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a official who mentioned the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the 47 nations’ Nuclear Security Summit, held on Obama’s initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently it was profitable to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit, in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, chairman of the Global Security Partnership, a group for the promotion of nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama agreed in Prague in April 2009 to safeguard all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is the seventh.
A dozen countries did this under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and weakly enriched uranium,” said Mr. Loukachenko.
“It’s our product... We won’t make dirty bombs, and we won’t sell it to anyone.”
“We’ll use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, demonstrating interest in achieving an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was complicated because the material had been slightly radiated, officials said.
It was charged on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and removed, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace the research facilities in Belarus with weakly enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A thorough coordination and organization have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the energy department specializing in Reducing the Global Threat.
According to estimates of the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is trying to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tensioned for years, mainly due to Loukachenko’s hard repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
“With congratulations on the progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remain essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has no objection to CIA flights.
The government has not issued any objection to the flights of the CIA with prisoners from Taliban and Al Qaeda towards Guantanamo across Spain, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cable) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to “be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft that crossed Spain.”
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council’s report “has surprised the government of Zapatero out of play” and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection regarding intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to prevent them from being taken "in the absence," Aguirre reports in a cable.
At that time, the head of the Foreign Ministry, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "will give this case the lowest profile possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited influence capacity."
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge’s initiative to demand the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense on the CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any incriminating elements, no sensitive information,” the Embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The U.S. has, however, shown its concern for “the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors” more than for the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly maneuver the case between governments,” Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Internal Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are crazy jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of a flammed rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expressed concern over the PP’s action in this case.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will surely take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States,” she said.
The parish, who passed to confessions, complained in the network of the "acablement" of being a mother
The girl spoke about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this surname she used as soon as she was young, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two originating from Noia, the village of Coruña from which she is originating.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrial.
Their relationship lasted one year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never allowed him to take the DNA test.
We found another friend shortly after that.
The elected was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is heard that their idyll has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Minorque, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and angry for the fact that I came there to work."
"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then, she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to go home this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If she doesn't like it, let him leave the boy with my mother, and I'll take him when I go home," she says.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going away, but I'll only stay there until 19 because on 20 I have to present myself to a job to not lose it."
She explained that if everything went well, she would have taken her oldest with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person unless that person is not my mother," doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July there is another post.
When she tape it, it is supposed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he was supposedly murdered on the 10, was dead.
"Caesar is happy on the one side, but he is not on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and this place likes him a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day.”
She talks about a trip to Mallorca.
“It will go there (the child) in a few hours of summer and so I save a little money from the baby-sitter.”
17 Congratulations and complaints.
“A very big bishop from Caesar, who asks me when you’ll come.”
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which videos in the email, you see, when he wants, he finds me, shit."
The 30, another: "The child is well, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: “He advances me with money.”
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
“Terror to the Galician (epigraphic)”.
The last man who lived with her, watchful, declares her regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had passed so that she didn’t tell her the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial prison in Palma, from the court prison centre in Minorque.
The office lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she doesn’t remember how the facts had happened, “and she didn’t even have the intention to hurt the minor.”
She had previously confessed that she drowned Caesar in the bathroom and placed his body in a bag.
The defendant and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric examination.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these comices normally doubles that it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections they obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384.091 votes.
If this ascending trend isined, desired by a distortion of votes from the PSC and the fidelization of the PP electorate, the analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 members in Congress, while CiU would also win four (he still has 10) and the PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 members (he has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - he has three now - while ICV would retain one deputy or win one.
But if the electoral agenda isined, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relays at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populists agree that PSC could lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority nor the possibility to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Having in mind the Republican breakdown, it would not be fantastic that this formation loses its representation in the mayority of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP only recorded a difference of 500 votes compared to the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros,ins very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The populations have recorded progress also in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and seeks to form lists in a maximum number of locations.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian detained by agents of the Barcelona Police's General Information Commissionariat formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigres for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the author of the Bombay attacks that caused the deaths of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point to ensure that with the “operation Kampai” has “weakened” the al-Qaeda counterfeiting machine at international level and “as a result, its operational capacity”.
Investigators calculate that the cell, during the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its “combaters” could cross the European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only that the jihadist network held operational in Europe, that’s why in the investigations have participated, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, that’s why in the territory of the European Union there might be the following days of similar strikes to those recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were held), another was held in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who directed from Bangkok the cell implanted in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network – part of which was hit in 2009 – mostly steal from tourists the passports that met the conditions marked by the “World Islamic Front”.
That is, the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Investigators emphasize that so far there is no detail that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, although the author of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the integrants of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have taken over a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which resume to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-souverainist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address to the half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that it gives the fact that it has obtained 18 members at the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, since the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the voting of the investiture.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are made as key to Catalonia.
And as regards the president of the PP, to support an investment “there should be eliminated all the sovereignist and independentist speeches” and the economic complicity – similar to that of the Basque Country – that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to weaken the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the Mas investment negotiation will be taken by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Georgian Department says the deaths were not due to "no measures"
The owner of the Olot center does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse had killed more than 11 elderly people
Officials of the La Caritat d'Olot (Geron) have offered a press conference yesterday to emphasize the damages caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interval that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the centre’s lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that “the desire of La Caritat would be that of being able to exercise the accusation against the responsible” for the dead but “the legality and responsibility obliges us to assume the processual situation of civil responsible.”
And in addition to the social discreditation that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the great threat for La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day it has not ceased to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients from the geria - he suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally investigating the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures may not have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in this case there is only an indication of imprudence from any other person other than the accused.”
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" admitted before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting him a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the center staff to medical care.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the internals, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila did not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them washing as he already admitted that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the declarations of the night nurse, nor the number of assassinations confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the First Instance Tribunal and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after successfully committed eight assassinations.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of the justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The Bank threatens
Investors reacted suddenly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday which warned that "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The differentials of the devices closed at force and the shares of European banks suffered more than 5%.
However, we should not also underestimate the ECB’s ability to make a mistake and the euro has hardly recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will lose the fear.
One month ago, the ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining.
Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will keep the quarterly auction sale with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the generated expectations, they will turn down the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to remove the liquidity measures, let God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be reliable and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Last year, the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 base points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sense after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The figures are estimated to represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumptable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relieve the tension before the next Summit of the Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange passed 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchange.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was fast and radical and we enjoy the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will be solved with a strong demand and helps to dissolve doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be a self-immulation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don’t need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar’s wife, “other than being, seeming.”
Courage, we can get out of it.
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, will challenge, because he considers it "no right", the court council of El Enebro on the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to claim their majority and take over the management bodies of the company holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control by one part of the group.
The founder of the bigger business services holding for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his board he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed administrators in the assembly of shareholders on January 18 this year whose contestation is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16th, called by the Commercial Magistrat No. 2 of Madrid, has again opened the tuner box within the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants of his five sons to try, through a processual argument, clearly frauduling the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18", according to his official spokesman.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is held, to be contested, considering that the assembly is “null of full right”.
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate calls an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, requires the use of 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantial question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the appeal request for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this selected world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In the first moment, no one took into account the options of a new edge that was just arriving, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without decreasing the skill as the champion’s pilot, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the Formula 1 world we talk about the legend of the “secret weapon” that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives from the high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains from factory manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding undeniable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in short hours, almost in real time”, the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 edges had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team currently employs 180 high-qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes on the bulbs.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull boards except the engine, which is Renault’s exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can pass from the simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has deployed the high-tech factory to create and produce its bolids in a town 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered “top secret.”
The staff for this duty is 580 people, including two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula 1 hero is Sebastian Vetell.
Among the enormous technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put to the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is inestimable and null reputation.
Factory’s technology director, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D progress in the case of racing cars brought 50% of the victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while drivers bring 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, because “they are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP will install 20 clean stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational planned to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-mark centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain’s vice president, Helena Herrero, has given as an example the renovated store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which it has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opened were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third in Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will keep an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores claims to “upgrade the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchase, support, post-sales and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneer pilot program that solves possible problems with HP’s computer equipment guaranteed.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
“This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical support services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bet on ‘flighting’ a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the delegated administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it predicts a collapse of interest margins, which will be attempted to partially compensate with increases of the commissions and the credit price.
Sabadell expects to capture a million individual customers in three years, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit over the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will hold a three-year lability.
The goal, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to FROB’s public subsidies, is to gain a market share by capturing a million new individual customers – 700,000 if one deduces those who can get out of the bank – its great task to accomplish, because so far this bank had damaged more SMEs and companies than the individual customer.
This year it captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as a goal, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public because the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finish this year its Optima management plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for a further fiscal year.
Customers who let the savings box escape will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the outcome from the crisis in Spain “will be slow.”
Moreover, in two or three years it will be “very difficult to create jobs,” which is fundamental for the survival of the banking affairs, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which punishes the margins - is decreasing, the price of the risk bonuses that banks and cash pay for its emissions to get liquidity moves already to the price of the credit to compensate for the fall of the margins.
“The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t stretched the robinet, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector is now "to increase the commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain “there will be demanded greater dimensions.”
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He affirms that capital needs "grow greatly" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it states that the FROB may replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it has decreased the importance of the fact that some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but unlike what happened in June, we can get short-term funding through rest, which relieves the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second wave of fusion between the cash
CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of savings fusion and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the concentration trial of the Spanish savings funds began, there were several entities who assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
“I think most of the mergers have been made, we can’t say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they’re adjustments.”
“Most has been done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the tutelage of the Bank of Spain, who has collaborated a lot in this operation as well,” he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executive Officials of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process takes place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it takes place in the deadlines that have been fixed in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he said.
“The passage from 45 cash with an average of 28.500 million asset volume to 17 with 75.500 million is an uneven trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much bigger to be in accordance with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of fairly unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year."
CECA’s chief executive, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and “probably” in the world and attributed to those who doubt it a “knowledge deficiency”.
The manager mentioned that given the current economic situation, “we can stay very quiet” with the situation of financial entities and savings, a system that started a “very important” concentration process and “go at the fastest possible”.
He also reminded that the Spanish banking sector was well out of the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin chose to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of €426 unemployed aid without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as regards her responsibility to dissolve the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction to the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks with that ofining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of Mark, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budget strictness, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no place for apologies.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a difference between what Germany thought we should do (tax rigorous plans and public finances stability) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second coup of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then, it has been criticized, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and public opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for a reform of the EU treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time force private borrows to bear a portion of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although slightly sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the Union reform process that makes possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if now we have to take measures with which we may not be too agree, from that date the former functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare their payments cease and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a part of the costs.
Germany tells us that we have to follow a rigorous growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
A debt-based and construction-based alternative, with huge holes in the payment balance, such as the one that led Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
It would be bad not to hear it.
It is not only about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked is much harder.
And what he should absolutely not do in these circumstances is to mislead ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will allow us to reach greater peace.
Let us take the opportunity that we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the past Saturday meeting with the big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel’s criticism, the way has been opened to the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has traced is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, we cannot exclude that of leaving a monetary zone too full of less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us about it.
Sport and law fraud
Alonso and Ramos’ similar ruses against Ajax demonstrate the intelligence but not the willingness to escape a sanction.
The kidnapping in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has made a lot of ink flow on the anti-sport character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match ended (which their team already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the judge to show them the second yellow card.
So, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will comply with the regulatory sanction during the next match of the barrier match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned with two matches the team coach, José Mourinho and different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it takes advantage of the ethos, the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate appeared in the case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn shows nobility and honor and who in past occasions condemned to a fine to his players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds a further episode to his dilated history of historical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks if this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if with these actions a fraud of law is committed; for, in fact, they are actions that respect the sport regulation, but seem to eradicate its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sports mind.
One of the goods that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of opponent players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there has not been a violent game.
Another of these goods to which we are referred with the correct game is to avoid the team of the criminals to unfairly benefit from the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not fit to what is normally characterized as fraud or fraud of the law, since its violation of the rules has not been accomplished in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and were pleased to accept the punishment.
Another question is the type of advantage that the offenders obtain from the intentional errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to see that we do not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and we do not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action implies the fact of leaving their own team with less players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match either, as the club could not rely on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from this, with this action the players accomplish a sanction match and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the stairs, it’s not so clear that this is an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, which is still part of making strategic decisions that favour the profit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not acted to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of law fraud),m otherwise they have chosen rather the time in which they have submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without dismissing the penalty or escaping it.
Even though the border between genius and the law fraud is spread, in this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears due to two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way the director transmitted to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar focuses this year on an avalanche of reservations for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tour and the lottery, when December comes back also the dinner of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have led to an offensive you price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinner or meals, coincide businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
To finish complicating accounting, the calendar of this year (as the Night of St. Sylvester falls on Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting as a result so far an avalanche of dinner reservations for the pic days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the source of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation is, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
“People think a lot before booking.”
“They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with a good service," he adds, and reminds that customers tend to go down a staircase with the crisis, so the gap around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
A survey in various establishments of the center found the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group says there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim of spending less than 30 euros, to which they answered by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar supposed more anticipated reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The group’s sources mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than the last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, confesses in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and claims that overall reservations are "animated", even if the guests "go to the maximum".
This is true, the hope regarding holidays has not dropped, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at “a faster pace than any other country.”
WikiLeaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes to Washington.
In addition to the enlightening and tasty details they offer on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited at Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, “destroy” and that the instable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “in a faster pace than any other country in the world.”
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in case of attack – is one of the main reasons for concerns in Washington.
This is how Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations to the territory under the attack of the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferant and a reason forining the guard.
"Pakistan has to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decrease in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said during a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The new of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high degree of nuclear weapons production.
A message from the Embassy in May, which quotes the communication with Pakistan as “frustrating”, supports the following: “Transparency is often unexisting; aid offers remain unresponse or are eliminated.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it “very clearly” to the official that “the Army of Pakistan must end with the silent support of terrorist groups.”
The Hunting of the Wikileaks Chief
Obama will appoint a senior responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol has issued a red warning to track the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to have a certainty about the facts.
Interpol issued a “red warning” to “localize and track Assange’s movements.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
This is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20th.
And this has nothing to do with the last filtering of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Additionally, Wikileaks' founder lawyer Mark Stephens says that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
The 20th international police body with headquarters in Lyon (France) has dictated the order on request of Sweden, but it has not made it public until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest order of a person affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization’s explanations, consider the call red notice a free way for arrest—which the national police body must accomplish—especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be located.
The movement harassed Assange’s lawyers, who last week published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks has shown himself willing to answer by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remind that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
“This seems to be a hunting, not a legal persecution,” the missive says.
While the world is looking for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he does not silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they spy to the UN by violating the international treaties that the U.S. has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridical and absurd."
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents from being leaked.
The President's spokesman Barack Obama's attempt to reduce Assange's importance contradicts the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the Congressman who will from January preside the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber, asked the State Department to study the possibility to include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute any person who provides contributions or assistance to them.”
Even further has gone Tom Flanagan, a counselor of Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has to return to his statements after saying that Assange will have to be "assassinated".
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something similar.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
“He who is in the government who filters the information is guilty of betrayal and whatever is not an execution would be a very friendly punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eye clins to Carod's supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the second internal rebellion within the ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party’s chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it can absolutely not give him the headaches he had with other deleted currents.
That’s why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eye clins that allow him to blind up to the municipal elections.
For a start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC counselors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
Through voting but not lifting the hand.
If the carodists want to bring a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of rejection.
In fact, the head of ranges wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he said he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than put his position at the disposal of the militants, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise of scheduling the congress for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders consider a safe fact.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” affects stability and its goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash his family room wash.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various goals" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he highlights two.
The first, to “recompose” the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militance, i.e., to include new figures that come from Carod’s adept sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a functioning mechanism.
Thus, he advocates a statute reform that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, who has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion commissioned the management to review the assembly model in a specific congress to reform the Statute.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal wave of recent years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical sectors at the outskirts, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILLENIO of the state of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month, according to MILLENIO of the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two dead bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
During the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
The body was found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, town of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of fire and the thanksgiving to the head, except the feet and hands attached with a cable.

One day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was killed with eight shots when he came out of his house to initiate the waste collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a head shooting each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shooting in the front, a man's body was found on a solitary road from Colonia El Naranjo and under the body a bullet hit with a 25-caliber firearm was found.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a thorough search for the rest of the body, but they were not found.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a body that was in Peña Colorada, with hands attached behind and eyes banded.
The man had a wound caused by a fire shot in the neck.
In the middle of the month it was the execution of two men who had been covered in coverings and left in the box of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán municipality of Zaragoza, it was discovered at the same time with the victims two death warning messages.
One day later, a carton box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found embedded in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, covered in coverings, two women were found in the Zoquiapan camp of the Ixtapaluca municipality and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was localized that had been covered in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, in accordance with a message that his executives had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with firearms in the neck, a woman's dead body was found in the San Francisco Acuautla cave.
On the woman's skin, Santa Muerte's tattoos and collars with her image were detected.
By the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the Zinacantepec municipality with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the head and a message were found in the Bridge of Piedra community, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, saying, “This is what happens to those who do not align.”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and legs attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been surrounded in black plastic bags, attached with a cannella tape and a message next; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
Chinains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The country’s representative at COP16 assured that its country has made huge efforts to reduce carbon trace and detailed that itins its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
Chinains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made huge efforts to reduce coal trace and re-convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, the country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he clearly mentioned that China will not change its goals, but will continue to work together with the international community in this field.
He mentioned that the Chinese strategy in the field of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institutions building and pilot programs support.
There has been progress in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he emphasized that in China, federal authorities have worked in a way coordinated with government and local authorities to the energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multiannual plans ongoing or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing incandescent lamps by economical lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, he exposed, the emission per capita of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historic contribution to contamination.
Likewise, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Expulsion of Espino: Caesar Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what law.
PAN national leader César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what law.
In the interview before the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as the state governor, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
“Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body,” he noted.
On the other hand, he explained that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the next 4 and 5 December internal elections where a successor should be elected.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiation table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for local elections that has succeeded and achieved its goal," he said.
Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition doesn't scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will undoubtedly be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give it "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely calm and open, I'd be proud to leave the party's chair office to any of the five."
He planned that the party's recovery to the last 4 July elections will be reflected in the next dispute, although "there's not yet time to think about 2012."
“At the moment it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task.”
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments that come from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that "a lot of hopes have been made regarding them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations."
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, Caesar Nava asked the priists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas have been better than those of Fox and Calderón; let them begin to defend them; let them get out of the ‘armament’,” he said.
He said that the holder of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no shell, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes bill on Twitter for papers-free students
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve that legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize paperless students, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve that legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote for the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the expansion of Bush's time tax cuts and government funding extend.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act Act and other projects, President's spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is solved we will be able to set a agenda for the rest of the projects.
“I think we have a lot of time...”
“We all agree that this fiscal problem must be solved before the end of the year.”
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in this direction and then we will be able to plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "debat closing vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize paperless students could be voted from Thursday next in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they have stayed in this country for the last five years and they have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the contribution of a large number of Republicans, in times when the project supporters protagonists an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Law.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That’s why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courtified Republicans are the Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing Senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed the term Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but they said they would not support it in another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put the finger on the wound.
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants spread the narrative.
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do you hope of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and who this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
“The finger on the wound puts us in embarrassment,” the Argentine writer gently threw to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and to which participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what is the "plage", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting a response, only traces in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she goes out convinced: “Patience is not my strength, it’s my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scarring."
The protagonist breathed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is who is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and the tongue traps must be very connected to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a stunning narrative he has titled ‘Hello to the Invention’, where the finger on the wound is not named but at a given time is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he talks about a famous narcissist who touched clouds, returned people who had gone far or repaid the virtues that a damn girl had lost, a narration that turns to talk then America, the great news that has had from the beginning its own chronicles and quotes to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excess of the narrations of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (writers) laughed on the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in an astonishing way we would never have told the history of America with a imagination that lacked even the pudding."
However, he emphasized, "the fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, we no longer know which part of the narration belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the “Cervantes tradition”.
“Through his heritage we are what we tell.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with her round table He must on the wound.
The Cuban-Portorican has put its own on the great wound of social violence that its country passes – and Latin America shares – producing disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
“I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course predicted,” she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a “chemical reaction” of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "it owes on the wound of the writer engaged".
He considered that in a world that lives in great speed also as regards intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, “there is a little no behind every affirmation and behind every denial there is a little yes.”
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and disturbing also the powers who prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman in the hunt of his first title
Ruben Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had high and low in his career, but he was able to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that face, marked by their technicians, who find each other a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he was able to reach three times the decisive series, although so far he has not put in the thousand and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended by comforting himself with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist arrived to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open Tournament when he held Morelia's ranks with which he lost with a total score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Close he also arrived in the decisive duel and lost again with the total score of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a reverse, as his team made a match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the penalties series he gained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he doesn’t want to have the same fate, he tries to get rid of the malfeat to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I'm going to get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he commented when he was asked what his weak points would be in the final.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson that we can keep in mind is that until the arbitrator sweeps the final, we can't celebrate, we're prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think that's a lesson, before the end of the match we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which doesn’t worry him, because he trusts his players: “We’re never trying to get to the series of penalties, we’re trying to end in the regular time, but sometimes it’s only left us to prepare, the previous tournament we’ve been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it’s the emotions or anxiety of holding the title in our hands, hands he escaped us, this has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope we don’t get in that situation anymore.”
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
EU changes rules for visa
People must go to the Visa Applicants Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will be changed.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to present themselves to the Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will present certain advantages for aspirants, among which the following are mentioned:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get a date, another payment for the visa processing and another for the postal service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current fee will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 in the case of visa with request (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors' visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves at the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and their footprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who want a second date to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search of living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce a astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 in the NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which caused speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures like us and in hostile environments that one thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that “there is a different form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know.”
The space agency will report the actual scope of the discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), with the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opposition
With reforms to Congress’ Organic Law, the arrival of ‘bipartism’ is made possible, they denounce.
The 60th was just setting up when in Congress appeared an opposition block led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared independence and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' to the Chambers.
Before initiating the 60th Legislature installation session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tone' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they repeated, the 'bipartism' is initiated because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only to vote against the Directorate presided by the PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will be served again by the two parties and thus will end the opposition coalition.
“When this has happened (the opposition coalition), that’s what I look at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that’s why they form a plural group.
It cannot be permitted, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic."
“It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is eternal bipartism in Congress.”
To begin, this group begins with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more, the Convergent abundantly said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'butin' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the person of the deputy, to give him his place to the negotiating tables.
“They don’t leave by cupular agreements out to 5 which will probably be 9 members, now to the five we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiation table, that’s the problem, that in the reform they have done, that they have decided, we are out and we are not agree with that reform.”
$200 million more for the “Supplier”
The Municipality of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the question owner of the electric equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Municipality.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electric equipment company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Transparency page of the Municipe, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said the municipality would pay additional amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Higher Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been is the total debt and, therefore, checks will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“We’ve not bought anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Even if the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the law forecasts when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a review of the checks that the City Council issued to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the three-year term of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, collecting checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites should be carried out.
Tourism entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad conditions of the Sanchez Taboada round point in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a hole in Sanchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, reminded that they have repeatedly called for the destination image to be treated and new activities need to replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the bad state of the streets and trottoirs has affected because tourists come there to walk and they see the disorder and avoid the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the wealth that we lose, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without adequate planning.”
Hotel manager José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the Municipality.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid this happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just doing the corrective," he said.
“We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we must maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the mayor must change its strategy to well maintain the city.”
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as for example Escudo and Venadito of Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it doesn't just depend on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention needed and this type of facts emphasizes something that is known to everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of the Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that have to get online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city updated, clean, ordered and that it is attractive because it has a tourist destination.
“Fortunately, Mazatlán offers a lot of historic and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination.”
IP calls for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, CEC Chairman, proposed that the MPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa due to the various provocations it faces.
Mazatlán’s business sector calls for a decent and agreement-free Labour Legislature between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsioned and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature was established composed of seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 members of PAN, three members of the Party the New Alliance, two members of PRD, one members of PT, one members of Convergencia and one members of PVEM, a total of 40 people.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, CEC Chairman, proposed that the MPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa due to the various provocations it faces.
“We hope that the MPs truly exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to safeguard their own interests and they turn into a carnival mascarade of governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions.”
That’s why I ask them to confirm their commitment to building the necessary bridges that make the current Governor progress.
“We will ensure that they do a worthy and mostly committed work with society and the sectors as the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Association of Tres Islas Hotels, said one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces seeking the economic growth of the state, since now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and this in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
As regards tourism activity, he asked the new legislators to give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
“I understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a lower budget and it is unconnected as an important economic activity and generating currencies and investments and that rivals directly with the agro-industry.”
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources to explosive tourist projects that help to give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
Looking for the Magical King
Puppies, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings Mages will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, because their home is formed by neither more nor less than 12 people and a horse.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel don’t lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father has no stable job.
“Sometimes it’s very difficult for us, because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebs’ to sell on the street,” says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would want a Barbie doll.
José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long sought to have a 'monster truck' and for his younger brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive," Cayetana remembers sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, walks the size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, walks the size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, walks the size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the Campaign On Searching the Wizard King, giving a toy or money to the Northwest reception.
14 drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various accusations.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have served to drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four pounds of haschich, silver and equipment that served to production were captured,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to appear to the Sherbrooke Court Palace within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place as a result of a long breath investigation, which lasted almost a year.
“It is the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests,” said Ruel.
About 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Quebec Security Strike, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Region took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives bill, which, according to the government, is expected to solve the problem of the ships charged with illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
“I strongly rely on the Charter.”
"I stand up with a party that created the granite under your feet," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly Caucus meeting.
The liberals claim that the draft law as proposed, which would allow holding up to a year any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill, because he takes it to the wrong target.
“We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we’ll see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
NPD’s immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected from the rear hand the criticism that she wants her party not to be strong enough regarding illegal immigrants.
“Neo-Democrats agree to take measures against clandestine merchants and that’s what we do through another draft law, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the conservative bill because it takes it on refugees and imprisons children for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
“The Canadians massively say to the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, those criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a puzzle.”
“They expect Canada to take strong measures,” Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could have led the country to elections that are going to be rejected.
A conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every member who opposes will then explain himself before his voters.
The new unity does not unanimously
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigation committee on the subject.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January last.
The metropolis has a permanent unity on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement on Tuesday surprised more than one.
It must be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the Pekinist public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement a “lapin out of a hat” and a “bricked solution on the corner of a table.”
Mr Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we’re going to announce it, it’s just to say.”
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ Chairman, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the launch of a public investigation.
“The more Mr. Charest insists not to want to create this investigation commission, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have an investigation commission is the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests Quebec to give a special mandate to the general inspector so that he investigates collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the general inspector,” he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government’s cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Prosecutor of the Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this kind of investigations.
Federal Public Security Minister Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently looking at some amendments related to the case.
During the 2001 Spring Operation, which hit cyclists groups, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa has adopted the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under High Surveillance
Several waters are still under high surveillance due to the strong rainfall that has crashed on several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated.
In the evening, another sliding would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road was broken.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall took place in several regions, or 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
Further 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these rainfall must be added to the flooding of snow already accumulated in some sectors, we are afraid of the overflow of several water courses.
Flood warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Quebec Civil Security for the rivers Ouareau and the Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood surveillance and remained under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, heavy rainfall led to the overflow of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rain.
Ten residents had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on a warning foot and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Crude Forecast Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of strong crude for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Oareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partly blamed
Quebec radio-animator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial reverse before the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his wave-to-wave gross language.
The CCNR judges that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinions, but that some statements contained “the inaccurate information on social assistance, unduely negative representations of Haitians and the hard language that is not suitable for the broadcasts during the day.”
The Council also concluded that a suicide discussion, including the dissemination of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Social Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators should present solid information rather than misleading.
When it comes to suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the committee members concluded that the transmitted message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life problems.
“The majority of the committee considers that the controversial episodes of ‘Dupont le Midi’ have addressed a delicate topic in a fair and appropriate way.”
Therefore, no blame was held in his place.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then delivered themselves to a face-to-face media that had caused a lot of reactions.
The animator of CHOI said he had not done any donations to help the Haitians because it was not possible to know with certainty that the people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unfairly negative representation of the Haitians.
“I’ve already cleaned my three-day suspension on that.”
“My file is virgin for a year and a half,” the animator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of gross language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM has collaborated “ beyond its obligation”.
The consequences are minimal for the station that will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of large hearing within three days.
King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealese of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special path.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing runs on the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,” Zemmal, who has been installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals, said.
“In my case, I’m looking for struggles somewhere, since for those who don’t like playing on the ground present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, who works as a security agent and as a committed for the UPS company just delivered bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won the full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he said.
“Today, I am preparing to go to China for the World Cup in San Suu Kyi.”
“The fighters who ended among the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited.”
“I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto.”
“In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth.”
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in the fifth place, while I got third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
“In this pace, I’ll be the first this time or next year!”
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where kick and foot strikes, as well as ground projections, are permitted.
Duels originally take place on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of fighting is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well-recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence in the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
“This competition is the most highlighted and most prestigious in China,” the sympathetic gaillard explained.
“This is a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal won his first battle, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed.”
“There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).”
“The winners of the semi-finals are confronted in the final of their category.”
Then the winners of each category are faced in order to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu.
$450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Quebec has granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by companies BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor that has obtained the most important, that of the project management, for a total of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium called Energy Management was established in 2004 in conjunction with the choice of Hydro-Quebec to assign to the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management consortium withdrawn the profitable contract without public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing a price rise.
“This is the new way to make collusion and break down competition.”
“It is, people, instead of doing this in a secret way, now do it in an open way,” Pekin deputy Sylvain Simard said on a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard to see how the interests of the public can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my journey,” she said, claiming that the PQ had been “unrighteous” and had “not been rigorous.”
She said that “this would be the least of the things” that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to gather their respective expertise in order to respond to an offer call for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The construction is ongoing and is expected to extend until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition to act; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the engineering-consulting sector is the subject of an investigation by the government.
A fast overflow from the Quebec Register of Companies allows to count over 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same moral person, i.e. Dessau.
As for the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau emphasized that “the territory of the Bay James responds to particular workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Quebec responds to it in a particular way since the 1970s.”
The great boss of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the Bay James Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that led to the fact that the project management contract was granted voluntarily.
"If you go on tender and there are few tenderers, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people that are in that market and say, we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and at a good price."
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that’s important, it’s people’s competence,” Mr. Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has counted 109 engineering-consulting contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin replied 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $2951,131,564.
Sylvain Simard said the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are “good known to the Liberal Party of Quebec.”
Minister Normandeau left it down that the QP is also linked to those companies that “financed” it, before stating that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but honestly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in the stakeholders of sustainable development, but also in fair brands and ecologizing certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if he swim in a media universe where messages in favour of a more responsible consumption pull, he regrets a lack of credible information, a lack he calls even a barrier to his commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, however, Quebecs seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of as well as the green advertising of, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Responsible Consumer Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certifications imposed on so-called fair products, but also the reliability of the products and brands that appear to be ecologically responsible, the Barometer says.
In the same venus, the political speech on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec.
Responsible consumption information, however, appears to be crucial to stimulate this consumption pan currently animated by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and the doubtful nature of information would calm the burns of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, one-third of Quebec citizens also say they are suspicious of the alleged performance of the green products or services that are sought to put in their hands.
On another note, half of consumers in 2010 have changed their habits and most importantly changed the brand of one or more products to meet their convictions.
At a height of 61%, they also favoured purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products cultivated in their region, the Barometer says.
More green and responsible – the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year – the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness, however, seems to remain outside his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, only 28% of Quebec citizens indicated that they used public transportation or recommended covoiturage to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which just took its first cliché.
A state loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The government of Quebec, to which it was asked to engage financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Society of Angus and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but at the competition of a loan only.
The Development Society Angus and the Parallel, who hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the St. Laurent boulevard by giving him his full film vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to engage in the case, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would otherwise be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least according to the opinion of sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and a demand of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been reviewed to decline.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilot the dossier of eXcentris.
He gave him a last report a decade ago.
But the counterproposal of the cabinet arrived at the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of state donation really needs to be excluded.
Remember that the Association of Cinematic and Cinematic Parks owners of Quebec opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has no need to finance real estate projects, which it did not for other cinemas.
However, a number of members of the community demanded substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of heavens, has for ten years carried out the author's cinema in his complex locations after he himself funded its construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalise its customers.
The Angus and the Parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, run, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push to the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27 next by projecting the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini didn’t remember The duty and we don’t know what he and his group think of the downward proposals that are made to them.
The vessel raised on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the U.S. considers as the complex of inferiority of Canadians to the Americans, but they at the same time betray the feeling of superiority of Canadians to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter doesn’t have the Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government to make its budget adopted in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread on the public square yesterday, offer more cruel details than substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in full federal election campaign, tells how much the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
The US Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
"A almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday internal issues rather than bring this election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: all-present, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador even less understands that “thinking silence” that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government survives during the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, through which Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan,” Breese writes.
Nothing is mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional to the quality of the proposed reset plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast to CBC are referring to from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts, in which we see little subtle references to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or the kidnappings for the CIA’s muscular interrogations.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he delivered a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
“The Secretary agreed to review the case.”
Let’s finally note that the minds are warming about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on the waves of CBC that the man responsible for this massive escape should be "assassinated".
Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Restore Lighting
The UN proposed a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to a reduction in greenhouse gases (GES) which corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction to be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the footsteps of the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of compulsory reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the incandescent lamps that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact lamps or, better, by electroluminescent diod lamps (DEL or "LED" in English), the majority of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emitted to lighting humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will need to be removed from this balance even 5 Gt to be able to stabilize the climate rise to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent lamps, 95% of energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With fluocompact lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL lamps, this energy need is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact lamps last on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new DEL lamps, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week – this company has also participated in the UN study – have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent lamp, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new lamps can also work with reostates in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain mercury.
Several specialists have shown reserves in the place of fluocompact lamps as they contain mercury and that they must be removed as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put instructions.
But, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompact lamp, but rather the coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity spent in incandescent lamps.
Only in the United States, these power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year on electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion dollars.
Ivory Coast awaits the announcement of the election results
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines.
“The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent electoral commission to finish its work and announce the provisional results without further delay,” a spokesman for the UN head said.
“It calls on all Ivory parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results.”
Despite the pressure exercised by some foreign governments, the election committee allowed the deadline of Wednesday's midnight to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
Approximately forty minutes before the deadline expires, the CIS chairman told television that the commission "continue working" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied worldwide on Wednesday for the ICC to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the abolition by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former Rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the missing coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the campaign director of the Ivory president, said the FN's voter intimidation maneuver in the north of the country had dissuaded the supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo are resolved by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a North man who denies any connection with the former rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results "inacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he didn't go until he claimed victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that complaining before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, Sunday, was supposed to coronate the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that was divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivory political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended in the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France according to the International Bureau of Labour (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan region (9.7% counting the overseas departments), shows the corrected data of temporary seasonal variations (CVS) published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in the metropolitan region.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in metropolitan and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In a year, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a new rise in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over a year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in terms of the BIT.
The elderly people experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan areas (+0.2 points over three months and over a year), or 482,000 people aged 50 or more, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only the 25-49 years of age benefited from a unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolitan region (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polemic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, continues to do so and announced Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini arrested and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste management companies and brother of the President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was investigated and stolen at the detention house of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation on alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been prosecuted for abuse of social assets, misconduct of funds and public assets, recell, active corruption, influence trafficking and holding ammunition, his lawyer said.
“Alexandre Guérini is fighting and wants to explain himself on all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies.”
"It's easy to pursue it for a multitude of repressible leaders, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, required, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also investigated on Wednesday evening and stolen.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to make the waste he had to manage work.
As for the allocation of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their functioning, he has never been aware of it, Me Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Services of the Agglomeration of Uganda, was investigated on Wednesday for public fund distortion and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition of meeting the protagonists of the case.
“My client has been able to provide explanations to the facts that are accused of him.”
“The instructor’s magistrate took this into account, not depriving him of freedom,” said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been investigated and released in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin, said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleaning of Marseille Provence Metropolitan (MPM), is prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption."
Two officials of the Agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being investigated, one for "the distraction and deforestation of public property by a person charged with a public service mission", the other for "complicity of deforestation of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini’s companion, Jeannie Peretti, has been prosecuted for “recel of abuse of social property.”
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been stuck in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement that affects Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have served to wash money from the big banditism.
The investigation is carried out as part of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous emails, for alleged fraud in the procurement, in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations are focused on the conditions of allocation and operation of a La Ciotat discharge, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysée exaggerated Syrian mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in France, put the diplomacy in warning, and accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attention of the US diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice for dealing with their own crises of “hostages” in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been compensated for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by U.S. justice for material trafficking for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a crue light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage the cases of hostages".
Elysée’s consultant for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d’Orsay’s director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to return their own nationals detained by force to Iran.
“Do noise,” they say, “continually marteling” in the media the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate liberation”.
It is necessary to blame the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it especially as the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
For, passed through the attempts of discussions through discreet channels, “the silence will not resolve anything,” the Iranians are “mosters in dilatory maneuveres.”
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: capturing for political chantage.”
He announces that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day when she refuges to the French Embassy) “will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money” (230,000 euros of guarantee).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
A news is spread: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal traffic of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of nuclear equipment, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted any goods?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French.
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
Elysée, he says, not only "he was completely surprised by the judge's decision", but he tried to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of seals" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the decision" judicial, he observes.
Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée counselor compiles a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not mind its efforts, by means of communications and “flights” organized in the media, to make it believed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a “important” and “influential” role of “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation brings its fruits as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 is referring to “the media ‘blitz’ of French officials.”
What is based on so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials confess in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that pushed Elysée to go into this fiction.
The intense communication effort “vises to validate Sarkozy’s policy of openness to Syria,” he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which “was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immortal.”
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The aim is also to “seed the seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The US Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Naturally, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
“But we thanked them anyway.”
“It should at least sow confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is in Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their “active role in the liberation of our compatriot.”
No Online Games for Young Koreans Last Midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Sandy" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many children play these games all night and then have trouble studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
“We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
The companies will have a year to prepare for the law, he said.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents ask for them, the man added.
It will also put at the disposal of people who demand it free software that allows to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intense use of the Internet.
The country is also the unmatched champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared to 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates organising countries
In full torment due to suspicion of corruption, the FIFA executive committee designates the organizing countries of the World Cup 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying are at risk of taking the step on the technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implantation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch government leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of the economic and political challenges of a World Cup.
Treatments in the background may last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) records have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two members of the European Union (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the chances of its country, the birthplace of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a documentary covering three influential members of the European Commission, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to disappoint the FIFA and shame the English leaders, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edite the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympics-2012.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to restore the blason of England with the European Union?
Nothing is less secure because the Spanish-Portugal duo doesn’t lack attributes with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could douche their ambitions.
Eventual repressions against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only raise the quote of Russia, becoming an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings in its dossier (stadies, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a hardly covered reference to the accusations of the British press against the members of the European Parliament.
“We’re covering them with mould, we’re trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong of the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favourites.
The world’s first economic power, headquarters of FIFA’s leading sponsors, the country seems to have a length ahead of Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very nice project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries who co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat is the award of the World Cup-2026 to China, which was fiercely desired by the FIFA, which would actually make the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which made the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (for the time gap) by European countries, the nerve of war for the FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him believe he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate to the Elysée calls for another.
The current president will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not make a good home with the part of mystery attached to the presidential office.
It should be as if the doubt is still there.
In one way as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "where in the autumn of 2011".
That he spoke in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening in Elysée, the perspective of "two mandates" has thus sowed a little feveriness.
Was this the official announcement of his nomination?
We were far away.
The president only reminded that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five years to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he speaks about the presidential election, in the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"In the worst, or in the best, you still have it for seven and a half years with me," he had launched them in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't believe that I don't think about the next step."
His words of yesterday do not make him more candidate than the previous day; they do not make him less.
If there are comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it’s not the entry into the league of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
It is, on the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS demand a battle order earlier than planned.
The bad surveys on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," the Prime Minister's surroundings immediately and cautiously reacted.
“If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrected Alain Juppé, clearly resigned.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its acquisitions of state securities
The last meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) Council of Governors of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the ways to get out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a number of non-conventional monetary policy transactions that must be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges, the Frankfurt emission institution will not be able to afford to be so peremptory under the penalty of worsening a situation more than today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
On a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde congratulated the active role played by the ECB in the resolution of the debt crisis in Europe.
She didn’t want to say if she thought the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program of purchase of sovereign bonds.
“I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)”.
The European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECB) said the ECB’s chairman, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more discerning about his intentions, just indicating that the secondary market acquisition program was “continuing” and that “we’ll see what we’ll decide” at the meeting on Thursday.
The ECB will keep its main directional rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level in history since May 2009.
In fact, Treasury bond purchases by the ECB doubled last week, to 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretion of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have purchased for €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, the anticipations of a continuation of purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
The economists also do not expect a remarkable directional change.
While borrowing transactions for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB continues to make unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this system to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she's changing her program significantly."
"Otherwise it would take the risk of causing new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“A progressive outcome announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
of Oppenheim.
In the framework of its interventions on the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these obligations to encourage an atomic market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area’s sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no other choice than to maintain its market presence.
"He must at any price replace the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," a major bond manager witnessed yesterday.
Because if the interest rates go down, the states will be even more troubled to reduce their debt, otherwise stabilize it.
The backup of the euro is at that price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government takes a round back
After an annoying start of the week for Italy, the situation slightly relieved yesterday, with the reflux of bond rates to 10 years.
Return to uncertain calm.
Upon a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "undiffictable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party later denied.
On Tuesday, the gap with the German long rates had reached a record of 210 base points and the price of the bankruptcy risk coverage (CDS) agreements had flown to 263 points, leading to a certain downturn in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was greater than 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "strong concerned" about "market turbulences" and a possible infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with, making the state run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italy’s growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget in review at the Senate tells up 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of the GDP next year (in comparison with 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
This is why the rumor of a new budget collective that could be established after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
“When necessary, new austerity measures will need to be taken,” Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
Italy is currently supported by international institutions.
“The foundations of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have repeated it for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate, short or long-term problem, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
It remains the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Representatives, following which anticipated elections could be held at the end of March.
It would then open a period unfavourable for decision-making in case of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
In a press conference in Paris, Christine Lagarde said: “Europeans, I think we have shown it again on Sunday day and night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone.”
Despite all the relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the interest rates of European state bonds brought water to the government and the ECB's mould.
But we can’t talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could decrease Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted today by speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on the banking systems,” Exane BNP Paribas’ economists estimate.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers it entails, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen the already existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more widely, with their G20 counterparts go well.
This is also due to the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings in early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the outcome of non-conventional support measures to the countries of the euro area in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform extreme-oriented investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, he prepares the ground for it.
The first issuance of FESF securities is scheduled for the next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional IMF direct commitment.
The countries on the top, Portugal and Spain, on their own, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in terms of the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that add to closer-effect savings measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than those of Greece and Ireland.
Both sides want to avoid asking for international assistance before setting up their own budget corrections and deciding on structural reforms necessary to sustainably restore confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the sovereign bond markets.
By passing to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber had the first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to give the hand to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an approximately €100 billion extension would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with a total of €60 billion.
A council that has all the chances to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are worsening.
Snow and Glass: 24 departments in Orange Warning
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, on the secondary network in Britain, and are at risk of disturbing certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert due to the risk of snow and strawberries.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Two-Sevres and Vienna, added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, sustained snow aversions affect the north of Gironde and the Charentes and the island is weakly snowing.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, Meteo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned for heavy weights of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of need and the traffic of some TER cars was suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy weights.
The prefecture “invites all drivers to make the highest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly.”
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% to Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France gets full, the billions are raining.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, it is mentioned 23 billion dollars for the Metro Grand Paris that will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the state has announced a capital grant of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is that amount that will then allow the SGP to borrow from the markets a part of the financing of its double circle.
Now we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Rectificative Finance Act, examined in the National Assembly’s Financial Commission this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of that money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in France.
The first, according to the text of the draft law, article 15, is "in the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is cifrated: "The yield of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a reorganization of an office tax that already exists “to modernize it, increase its product and affect this increase to the Society of Grand Paris”.
How much would it report?
The mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
"These tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital grant that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Grand Paris Society in the course of the project," the statement said.
In the SGP, we don’t find this shocking system.
“From the moment when we create revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion afterwards,” it explains.
“It will be included in the budget and will be drawn up gradually.”
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion are still to absent subscribers, risks to trigger a slightly agitated parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Hackers revenge and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals itself a apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between the states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes internationally, and prefers a future dominated by recession.
Let’s proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi is owner), and Khadafi's caricatural profile was long for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret records should be composed only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts doesn’t like to do unpublished research (not know where to search for news about the inexistent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism only believe in what they already know, and which reaffirms what they’ve already learned.
This is Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
I go for the secret records.
The informator is lazy, and lazy (or mind-limited) the head of the secret services (or he could be, what I know, editor at Liberation), who retains as true only what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these records make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, i.e. that the ambassades, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of states can call themselves or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representation exercises, have turned into spying centers.
Any film spectator knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put the U.S. diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country brings a not negligible blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put victims as much in crisis as the “borreals”.
But let’s go to the deep nature of what has happened.
Once, in Orwell’s time, every power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been fully proved since, being able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now happening, that even power secrets can’t escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s revenge – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility to keep his own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is a empty secret (and empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means removing him all power.
WikiLeaks has not done any harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - this would be to publish it on a poster attached to the corner of the street.
But it is as obvious that with current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and reserved reports beined in the future?
I know well that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences on uncontrollable routes, being only carryers of messages learned by heart or, at least, hiding the rare information written in the hole of a shoe.
The information will be stored in a single copy in closed-to-key boxes: in the background, the attempt to spy the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology now advances in crabe, i.e. backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wireless telegraph (telephone).
The video cassettes (analogic) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and back and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travel it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not extraordinary that policy and communication techniques come back to horse cars.
The last observation.
Previously, the press sought to understand what was hidden in the secrets of the ambassades.
Now, the ambassades are asking for confidential information to the press.
Climate: How France Sweeps its Financing Promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it’s time to examine the fulfilment of promises of rapidly unlocked financing (the so-called fast-start or early financing) made by developed countries.
And the great French shadows are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (or €420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU made the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start financing: a detailed report on the action of its Member States, a press conference, a big side event, brochure distribution...
The transparency operation is valuable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has delivered €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right way to fulfill its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional efforts are made without being at the expense of the Public Development Aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits him.
For example, the European Commission has regarded 2009 as a reference year: international funding isined, and it adds 150 million over three years in the framework of fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of public development aid.
France, on the contrary, estimates that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous years or the overall level of Public Development Aid.
Concretely, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to “new and additional” financing.
Another key element is the distribution between donations and loans.
There is no rule and everyone chooses his way of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1 € borrowed is equivalent to 1 € given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (sometimes projects related to emission mitigation based on more efficient technologies), it is false to present an euro that will be recovered as equivalent to an euro that is given...
But France has only to do such a reasoning: it “respect” its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) – see the EU document to check by yourself.
It is the only country in the EU to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other countries) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers the effort comparable.
Beautiful passport tour!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double fraud: on the one hand on the evolution of action in time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, it can make it believed that it spends €420 million "new and additional" in consistency with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems good that it was Bercy who made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other Member States continue to give if it was enough to borrow?) and in negotiations since developing countries are not completely deceived...
The early financing chapter is just a small, relatively short-term issue, compared to all the climate discussions.
But it could be a more sand grain in the enormous machine that is the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to get the lessons from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But most importantly, France could advance the discussions on the long-term financing issues (an other crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or how to account for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would increase the level of international trust needed to advance in the discussions.
Pesticides consumed by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Future Generations (ex-Movement for the Rights and the Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results “do not have significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problematics treated,” bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and an incas in a day by a child of a decade, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as sweets, have been examined by laboratories searching for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or likely cancerogenic and five classified as certain cancerogenic as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
“While, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see well in our survey that the reality of consumers’ exposure to potentially cancer-genic contaminants and/or PE is worrying,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible cancerous residues and three proven to be certain cancerous as well as twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, which is imported from Brazil, has traces of six chemicals, one of which is forbidden in France.
The same for Kenya’s green beans, included in lunch, on which the study found traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak, the box tuna, and even the bread bag and the chewing gum were filled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the rubber the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chlorform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical remains detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this “contaminant cocktails” is “probably underestimated”, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-The Greens (EE-LV), on its side, proposed "face to the emergency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
