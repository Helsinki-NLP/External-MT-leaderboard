The Welsh AMs were concerned about 'looking like idiots'
There was a fear among some AMs that their position should be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It was brought about by the plans to change the name of the meeting of the Welsh Parliament.
AM fans through the political spectator were concerned that it might be called a joke.
One worker from the AM party said his team was concerned about "its twp and pwp sequence".
For audiences outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means "the tyrant" and pwp means "the filthy".
An AM member wearing a fur coat said the group as a whole was "not happy" and had suggested alternatives.
A Welsh moderate said their group was "open-minded" about changing the name, but that it was seen as a short verbal leap from the MWP to make us look stupid.
In this context, the Welsh pronounce the letter w as the English pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Meeting Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision of any narrator addressing the meeting members is indeed a matter for the members to the members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members the power to change their name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that found widespread support for calling Wales a parliament for the meeting.
In the case of the position of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or WMPs, although the MWP alternative received the most support in seeking public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternatives, but the efforts to reach agreement with the drafting official, Elin Jones, who is expected to present draft legislation on changes in a few weeks, could be a headache.
The reform regulations will include other changes to the way the meeting will function, including the rules on the incompetence of the AMs and the structure of the committee system.
The AMs will vote on the question of how they should be addressed when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece over its own state, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents an earthquake on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Sorin Saav, argue that the name change is merely the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
While churches in Harlem struggle, St. Martin's is silent.
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said that there was a barn and a church at every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, none of that".
He said that the invisibility of the stones could be understood.
"People are sociable in many ways", he said.
"The basement is no longer a lounge where people frequent the ground".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that "sooner or later they will return to where they started".
He added that the remaining churches could be replaced by apartment complexes with apartment buildings filled with people who are not supported.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartment complexes in these buildings will be white", he said, "so the day will come when all these churches will close together, because people who move into these apartment complexes cannot be expected to be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by the white religious congregation before Harlem became a black borough - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist church left in 1930.
The church, which was worshiping black people, took over the building.
The Black Religious Congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a strike of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that prevented black people from being hired or promoted, seized ownership of St. Martin's.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but the donors of Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it, and they implemented the Skull and Bones.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Fr Johnson and the successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the wolf "the poor man's wolf".
In July, an expert who played the game called it something different: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany A.G., an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first guitar in the world to be played by Dionysio A. Lind, a black musician who had moved to the largest organ in the Flood Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Mary Wether said that St. Martin had no one to replace him.
What has been happening at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complex myth of architects and contractors, some introduced by amateur church leaders, others by the Archbishop's office.
The Vestry - the governing body of the contributors - formed from amateur leaders, although not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the Bishop of Vestry, wrote to the Bishop in July expressing concern about "expectations of imposing costs" on Vestry.
Some contributors complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the Archbishop.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy who dives to catch a puffer fish in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for a shark in California on the opening day of the shark fishing season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in Santiago that he was diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then a team ran towards him to get him out of the water.
At first, he thought it was just the thrill of touching a peach, but then he realized that he was screaming, 'Bite me!'
I was bitten!
Hamel said that when he reached the boy, his entire spine was torn open and his neck was hit.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was airlifted to the Rade Children's Hospital in Santiago, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Although the lifeguard Captain Larry Giles had told a press conference a few weeks earlier that he had hit his neck, it was determined that he was not a dangerous shark.
Gilles added that the accident caused immediate damage to the upper crest of the Thanta.
Officials are closing access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Escinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Although there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most are not considered dangerous
Sainsbury's plans will propel the UK beauty market forward.
The Sainsbury's supermarket chain takes over the business of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, including the mall-style iconic store with a staff of expert assistants.
In a bid to give a significant boost to the growing beauty market of US £2.8m, as fashion and furniture sales continue to decline, 11 stores around the country, including large beauty stores, will be audited and, if successful, more stores will open next year.
The rise in cosmetics comes as supermarkets follow in the footsteps of the floor space utilization trajectories once used for TVs, microwaves and furniture.
Sainsbury's said it will double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 brands, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman Dr. PawPaw, for the first time.
From L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees to those found in stores like Boots, the brand will be able to offer more space with branded areas similar to existing ranges.
The supermarket is also re-launching its shopping layout to make more products more vegetarian-friendly, something that is more demanded by young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test selling discounted items at two stores in Sainsbury, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The shift towards online shopping and buying small amounts of food daily from a local convenience store means that supermarkets will have to do more to make people more flexible in their visit to their store.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the supermarket chain will look more like a mall as it tries to compete with discount establishments like Aldi and Lidlhas with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's, which bought both chains two years ago, has Argos stores selling its products in hundreds of outlets and has introduced a number of Habitats, which it says has helped retailers make acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts at the supermarket to modernize its beauty and pharmacy were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the company folded after a scandal over how its supermarkets shared revenues from pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
Lloyds said it would implement a feature of the design by adding an extended luxury leather trim line with La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands.
Paul Mills Hicks, marketing director at Sainsbury's supermarket chain, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our corners, including our image, to improve the environment for our customers.
Special assistants are also employed to provide guidance.
Our brand is designed to meet all needs, and the exciting environment and convenience of the spaces are an image-driven destination that we now have around us that challenges the old-fashioned way of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulls out of an £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones, TV presenter Holly Willoughby, and ITV were furious after pulling out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contract with Marks and Spencer.
Willoughby really doesn't have time for their furniture and accessories brand.
The couple's business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning news anchor used her Instagram account to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby's last-minute withdrawal from their luxury lifestyle brand campaign infuriated Dragons Den star Peter Jones - who had to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when she told him at a sensational meeting with the Golden Girl on TV at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she really didn't have time to devote to their furniture and accessories brand because of her new deal worth up to £1.5 million.
The business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was happy to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11.
Willoughby, 37, took to his Instagram account to announce that he had indeed left, and Jones left Britain by jet to go to one of his holiday homes.
"It was definitely Holly's top priority", said a source.
It was her long-term future that would see her through the next two centuries.
Her decision to withdraw completely shocked everyone involved.
As it was so close to launch, no one could believe what was happening on Tuesday.
"There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at Marlow HQ".
Experts believe the departure of the morning news anchor, one of Britain's top earning stars, could cost the company millions of pounds due to massive investment in a range of products from mattresses and candles to textiles and furniture and could further delay its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin Jones, have been close friends with his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are spending the holidays together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity, replacing Annette McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said last night that we're not commenting on his business dealings.
After a serious conversation, we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a statement that some consider too offensive to the president and being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so backward?
Trump said in his humorous "newscaster" voice.
"I have left nothing behind".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump sees as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have been called off.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not expect an "appropriate response" from the United States on its pre-emptive measures to disarm North Korea.
Instead, he said, the United States would continue to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the summit.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were preparing for war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing back the remains of American troops.
He defended his unusual approach when it came to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to get into this crowded theater, we'll keep about 200 here", Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake kill hundreds and devastate an island
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were no longer needed.
More than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, but no national disaster has been declared to call for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it is very clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is a bit challenging", said Sumbung Mu.
Save the Children is deploying a team to Palu, and it is not yet confirmed whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Indonesian officials are approaching Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts, said National Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo.
Given the frequent earthquakes Indonesia experiences, the country's preparedness for the onslaught of nature remains at a dismal low.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not common on other beaches.
Even if a warning is in effect, the absence of a tsunami warning system in Palu could cause loss of life.
In many seasons, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters complicate the transportation of goods.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok was heading to Palu to treat victims of the earthquake, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new tragedy.
Improving Indonesia's disrupted infrastructure was made a focus of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, which he financed with highways and railways.
But as Mr. Joko faces re-election next year, his administration is under pressure due to lack of funds.
Joko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more traditional form of faith.
Christian and Muslim gangs engaged in street fighting using sharp weapons, spears and arrows and other violent weapons, killing over 1,000 people and displacing tens of thousands from their homes.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturge, who is playing deep-lying versus Chelsea,
Daniel Sturge scored a goal against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, September 89, to save Liverpool from a Premier League defeat.
Sturge was offered the ball by Sheldon Sugary, 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, as his team trailed 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting the long pole.
As it moved toward the upper right corner of the net, the effort moved over the enclosure.
The ball finally fell over a jump by Kepa Arisbala and into the net.
"It was just trying to get to the point to get the ball and because players like Shark always play it as far forward as possible, I tried to create as much time as I could myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"Cante came forward and saw a floor being thrown, but he didn't think much of it".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the semi-final after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker made a return bid to Matteo Kovacic in that playoff round before spinning to Liverpool's half, spinning near midfield.
Kovacic made a quick pass and run in the midfield.
He then threw Hazard into the box, and made a beautiful throw.
Hazard overcame the safety measures and passed Alison Baker in Liverpool with a left foot shot and entered the net from a distance.
Liverpool and Napoli will play in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday in San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the Videotape team in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The total death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
The UN's spokesman, Sothopo Purvo Ngroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after Friday's 7.5 magnitude quake, which caused waves as high as 20 feet.
The city of Palo, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with ruins.
A 32-year-old man is arrested as a suspect in the murder of a woman after she was stabbed to death.
The woman's body was found this morning in Merseyside, Birkenhead, and a murder investigation has been launched.
The 44-year-old was found with a knife wound at 7:55 p.m. in the Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report any sightings or reports of any incidents.
Detective Inspector Brian Orgagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us".
I urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have anything recorded by dash cameras to contact us as they may have information that is essential to our investigation.'
The woman is confirmed to be a resident of Birkenhead and a police spokesman confirmed that her body was found in a property.
Friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene this morning to find out where she was found.
Police said that the immediate relatives of the victim are being informed and the investigation is ongoing.
Police say no one was allowed to enter or leave the building as a taxi driver from Grayson Mive attempted to re-enter his apartment.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
Residents are being told it will take hours for them to be allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling one person that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman stood there in tears.
'It's very dangerous,' she kept saying.
Around 2 p.m., two police vans were in the lounge and another van was outside.
Several officers were stationed in the lookout to monitor the blockade of the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to DM @MerPolCC, dial 101 or call Crime Prevention anonymously on 0800 555 111 on September 30 with a note 247.
The statue of Cromwell in the Parliament becomes the latest memorial in the 'Rewrite History' series.
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures by his extremist Puritan followers in the manner of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
Cromwell did not order or execute the destruction of statues during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed the work of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier.
Sir William Thornycroft's spectacular portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century view and a part of the historical record of a character many believe to be worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "More than today, in the late 19th century, Cromwell was seen by many as the protector of the dictatorship in Parliament against outside influences, in this case.
Whether it is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century certainly shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
"His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of commemoration".
The killer pig kills the Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found dead from a massive bloodshed near a pigsty in the market in Liupanshuei, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm in Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly came to the market with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs from the neighboring Yunnan province.
The next morning he was found dead by his cousin, and a door to the adjacent pigsty was found open.
He said there was a large male pig with horn blood in the pig cage.
According to the report, a 550-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, according to a forensic examination.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and bruised", said the nephew, nicknamed "Woo", as quoted by the Guian Evening News.
Yuan was shown on security camera entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
Police are gathering evidence at the scene and the pig was locked up separately to prevent another attack, a market manager told Evening News.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly in talks about compensation for his death.
There have been reports of pigs attacking humans, although rarely.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig had a Welsh farmer's wife yelling at him to drive the beast away from his tractor.
After a pig ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a catalyst.
They're very sporty.
They're cute, they're very attentive... and they're not trying to hurt you.
"You just have to take care of them", he said.
The storm Rosa has brought heavy rains to the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
By 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Rosa had developed into a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north by Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tropical cyclone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, deep tropical moisture will begin to push northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The approaching tropical moisture will interact with the tropics to create a widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches can also pose a risk of catastrophic flash floods, debris flows and desertification.
Deep tropical humidity, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona, reaches rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour for spots.
Rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches in the southwest, especially in Arizona.
The scattered nature of tropical rainfall can cause flash floods with rapidly declining conditions.
With the threat of tropical rainfall, walking into the desert becomes a highly risky and absurd undertaking.
Heavy rains can turn into raging rivers and thunderstorms can bring strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching cyclone will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
More than half an inch of rainfall could result, leading to a small debris flow and road sliding.
This is likely to be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical rain will begin to reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains spread more widely on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread in all four directions on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
The Arctic will cool and the United States will see a sharp temperature change in October, but the tropics will remain relatively warm.
This may cause large temperature variations over short distances.
Sunday is a prime example of the great temperature variations across the central United States.
There's a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and Des Moines, St. Louis and Iowa.
In the next few days, sustained summer heat will build up and try to expand again.
With a broad spread of the 80s from the southern plains to the northeastern regions, much of the central and eastern United States is expected to begin warming by October.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 80 degrees, 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates higher than average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his 1980s sexual assault accuser Christine Blasey Ford's stunning statement on Thursday was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued with the broadcasters' disruption of normal programming for a deal planned by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to hold a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had grabbed her at a high school party while she was drunk and tried to escape her clothes.
Kavanaugh enthusiastically testified that he was 100% sure it hadn't happened.
Nielsen reported that more than 20.4 million people are expected to watch it on Friday.
The average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC was calculated by the company.
Numbers for other networks that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And normally, the Nielsen Institute has some limitations on how many people are watching in their offices.
To give you an idea, it's the same audience size as a playoff game or an Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, which strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
The Nielsen Institute said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest after the trial was high.
The central character in Friday's drama was Flake.
After the office of the moderate Republicans issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning blaming protesters for climbing the elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He was cursed and watched on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"You have power where most women do not", he was told.
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing before the elevator was shut down.
With the Judiciary Committee due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for a full Senate vote, all cable and broadcast networks covered the event live for hours afterwards.
But Flake said he would only do so if he realized that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee next week, as minority Democrats demand.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with the Queen and several senators.
It was clear that the Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation, so Flake had the choice.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing a 'political game' on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining the nation's well-being.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In one of her front-page interviews, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should add each other's tariffs was "completely fraudulent".
Deacon Simpson, suspect in the death of LSU player, is arrested by police.
A suspect has been arrested for the fatal shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Simms.
Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Detien Simpson was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wade.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the attorney general.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Office of the Coroner's Office said in a preliminary report Friday that the death was due to gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that helped to secure the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement agencies for their "vigor and justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 athlete grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was devastated and shocked by Wade's death.
"You always worry about this", said Wade.
The volcano is spreading ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano due to the activity of the crater, which has reported 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The station was monitoring a series of collisions and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have been observing increased volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence elections
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, as thousands joined protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote.
Masked separatists detained by riot police attacked them with eggs and threw powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets often crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, the police used their baton poles to control the fight.
For more than hours, pro-independence groups faced trade union protesters who shouted "Let's not forget, let's not forgive", and "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid deemed illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated, tensions remain high in the pro-liberal region.
Although the majority of those opposed to secession voted in a boycott and the turnout was low, voters largely chose to remain independent.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured after police tried to stop voting during violent clashes at polling stations across the region last year.
Independent-leaning groups camped out Friday night to prevent a rally in support of the National Police.
The march continued, but was forced to go in a different direction.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy over being able to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite managing a crucial but sharp victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independent-liberal parties have struggled to hold on to power this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either being forcibly deported by Typo or held in custody awaiting trial for organising a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joann Puig, a 42-year-old technician who supports the police and records the protest on his phone, said the clash was caused by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressful", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression and repression of democratic values that we have seen in the Spanish parliament", he said.
London: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car hit a house in London.
The incident occurred at approximately 19:30 BST on Thursday at Ballinagard Crescent.
The damage was to the gates as well as the building, said undercover detective Bob Plemings.
The car could also be hit by a crossbow.
Menga's shot gives Livington a 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston F.C. secured the win.
The Livingston Phillies surprised the Rangers by promoting him to manager of the Ibrox club, for Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games.
Gary Holt's side tied with Hibernia's in second, and Dolly Manga's attack proved to be different.
Gerard's side will remain winless in the Premier League this season and will face pioneering Hearts, who are 8 points behind on Sunday.
Before that, Thursday in the Europa League, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna.
Meanwhile, the Livingston Pistons, who have extended their undefeated run to six games this season, are still enjoying defeat after head coach Holt replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses the chance against Blunt Visitors
Their directness caused the Rangers all kinds of problems and Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored.
Scott Robinson was successful, but his effort was drawn across the globe, and later Alan Lithgow was able to lead his effort extensively after sliding across the globe to meet Craig Halcott's advance.
Knowing that their spectacular style of play could embarrass guests, the hosts were satisfied to let the Rangers play in front of them.
The crucial sphere was found.
The Rangers got a free-kick, and Livingston started, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Manga score a touchdown with a touchdown.
By that point, the Rangers had maintained their dominance but were unable to break the home plate defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely bothered.
Despite Alfredo Morelos's forced save from Kelly, the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman's shot was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's foot, and Lithgow again hit wide with a typical Livingston style of play.
Cross-strikes continued into the Livingston box, which were consistently avoided and two penalty requests - one for a touch with the ball and one for Halcutt's challenge in the case of substitute Glenn Middleton - were dropped.
The 'Miracle' of Livingston - A Review of the Story
Alyssa Lamont of BBC Scotland from Tony McCarthy Stadium
The miraculous performance and result of Livingston.
For a man, they are the greatest who has surpassed expectations on this journey to the top.
Their style and personalities have not changed since their return to the top, but Holt deserves credit for how strong the team has become since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcutt was a man of infinite strength who provided a superbly organized guard, and kept Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell fully prepared.
However, the Ranger's enthusiasm was low.
As good as they were under Jared, they fell below those standards.
Their last chance to sink - they only managed to win the hosts once - was a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast on Saturday.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at renewing ties between NATO partners.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police offered security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from coming to the mosque, but a large number of supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - protested, condemning Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to accept him into the country.
These hateful protests reflect the duality of a visitor, hailed as a hero by some German Turks and denounced as a tyrant by others.
The motorcycle rider is killed in a car crash in Deptford, Germany.
A cyclist has been killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car was stopped and paramedics arrived, but he died on the spot.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist ran off on Childs Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Police said officers are working to identify the man and alert his next of kin.
Roadblocks and buses are being diverted and vehicle owners are advised to avoid the area.
Six officers injured in the Long Larting Prison
The Bureau of Prisons said six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison.
The situation is alarming at HMP Long Larting, Worcestershire, at 09:30 BST and continues.
Special Tornado officers have been called in to deal with the unrest, which includes eight detainees in one unit.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "HMP Long Lartin has deployed specially trained prison staff to deal with an ongoing incident.
Six crew members are being treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and will spend a long time in prison.
HMP Long Larting houses over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
Riot police were called to the prison in October last year to quell a serious riot caused by the pool ball attacks on staff.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to rapidly flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (may be good for drought-affected areas)
Arizona is rarely subject to a tropical depression, but it is likely to happen early next week due to the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa, which is chasing through the southwest desert, posing the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The pink storm with rainfall on Monday is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only 10 tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm or depression status!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest National Hurricane Center forecast predicts up to 6 inches of isolated rainfall in Mogollon Rim, Arizona, and 2 to 4 inches of rainfall.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Plains, can be found with isolated combinations up to 4 inches to 1 to 2 inches.
The rainfall from Hurricane Rosa is a blessing to areas that are not at risk of flooding, as those areas are affected by drought.
While flooding is a serious problem, this report will be helpful for some areas, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Survey, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought, the second-largest category, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa is heading for the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Moving at 85 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds Sunday morning, Rosa is still a hurricane, moving north at 12 miles per hour from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, 385 miles south.
The storm encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific, and therefore its power is reduced.
So, we expect a tropical storm to submerge Mexico late Monday or early evening.
Heavy rainfall is expected in some areas of Mexico, with significant flooding.
Rainfall is expected to be 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a potential of up to 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will follow as a tropical depression before trailing through Mexico as a tropical storm early Tuesday morning before reaching the Arizona border, then moving south through Arizona late Tuesday night.
"The main threat from Hurricane Rosa and its remnants is expected to be extreme rainfall in the northwest coast of Baja California and the southwestern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause immediate flooding and loss of life, as well as desertification and loss of mountain land.
Four people arrested for attempted murder in the mid-summer Norton attack
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The young man was found wounded at the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He's been hospitalized, where he's in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials are asking anyone with cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says the Democratic Party's Kavanaugh is "suffering, humiliated, angry"
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and unkind tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that throughout his nomination process, Kavanaugh has endured the "defeat and anger" of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, quickly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually abused her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford testified at the trial in her case.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm a lawyer with the most gifted legal minds of our time, with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
Speaking about the importance of voting in the Republican wakeup call in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetimes.
I didn't, but I was really running, he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that Democrats were engaged in a "resistance and disruption" operation.
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first major Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on or before Friday.
The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds, and the toll is rising.
At least 384 people have died in a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and many more have been swept away by a giant wave that has washed ashore, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu on Friday, killing many and destroying everything on the spot, when waves as high as six metres (18 feet) hit the beach in the evening.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach without leaving immediately and they became victims", said Sutopo Pervo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Reduction Agency, at a conference in Jakarta.
Noting that the tsunami had come across the open ocean at 800 kilometres per hour (497 mph) before hitting the shore, Nugroho said, "The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, badges, houses and it hit everything on land".
He said some people survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges crumbled and a mosque surrounded by water.
Saturday, the coastal city was hit by a series of aftershocks.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The force released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II, according to a statement by Indonesia's Assessment and Technology Application Agency (BPPT).
It says that the city's geographical location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have magnified the magnitude of the tsunami.
The damage was "extensive", with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, Nugroho said.
He said several bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
The casualties and damage could increase along the coast in the area known as Donggala, 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, near the epicenter of the quake, Ngroho said.
Communications from Donggala have "been completely inactive without any information", said Ngroho.
The Red Cross said in a statement that the area is home to more than 300,000 people and that staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse", it said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not alerting Palu to a tsunami, but officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
According to an amateur video circulating on social media, a man on the top floor of a building was able to hear warnings of the approaching tsunami from people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water will collapse onto the shore, taking buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the sighting immediately.
The power outages caused by the earthquake and tsunami disrupted communications around the bridge, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military, with the help of Jakarta and other cities, has begun sending cargo planes, officials say, but the rescued still need food and other basic facilities.
The city's airport has reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the detention centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of tsunamis in Indonesia will exceed 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision staff have arrived safely in Palu City, while employees are staying in wax tents set up in their office yard, and have seen devastated scenes along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
It's very bad.
Despite the efforts of aid groups to launch relief efforts, some have accused highly skilled foreign aid workers of being prevented from reaching Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can only begin to be received if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It's never happened before.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Olia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"Well, we can open up to international assistance once the government says this is a national disaster, but there is no such situation yet".
As the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami dawns in Palo, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be miracles that will ferment dark tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was picked up in a garbage dump.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days, next to the body of her mother.
Two paragliders trained for the Asian Games, which were launched by Indonesia's national paragliding team coach Jendon Subandono, are missing.
The other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel are Mr. Mandagi and his students.
"As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional setback", he said.
Mr. Jendon recalled how he had been hard at work sending WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who were attending the beach festival, within hours of news of the Roa Roa Hotel break-in spreading among the paragliding community.
The result of his messages was not a pair of blue marks, but a gray mark.
"I think the idea is that there are no messages", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from a cash machine in Newport, La.,
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, $26,750 was stolen from a Brink's employee who was depositing money into an ATM in Levy, Newport, on Friday morning.
The driver of the car is clearing an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to add more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was there, another man ran after Brynx's servant and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the statement said the police did not give a precise count.
Anyone with identification information should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to "Y".
Announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The man officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Somewhere, and released his eighth album, Moniker, in June.
The change will come before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandy.
The show's creator said he would be replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons".
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word is of religious significance to him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning 'you,'" West said earlier this year, speaking to Big Boy Radio about the title of his new album.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is about us.
It was a can, a single person, that became a yes - a reflection of all our good, bad, complexity.
This album is a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the many rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P.D.D., or D.D., was the most popular name for this year, preferring Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who worked with West, also has a name with or without a capital letter.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the 50th anniversary of the bloody counterattack against students approaches.
Last Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America, the military attacked a peaceful protest in the square, killing about 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has promised to create a favorable environment for young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that youth are attracted to criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence.
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, says the United States should double the amount spent on research in this area as China shows more activity in artificial intelligence.
The comments came after announcements from various parts of the US government about artificial intelligence (AI) and the fact that the US does not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan: they aim to become the number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Dupling the budget for AI research will provide a good start, as all other countries are far behind the United States, and we expect the next rapid leap in artificial intelligence", Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that with the doubling of funding, the next big AI breakthrough will also double the likelihood of occurring in the United States.
Lee, the author of "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, China's most powerful artificial intelligence company.
He was an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China division, and he developed an artificial intelligence system that beat top-ranked American athlete, Ohlone, at Carnegie Mellon University in 1980.
The US government has previously welcomed technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when such a competition would be held again to identify visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the United States would have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that is taking the leaders out, it's the companies", Lee said.
Recently, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been recruiting university professors to work on artificial intelligence.
Changes to immigration policy will also help strengthen U.S. AI efforts, Lee said.
"I think people with PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically be given green cards", he said.
The State Council of China released their next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Ethnological Natural Science Foundation, in a similar way to the way that researchers in the United States are funded by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, fund individuals in educational institutions, but the quality of education in China is poor, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which intends to include industry partners and scholars. The White House also announced the formation of an AI Select Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's investing $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation, which currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been reported in months regarding the proposed U.S. law creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name from the "Republic of North Macedonia" as a measure to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece over EU and NATO membership.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, which is also the name of its northeastern neighbor, was denied entry into NATO and the European Union, saying it represented a claim to its territory.
Although the two states reached an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, nationalist opponents argued that such a name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and doubts have been raised over whether the referendum will achieve the minimum 50 percent required to be valid in the face of strikes.
The referendum said: "Do you accept the agreement with Greece and wish to join NATO and the European Union?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Savaev, argue that it is a fair price to pay for Macedonia, a state that emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia, to join institutions like the European Union and NATO.
I am here today to vote for the future of the country on behalf of the young generation of Macedonia, so that they can join the EU and live in freedom, which will make us all safer", said Olivera Jorijevka, 79, of Skopje.
While not legally binding, the results of the vote are still a matter of decision, according to a number of MPs.
To change the name, we need a two-thirds majority in the House.
The state election commission said that no irregularities were reported as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent voted, compared to 34 per cent so far.
62-year-old Josie Tanewski, a voter in the city of Skopje, said that because all children came to vote, we should belong to Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Sorica and son Dushko, voted in Strumnica on 30 September 2018 in a referendum on changing Macedonia's name to open the door to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kvarderkov was setting up a small stage and chairs in front of the tents set up by the referendum strikers.
"We want to join NATO and the EU, but not through the back door", said Kyzerkov, holding his head up.
We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they can't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian alignment.
Prime Minister Saif said NATO membership would provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will agree with this, because more than 80 percent of our citizens favor the EU and NATO", Saif said in his vote.
He said that the answer to the question "Yes" would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed voter turnout between 30 and 43 percent, which is below the required level.
A poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 percent of respondents were ready to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, it needs a turnout of 50 percent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major blow to the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is traveling through the shields of Brighton to pick up a ball
In a 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, and it was an unusually easy goal.
At the start of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received the ball in the midfield.
He runs through Brighton's guards and follows them into the open.
Then Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed one guard before passing a few of the last guards at Fort Brighton.
Then he looked at Sterling and moved the ball to his left.
Sterling touched the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and sent the ball to the right of the net with his right foot.
Aguero is suffering from a leg problem, City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's got a pupil at that point.
But the first win in the Premier League was for Sky Blue.
The sphere arrived at the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero got the ball in the middle of the area in Brighton.
LeRoy passed the ball to the left of Sunny.
Sunny touched the ball several times before Sterling was sent to a remote spot.
Sky Blue threw the ball into the net, not out.
On Tuesday, the Champions League match between Rhein Neckar and Hoffenheim will be played at the Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Shurzer needs to play hard to win against the Rockies.
The Nationals stopped the game against each other, so there was no need to give another start.
But the ever-competitive Shurzer is looking to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, and that's only if the Rockies respond one level higher than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies are still trying to win the division title, despite a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night.
Even if we don't win this year, it's important to know the situation in Denver with the crowd, and playing with the best team can prepare us for any situation.
So there's no reason not to compete.
The National Team will make a formal announcement on Sunday, but Scherzer has reportedly been given the opportunity to comment.
Scherzer, making his 34th start, had been training prior to Thursday and will normally have his day off on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding waves in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly commented on the situation with his choice for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
Everything we've done is being questioned in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lifetimes.
This is the biggest one we have, -- I'm not just running this, it's very important, because I'm looking for the best candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see these destructive radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They're trying hard to get back to power somehow, you see the humiliation, the alienation.
They don't care who they hurt, they'll do anything to get power and control, that's all they want, power and control, we won't give it to them.
The Democrats are trying to push us back by doing the opposite, he said.
"You've seen it for the last four days", he adds, "and he calls the Democrats angry, mean, disgusting, and hypocritical".
When he mentioned the name of Dean Feinstein, a top Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, there was a strong reaction from the House.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you print the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, there was a very bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a party that listens to everyone.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinions.
It's no surprise that party activists in my area voted to ban me.
I was one of the many who heard that I was no longer welcome in the party because of the actual expression of opinion.
My fellow congressman, John Ryan, was treated the same way because he stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship measure was taken because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy opposed previous leaders on the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and many other issues.
The announcement for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting said: "We want to make the meetings interactive and productive".
In my eight years as a Labour MP, all the Friday committee meetings have gone on like this.
Unfortunately, that was not the case today, and the promise of a more compassionate, more moderate politics was long forgotten.
A growing intolerance of the diverse views of the Labour Party was being displayed, and every opinion was being questioned as to whether it was acceptable to the party leadership.
This started a few days after Jeremy became the leader, and someone who I thought shared the same political views as colleagues gathered to demand a complete reversal of my politics and a different patriotic stance, whether it was on national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I spoke in public - no matter what I said - I was repeatedly attacked on social media, with claims that I should be removed and that I should no longer be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the accusations and opinions against me are purely political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who have faced numerous sexual or racial abuse but never recovered.
One of the most frustrating features of this political era is the normalization of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that a culture of tolerance must be built within the party.
The truth is that we are no longer a party that listens to everyone, and with every "no-confidence motion" or change in electoral law, the party gets narrower.
For the past two years, I've been told to keep my head down, not to talk so much, and that everything would be okay.
But I didn't come to politics to do that.
Thirty-two years ago, as my sprawling school classroom was decaying due to Thatcher's neglect, I worked as a local councillor or minister of state to provide decent public services to the most needy people since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has expressed any ambiguity about my policy positions and my objections to the existing leadership.
To all those who supported Friday's motion, I have to say that I don't understand why I waste so much time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader, at a time when we are leading the country towards a Brexit that is damaging to our homes, businesses and public services.
But in fact, my only message is not to the Nottingham Power but to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of dismissal or political advantage will stop me from acting on what I believe is necessary for your good.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Air 38-17, Melrose, the undefeated Air is up.
Two attempts were made to alter the final result, but the victory of this remarkable Tennants Premiership was undoubtedly justified by Air.
Now they're on top and the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was their high-pitched defense and their exploitation of opportunities that brought them to this point, and their coach, Peter Murcie, should be pleased.
"We have been tested in many matches but we have not lost, so I should be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "The Air Force deserves credit, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did".
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's shot was replaced by Frazier Climo and Ayr came forward, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggett to make a successful attempt.
Climo led the Aers with five penalties and scored before halftime, turning a single try to make it 17-5 at halftime.
But the Melrose started the second round well and were down to five points by Patrick Anderson, who was stopped by Baggett.
A serious accident then befell Ruvid Notte, who was taken to the ambulance, which halted the race for a long time, and after a restart, Ayer continued with the efforts of Stafford McDowell, who was turned by Climo.
The interim captain of the Air Force, Blair McPherson, was then given a yellow card, where the Melrose team was under intense pressure to reverse the efforts of Bruce Colvin.
However, McPherson returned to the A's when Climo's tackling in the absence of the ball gave Stuven Hutchison a yellow card.
After the restart, Kyle Rowe took a boxer shot from David Armstrong, and Gregor Henry's attempt was reversed.
The Steel Game actor is set for a new career in the restaurant industry.
With the revelation that Steel Game actor Ford Kieran has been named director of a licensed restaurant company, he is set to take a job in the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old is writing the popular BBC series Jack Jeeves with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be their final and seemingly preparing for a new life after Kearnon, CraigLang.
Official records indicate he was the director of the Adriftmorne Company.
The Scottish Sun reported that Kearnon was looking to partner with another restaurant in Glasgow, but he declined to comment.
"The sea is ours": landlocked Bolivia hopes to reopen its path to the Pacific through the courts
The sailors visited the naval base at La Paz.
The flags of the government buildings are flown in the sea.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval headquarters are marked by the motto: "The seas are ours".
It is our responsibility to recover it.
For landlocked Bolivia, the coastline has become a mere memory as a result of a bloody resource conflict with Chile in the 19th century - but they are eager to sail back across the Pacific.
Decades later, these expectations culminated with the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the strength of unity and unity, and is hopeful of a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Celsadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country, and it is expected that the Hague tribunal - after decades of volatile negotiations - will do justice to Bolivia's demand that Chile agree to negotiate providing Bolivia with a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenously unpopular president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also at risk of a Monday decision.
"I'm close to going back to the Pacific", he said last August.
But some analysts suggest that the court is unlikely to reach a favorable decision for Bolivia - and that nothing will change much if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to award any territory to the Chechen people and cannot be held responsible for the outcome of any negotiations.
The ICC's decision comes six months after the final debate, which means the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The goal of Bolivia could have been achieved in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea is being addressed by the current Bolivian administration", Sarate said.
She noted that Morales's harsh speeches had eroded the good spirit that had prevailed in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will negotiate at some point, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez-Weltse, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily hasty.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to enter a new era of relations with Chile, ending 139 years of conflict and benefiting from each other", he said.
Moreover, Calsadilla denied that the maritime issue was being used for political gain, as Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, denied that the issue was being used for political gain.
"Bolivia will never renounce its claim to the Pacific", he said.
This decision is an opportunity to put the past behind us.
North Korea says it will not denuclearize until the United States is credible.
North Korean Foreign Minister Re Yong Ho says his country will never denuclearize if it cannot trust Washington.
Re, speaking at the UN General Assembly last Saturday, said:
He said the promises made at the Singapore summit between the two rival countries should be kept.
He made the remarks three months after the failed nuclear diplomatic talks with North Korean Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Re says that the challenge of continuing sanctions and protesting the declaration of the end of the Korean War to bring the North to its knees is only a dream.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration until it receives significant disengagement from Pyongyang.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump have called for a second summit.
However, Pyongyang's denial of the dump, which is believed to be the only way to ensure the country's security, has raised considerable suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion houses strongly suggest bringing a fancy hat to your doorstep.
If you want to increase your hat collection or block out the sun completely, now is your chance.
Valentino and Tom Brown added a crazy-sized line of headgear to their SS19 collection, which was a highlight of Paris Fashion Week.
The less practical hats were all over Instagram this summer, and the three designers brought eye-catching designs to the fashion scene.
Valentino's main design was a light brown feather-like wide-brimmed hat, which completely covered the model's head.
Other costumes, which were quite elaborate, included jewel-encrusted bracelets, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has a strange set of masks that will fit the upcoming Halloween season.
Many of the colored masks were lip-covered and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than of a classic design.
One design was like a scuba diving suit with snookles and goggles, and the other was like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're looking for a great fashion statement, you're in luck.
Fashion enthusiasts predict that these magnificent hats will be on your street.
The large hats came with the two-foot-wide straw hat, the Zala Bombard, which was visible everywhere from Rihanna to Emily Retzkowski.
The top end of the impractical, social media-crazed hat came with another design - a straw bag as big as a model in a swimsuit.
The burnt orange straw bag with a white leather handle was a highlight of Jacques La Rivera's SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity fashion designer Luke Armitage told Fimmel: "I expect bigger hats and beach bags to arrive next summer - the designer has made such an impact, the potential demand for more exquisite clothing cannot be ignored".
John Edward: The language monkey for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a record of academic excellence, with a strong track record in sports, arts, music and other community services, and continued to do so in 2018 with a host of other outstanding results.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) strives to provide the highest level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools are working on a pilot project to prepare their students for further and higher education, as well as their chosen careers and as global citizens.
We see modern languages as a subject that is becoming more popular and preferred in schools as a form of education that can be planned and implemented in a formal school curriculum.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak in a language that a person understands, what you say goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will be felt in his heart.
This shows us very well that when we want to maintain contact and gain trust with people in other countries, we cannot rely on English alone.
The latest exam results this year show that languages are at the forefront of independent schools with the highest pass rate.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages scored high.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored high in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, and 69 percent in French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an essential skill for children and young people in the future.
In the curriculum of independent schools as well as elsewhere, language is considered an elective subject on par with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 per cent of the difficulties entrepreneurs had in filling vacancies were linked to language skills deficiencies.
Language skills are therefore essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increasing number of jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming essential in the globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if you're learning a second language, having this kind of lifelong ability is very beneficial.
Being able to communicate directly with people in foreign countries will often put a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 UK adults found that 75 percent could not speak a foreign language with the ability to conduct a conversation, and 15 percent spoke only French as their second language.
That's why it's important to invest in language education for today's children.
Especially in developing countries, children who speak more than one language have a better chance of finding suitable jobs.
In Scotland, the language of instruction varies from school to school.
A number of schools will focus more on classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are considered to be important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Depending on your child's preferences, there may be a wide range of languages available in the independent schools, and specialised teachers will be employed to teach them.
Scottish Independent Schools is committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children for the future and equips them with the necessary skills.
In a global business environment, it is undeniable that languages are crucial for the future of a country, and these needs must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth community.
It had to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron starts his Lakers journey this Sunday in San Diego.
LeBron's opening game against the Los Angeles Lakers will mark the end of the long-standing presence of the game.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets against the Pilots in the opening game Sunday in San Diego.
But how long he'll play is still to be determined.
Walton told the Lakers' official website that it's going to be one more and 48 less.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will play a limited number of minutes.
James was asked about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule after practice earlier this week.
"I don't need a pre-match to prepare for the level I'm at in my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia Waves, the YouTube channel
President Trump begins his campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five planned waves for Trump over the next week, including stops in several friendly areas, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote to decide his choice to fill the enlargement vacancy was suspended and Trump is building support for the upcoming midterm elections as the November vote risks losing the Republicans power in Congress.
The time of Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online.
The rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube via the following link.
Meanwhile, Trump will speak about the temporary suspension of the Senate decision vote for about a week due to the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court on sexual assault charges.
But the main purpose of these heated meetings is to get the Republicans to rally for the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign says the five waves over the next week are aimed at strengthening volunteer members and supporters as Republicans seek to retain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.
As we move into a busy election campaign, control of Congress is very important to his agenda, so he will travel to as many states as possible, a campaign representative for Trump who declined to be named told Reuters.
Metro News in West Virginia will bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the rally, which will be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and will also receive Pittsburgh media coverage.
Saturday's visit to West Virginia, which won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016, is Trump's second trip there in the past month.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is heading to the polls with him.
Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters that the president's presence to help with the election was not a good sign for Morrissey.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is preparing for the Sunday match
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's four-man squad may be all it takes for the Ryder Cup.
The vertical momentum of a swing is a completely new concept in sports, but something that players rely heavily on, and this game is a perfect example of that.
Where are they now?
"They had a six-point goal, now it's four, so I think it's a bit of a momentum", said Jordan Speith.
With a four-point lead and 12 games to go, Europe is in a really good position.
As Smith says, the Americans have little wind to propel their sailboats, and they have much to encourage.
He played from T to Green with a great spirit and set an example for all.
The resulting great celebration continued throughout his playing career, and he scored on a par with Thomas.
He scored 15 points and then he pushed the ball, and the same noise went up, and it showed everyone that the American team was still in the game.
"You have to play the game, fear your own game", said Smith.
That's all these players have left now.
There are 18 holes to make it.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more than Spith and Thomas, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The beloved players of Europe are unlikely to be wrong.
The only couple who did not score more than one hit on Saturday evening was Bollywood, but they also missed Saturday's hits and played on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
Their strength was evident in the rising tide of the moment, as they realized that they were the only ones who could beat the others on Sunday, and that no one but Fleetwood or Molinari could win Europe at the LA Golf Nationals.
Often this will happen in other holes at the same time.
But it's too early to talk about the magnificence of Europe.
Baby Watson and Web Simpson made a quick farewell when the morning football hero Sergio Garcia paired with Alex Noren.
After one more attack than the scheduled number and a duel in the Front Nine, the Spaniard and the Swede fell into a difficult-to-recover pit.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help you.
Watching football and soccer matches up close is fascinating because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice given, the advice not given, and the instantaneous change in strategy.
So far, Europe has been playing well as a team, with a significant margin of points to the final day, but in these Fossam matches, the United States has shown a significant struggle.
Europe holds a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe is moving strongly into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead against the United States after Saturday's Football and Foursome matches.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari beat Tiger Woods in the National Championship to win two of the matches.
Thomas Bjorn's Europa team, determined to win the trophy they lost two years ago, scored a massive 3-1 defeat of the Americans in the morning football game.
In the Fossam, the USA team showed more resistance and won two matches, but they could not score less points.
Jim Furyk needs eight points in 12 singles matches on Saturday to win the trophy.
He was the first European to score four points in a row, and became the second pair in the history of the Molinari Ryder Cup to score four points in four opening games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Foosballs, Woods and the American Bryson DiCampo were defeated by another powerful 5 and 4.
Woods played two games on Saturday, but he had a good offense, losing 19 of his 29 games in football and soccer, including seven straight losses.
After a morning football break, Justin Rose joined his teammate for Fossam, Henrik Stenson, in a 2-1 loss to the world's No. 1 and No. 2 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopeka.
Europe did not get what it wanted in this pleasant, windy region southwest of Paris.
Triple-time champions Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas beat the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against John Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and at Foursome, they beat Poulter and Rory McCroy 4-3 by losing both opening holes.
A team with four points less than the other was in the Ryder Cup tournament only twice, but Furyck needed a level playing field to win the trophy.
After two days of second best, Sunday looks set to go even further.
North Korea says it will never unilaterally undo without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sustained sanctions were increasing mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances his country would never unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
Speaking at the World Organization for Nuclear Research's annual general meeting, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken "considerable good measures" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, denuclearizing, and not increasing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any response from the United States", he said.
"We have no confidence in our national security without any confidence in the United States, and under no circumstances will we disarm it".
Re repeatedly stated that Washington's resistance to the "phased" approach to denuclearization and North Korea's complaints about the systematic measures taken there, made it clear that Pyongyang did not unilaterally reject unilateral denuclearization as it had done in the past.
At the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 2, he commented on the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, in which Kim pledged to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and Trump pledged to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea hopes to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang will give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also opposed the easing of sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States will be forced to disarm first and will be pressured to achieve its goal by force, even as sanctions are being imposed against the declaration of an end to the war", Re said.
The idea that we can be trapped by the media is a dream come true for those who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions increase our distrust.
Ri made no mention of the second Kim-Trump summit, which the UN was planning earlier this week.
Referring to meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the minister said: 'If the other party to this denuclearization was South Korea, not the United States, there would not be such a blockade on the Korean peninsula.'
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from his statement to the UN General Assembly last year, where he said that North Korean rockets would inevitably target US soil after "meaningless President Trump" said Kim was a suicide bomber.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea at the UN last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm this year, but said they had done so and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline and that it would take two, three, five years, no problem.
China and Russia say they deserve to be punished for Pyongyang's actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: 'The implementation of the Security Council sanctions will be very strict until we see that the unloading is complete, final and verifiable.'
Since 2006, the UN Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri during the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has made three trips to North Korea this year, the last of which was not so good.
He left Pyongyang in July, and despite making progress, North Korea accuses him of making demands similar to those of a murderer.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to remove a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding action".
Kim said the "corresponding measures" he hopes will be the confirmation of Trump's security pledge in Singapore and the normalization of relations with Washington.
Howard is teaching a course on rest.
As a culture of caffeinated nights of sleep for study grows, Harvard University has introduced a new course to help undergraduates get more sleep than they should.
One scientist found that students at the world's number one university have no idea about the basic issues of taking care of their health.
The course was designed by Charles Seisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it will be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep on learning.
One student came to me and asked, "Why did you tell me this in my senior year without telling me?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the value of sleep - which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
First launched this year, the course explains the basics of how adequate sleep affects academic and athletic performance, and teaches how to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after interviewing students who had been severely sleep deprived for a week.
This one-hour course will consist of a series of interactive tasks.
In one episode, a photo of a gymnasium where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of maintaining a sleep routine.
Another section explains how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, stress, and cancer.
There is a map of the university with interactive icons that guide participants as they think about their daily routines.
'We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know about the health benefits of smoking, as well as you, said Professor Seisler.
He says that the pride of the culture of studying overnight is still alive, and that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure indicate that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
He said that getting enough, quality sleep is a secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety -- and it's important to prevent weight gain, because when sleep is deprived, the brain is in a fasting state and it causes constant hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology in California, attended Professor Seisler's classes during his first year and helped him develop the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to make it a course offered throughout the university.
He hopes that the next step is for graduate students to complete a similar course of study before joining this competitive institution.
Professor Seisler recommends that students consider setting up a wake-up and sleep-wake alarm, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electrical screens and LEDs, which can disrupt your daily rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Menga's disciples are pulling Gerard's men down.
The Rangers faced another tough attack with Dolly Menga of Livingston beating Steven Gerrard's team 1-0.
The Bruins were looking to pick up their first win since their 4-1 win over St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team scored Gerard's second loss.
Menga scored with seven minutes to go, and the Rangers lined up without any shelter.
The Rangers will then drop to sixth and Livingston to third, trailing only the Hiberniaans in goal difference.
And the Rangers will be in more trouble after Calum Spence is sent to the stadium to be treated for a head injury sustained by an external impact.
Gerard had made eight changes to his squad as Ireland reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went ahead with the same Lee 11 and scored a goal from Hatts last week, and their well-dressed suit was a breath-taking shadow of all the other opponents.
Although the Rangers had the ball well, Livingston made good use of it.
Menga's first stop would have allowed them to score a point as Scott Pitman threw the ball into Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder took his chance.
Keegan Jacobs' free-kick reached Skipper Craig Halkett, and his defensive partner was able to only jump from the back.
The Rangers took control, but their game was more promising than trusting.
The Colombian refused to accept the referee's request, even though Morelos thought he should be given a penalty for the collision between Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lolas.
The Rangers can hit the goal in the first half, but they are not as challenged by the head-shot of former Irbox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, or the shot of Ovie Ezzaria.
In the 34th minute, it was obvious that Levi's opening shot was against the advantage, but no one can deny that they had it.
The Rangers were again unable to resist Jacob's attacks.
Scott Orfield was doing nothing when Declan Gallagher pointed the ball at Scott Robinson, and Menga was still for the final light hit.
Gerard Ryan replaced Kent with Coliballi, who was a good substitute, but was blocked by the poorly performing Kelly.
However, after a long period of pushing, Lithgow and Hulket failed to deliver the game to an eager crowd.
Holt could have increased the gap on his way to the final stage, but McGregor got up before Jacobs hit Lithgow with his head.
The Rangers' Glenn Middleton asked for another penalty, but Thompson refused.
The Geiger counter was invented by the German mathematician Friedrich Nietzsche.
Now a page from our Sunday morning newsletter: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, which later evolved into the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter became a staple of popular culture, as did the 1950s film The Bells of Coronado, starring two cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is this?
This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put the earphones on a pile, the radioactivity in the minerals makes the sound come from the atoms.
Yes, now it's going to explode!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his discovery will immortalize his name.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to detect dead cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect and kill dead cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells.
In this method, immune cells are taken from the patient and modified in a laboratory.
They can then see a protein that is common to most cancers and re-inject it.
The experimental vaccine is showing successful results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear after 18 months.
In this method, immune cells are taken from the patient, where they are modified in the lab to be visible for HER2, a protein common to most cancers, and then re-injected into the cells.
"Our results show that this vaccine can help us to build hope", said Professor J. Bersofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 leads to the development of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, pelvic, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Bersofsky.
They have also been successful in taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after the SNL show, will be wearing a hat and making a Trumpist comment.
It didn't go well.
After US President Donald Trump praised him for his 2020 candidacy, a backlash against Kennedy surged during a Saturday Night Live broadcast.
That night, wearing a Make America Great (MAGA) hat, he blasted Democrats and expressed his support for Trump after performing Ghost Town as the third song.
Every time I talk to a white person, they ask, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
"If I really thought about racism, I would have been out of the U.S. a long time ago", he said.
SNL began with a satirical script starring Matt Damon, which satirized the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on an allegation of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's outburst was not broadcast, it was promoted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if this post was made by Rock to mock West.
West also told his audience that his headgear had made him very difficult behind the scenes.
They mocked and harassed me behind the scenes.
They said you shouldn't wear your hat.
They hurt me!
Then they said I was in a position of failure, the Washington Examiner reported.
West continued: "Do you want to see failure? I can put my Superman logo on, but you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to see the world move forward?"
Try to love.
His remarks were echoed twice in the SNL auditorium, and members appeared to be in a state of distress, one of whom stated: "The entire auditorium was engulfed in a deep silence".
A few days ago, the late rapper Mac Miller came on as a backup singer to replace his girlfriend, Ariana Grande.
West posed as a bottle of Perry and performed "I Love It" to many.
Candace Turner, leader of the TPUSA Conservative group, tweeted in support of West: "Thank you to one of the most courageous souls: for standing up to the rioters".
But program director Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just acting like himself, which is really beautiful.
But I would never support someone I believe to be a detrimental ideologue to my community (by supporting his art or buying his music or clothes).
He's free.
"So do we", she said.
Before the show, the rapper announced that he had changed his name to Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he's following in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pee Dee.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince himself.
Charges of conspiracy to commit murder in the Belfast restaurant stabbing case.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following a stabbing incident at a restaurant in east Belfast last Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The actor of Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, is a vocal critic of the evil man.
Kit Harrington is the newest member of the cast of HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, John Snow.
But the 31-year-old actor speaks against the tradition of the tough hero and says that by showing such characters on screen, he is sending a message to young boys that tough must be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said something was wrong and questioned how to deal with the toxic issue of the pyramid in the #MeToo era.
Recently married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, Keith said he felt strongly about the need to deal with the situation.
I feel at this moment, personally and strongly, where we have gone wrong in our manhood", he said.
What did we teach the men who took up the subject as they grew up?
Kit argues that the more aggressive male characters on television are partly responsible for the rise of this toxic idea of masculinity.
He continued: "What is the society receiving, what is it teaching?
Through television and on the street, young boys learn that this is how we should develop to be men.
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
Because there's something clearly wrong with young boys.
In the interview, he admitted that he would not be participating in any pre- or post-Game of Thrones episodes that would end next summer, saying that his time with the battlefields and the seats was over.
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West, a drama about his brother, a film producer and thief.
He recently revealed that the best thing he's ever had from Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife here, and in a way, it gave me my future family and then my life", he said.
Rose played Yegrit, who won the love of John Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
China reports a 14% increase in new cases of HIV/AIDS.
China reports a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say there are more than 820,000 cases nationwide.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, indicating a different situation from the past.
Traditionally, in some parts of China, HIV is spread rapidly through infected blood transfusions.
But this way, HIV infection has been reduced to zero, a Chinese health official said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year by year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection has been a major problem among the gay, lesbian, and transgender community in China.
In 1997, China decriminalized homosexuality, but discrimination against homosexuals, heterosexuals, and transgender people remains widespread.
Studies estimate that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women because of the country's conservative values.
The most common cause of transmission is inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, as part of efforts to address the problem, the government has pledged to provide universal access to HIV treatment.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP released the information of the senator by a member of staff, inciting "dangerous misinformation" and "cultonic militant theories".
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted information on three Republican U.S. Senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that "extreme right-wing scholars and websites" were making the accusations.
Waters tweeted: "Muses, mice and very geopsychological mice".
The released information included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The release came shortly after three senators were questioned by Kev.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified as the source of these posts were linked to Waters' offices, and Hill reported that information from a member of Waters' staff had been leaked.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and untrue", Waters said.
The identity, personal information and security of a member of my staff has been compromised by these deceptive and false allegations, and the member is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and untrue.
Waters's statement quickly drew criticism online, with former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher commenting.
"This denial is outrageous", wrote Fleisher.
This shows she lacks the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone accuses someone else of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
They shouldn't protest.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and serene.
Fleisher Waters's reaction to Thursday's verdict was seen as a way of trying to reconcile the anger with the criticism of the accused, Judge Kenobi.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is trying to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his views.
"In fact, it's huge", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said she had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent allegations.
We will ensure that these criminals are quickly exposed, she said, and that they are regularly informed of their activities which are destructive and dangerous to anyone and everyone on my staff.
Johnny English Strike Again review - Rowan Atkinson, the powerless, treacherous spy
It is now common to refer to Brexit in any new British-themed film, including the return of the action-comedy series Johnny English, which began in 2003 as Johnny English and ended in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Does this satirical self-deprecating act show how unrealistic we are as a nation in a new export scenario?
The eye-catching, rubber-faced, mischievous Johnny English has been given a second license to do it all wrong - the main thing the name implies is that it is a wide-ranging comedy production designed for non-English-speaking film audiences.
He's actually a stupid detective with some of the faces of Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the man playing Charities of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in his bizarre disguise.
He is also based on the now-defunct Barclaycard television commercial, The Secret International Man and the Traveler, starring Atkinson.
There's one or two great moments in the latest Johnny English movie.
I love the scene where Johnny English walks into a helicopter in his medieval armor and the helicopter blades attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to present physical humor is well illustrated, but the humor is somewhat disempowering and exaggerated by the incorporation of the film 007 and Mission Impossible, which are considered to be serious films.
The satire here seems to be aimed more at children than adults, and I find the absurdities of Johnny English's ninety-nine errors not as creative and innovative as Atkinson's silent performance in Mr. Bean.
This timely example shows that Great Britain is now in a serious crisis.
A cyber-hacker breaks into a top-secret British intelligence network, reveals the identities of all British agents in the field, and causes a minor setback for Kevin Eldon, the fear of his on-duty agent.
It was the final straw for the then politically disenchanted and suffering from complete deviation, the satirical Prime Minister: this half-Theresa, played by Emma Thompson, is very well-acted, but she has little to do in the screenplay.
Her intelligence advisors say that since every spy has been captured, a retired spy should be brought in.
The person is employed as a schoolteacher in an important institution - but teaches how to operate stealthily - John English: Here are some examples of how English teaches espionage in a modern school.
An emergency call calls to English White Hall, where he reunites with his longtime partner, Bo (Ben Miller).
Now Bo is married and his wife is a high-ranking submarine commander.
The two go back to the Queen's Secret Service, where they meet the beautiful and sexy Ofelia Bulotova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is caught up in the arrest of a tech billionaire who claims to be the mastermind behind Britain's computer problem, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Beau begin their mystical journey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause a massive stir in Volta's luxury yacht, and try to use a virtual reality headset to gain insight into the interior of Volta's home, which turns into total anarchy.
It's a little bit of a children's show, but it's a little bit of a children's show.
Everything is normal.
And I thought about other Johnny English films: Couldn't the British film industry provide a character that matched Rowan Atkinson's talent and was fair to it?
The Labour Party is rejecting a plan to give British workers four days a week and five days in pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to give the British a four-day work week and a five-day pay.
The party reportedly wants the company owners to use the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution to give employees a day off.
The new law will allow workers to have three days off and to receive their current salary.
According to sources, this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a worker-friendly one.
The idea of a four-day workweek was introduced by the Trades Union Congress as a way to benefit workers in the face of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "We expect to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
It is not a one-day event, but it is in line with the party's strategy to rebalance the economy in a way that benefits the workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The idea was not first put forward by Labour, but by the Green Party, which pledged a four-day workweek in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole has not yet endorsed the initiative.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being taken into account by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who outlined his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy, at the Labour Conference last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to restore power from the faceless directors and beneficiaries of the subsidiary.
Another aspect of the Shadow Chancellor's plan is that the current shareholders of water companies will not have to return all their shares because of the "reductions" for misconduct.
He also outlined his plans to include employees on company boards and set up a cross-ownership fund to provide employees with 10 per cent of the private sector's gross profit, which amounts to an annual bribe of around £500.
Who will the FBI's investigation change his mind, Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells 60 Minutes
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether any Republican senators will withdraw their support in the face of the bureau's revelations.
As 60 Minutes airs Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might reveal something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think, really", said Kennedy.
I went to the trial and talked to the judge.
I called him after this happened, when this charge was made, I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was very firm, determined and very clear.
However, it seems unlikely that Graham's vote will be overturned.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, which will lead to a major indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Graham Christine Blasey, quoting Ford, said.
No one who named him could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't think anything will change.
What is the Global Citizen Effect, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, a thrilling annual superstar music festival with the ultimate goal of eradicating poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival marks its seventh year and thousands of people are drawn to the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the rides of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to advance awareness of the true purpose of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advisory group that hopes to increase the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the attendees have to do a series of tasks, or volunteer, send an email to a world leader, raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty, and engage in other meaningful activities.
But just 12 years away from reaching its goals, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been?
Is the idea of giving away free tickets to a concert a genuine way to get people to do something about it, or is it just another form of what's called clique activism where they think they're making a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizens Group says it has documented the actions of 19 million of its supporters on various causes.
These actions have led world leaders to announce policies and specific projects related to this goal, with a combined value of over $3 trillion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first half of 2018, the group showed that it had 390 projects and that at least $10 billion had been raised or spent through its activities.
The group says the funds raised have directly impacted more than 649 million people worldwide so far.
Among the most prominent projects is Power of Nutrition, a US-based investor partnership dedicated to helping children develop to their full potential, which has pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the injustice of pig feeding history", said Tracy Ullman, representative of Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group further said that after more than 5,000 such actions to motivate the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Nutrition project, which reaches 5 million women and children in need of nutrition interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen responded: "It's a long and difficult road - sometimes we can fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are some of the stars at this year's New York show, which will be hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use naval "barriers" to disrupt Russian energy exports, the interior minister said.
The Washington Examiner reveals that U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink said Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets including the Middle East if necessary.
Zinc accuses Russia's intervention in Syria at the invitation of the regular government of being a strategy for its exploration of new energy markets.
"The reason they're in the Middle East is because I believe they're energy-related, as they are in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
The officer has a way and a method to handle the situation.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to prevent their energy from reaching the market", he said.
Zink said this at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called Voice of Energy Consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, saying they were similar.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less leverage and fuel substitution", he said, noting that Russia is the only country that is economically dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration sought to expand its LNG exports to Russia, which has been the more profitable alternative for European customers so far.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to force Germany to withdraw from the ill-fated Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump believes will create a Berlin-Moscow complex.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is planned to increase the existing pipeline to a capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to the project is based purely on economic considerations and is an example of unfair competition.
"We all agree that energy should not be used as a tool of pressure, consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The move in the US has sparked strong opposition in Germany, which has since reiterated its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries, Germany's main industry body, has told the United States to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with third-party interference in our energy supply", said Dieterich Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries, after a recent meeting between German Ambassador Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think hard" about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she is "deeply considering" running for president after the upcoming midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was running for office at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it's important that a woman is at the top", she said, according to Hill.
I am seriously considering running for president after November 6th.
City Hall spokesman Warren spoke of President Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "We really need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a majority of Warren's own voters in a referendum on Thursday said she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said she should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of the voters supported it.
Former Governor Deval Patrick received the most support in the poll, with 38 percent voting in favor and 48 percent against.
Other top Democrats discussed as potential candidates for the 2020 presidential election included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
As reported by the Associated Press, he will make a decision in January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the rally of Donald Trump on the post-crisis state of Trump's track.
Trac Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night on a domestic violence charge.
The pain my son is suffering, the pain he is suffering after his return, is the same as other families suffering from the effects of post-depression stress, and our soldiers are coming with these wounded souls, he said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said of his arrest that it was "obvious but not up for discussion", and that her son, like other war veterans, "comes back with a different feeling, coming back with a hard heart, wondering if the service of their fellow soldiers and airmen, all other military members, to this country is being honored".
He was arrested in Vasillia, Alaska, on Monday on charges of violently assaulting a woman, possession of a weapon while intoxicated, and other charges, a Vasillia police spokesman said.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims fleeing group or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the District filed a court-appointed lawsuit in Washington, D.C., last Friday to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy.
The full name of the visitor was not disclosed during the session of the American Civil Liberties Union's filing of Grace v. Federal policy in August.
She said she was abused by her partner and her sons, members of a violent gang, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers supporting Grace described the large number of asylum seekers in the United States as people from El Salvador, Honora and Guatemala, which are rife with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who suffered from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Ruggins issued a statement Friday saying the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
"All claims for asylum under federal law must be determined by the specific facts and circumstances, and this violates that policy", the A.J. summary states.
Lawyers further argued that denying immigrants entry into the United States would harm the economy of the country, as immigrants often provide the labor needed for entrepreneurs and supplies.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to no longer provide remote shelter to victims seeking asylum due to domestic abuse and gang violence.
Those who leave their home country because of any form of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion may be granted asylum, Sessions said, announcing the policy on June 11.
The world's population is growing rapidly, and the number of people who are unable to afford health care is increasing.
With the death toll doubling, a very difficult rescue exercise is being launched in Palu to search for survivors.
The survivors have faced terrible conditions.
Reza Kusuma, 35, said she was "deeply stressed" as she comforted her fever-stricken child in an abandoned center in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulance's bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The inhabitants seem to be moving to their ruined homes, picking up their wet-weathered belongings, trying to rebuild everything they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the damage caused by this 7.5 magnitude earthquake is overwhelming hospitals.
Dewey Harris, who has a broken back and shoulder, and others who have been injured, are being treated outside the Palu Military Hospital for multiple post-concussion conditions.
He was in his fifth-floor hotel room with his wife and daughter, and his eyes filled with tears as he reflected on the devastating earthquake.
There was no time to save our lives.
I think I was trapped in broken walls, Harris told the Associated Press, they were in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "advertising fraud"
In a four-page ad in a U.S. daily, the Chinese Embassy in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid supplement to the Des Moines Register newspaper, which sells eggs in Iowa, alleging it was trying to interfere with the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections is a new phase in Washington's increasing efforts to pressure China, a US official told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, this is unique in that Beijing and China are currently engaged in an escalating trade war and have imposed a number of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and US experts say China's counter-taxes at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and long-time governor of Iowa, which exports agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a letter to the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China is now doubling down on the violence by advertising in our own free media.
"In the campaign, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and a free press by posting paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Bransted wrote.
"Here in Beijing, all media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, so you can't see any true representation of the Chinese people's views on China's troubled economic journey in the street papers", he wrote.
He also claimed that a major Chinese newspaper, though not named, had omitted to publish his article.
Analysts warn that with the coming extreme defeat, Republicans will isolate women in the midterm elections.
Analysts warn that they will be especially beaten back by women in the upcoming elections as many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple sexual assault charges.
The situation is very serious, and many Republicans have already declared that a referendum is needed.
"Nothing can be reversed", Granheuer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in a Saturday article.
Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Representative) opened the way for an FBI investigation at the last minute, but Rehner said he doubted whether it would be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and in November, said Caryn Jean Pierre, national spokeswoman and senior adviser for the Mov On initiative, on Friday, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, as Republicans took control of the court to proceed with the nomination, despite the testimony provided by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters protested outside the Senate chamber, shouting "November is coming".
"The enthusiasm of the Democrats is huge", said an unbiased political analyst, Steven Rothenberg, to a news website.
People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can go even higher, especially in suburban areas, where there is a high proportion of young people aged 18 to 29 who are not in a position to vote because they don't like the president.
Even before Ford made public the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said there could be some setbacks if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
This has been a shock to the Republican Party, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
This is not a matter of the committee vote or the final vote or who is being scrutinized, it's a matter of how the Republicans handled this and how they handled her, said Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic nominating group Priorities USA.
However, in the face of the evidence of Ford and Queno, most Americans are faced with the question of who to trust, regardless of who they are for.
A new poll from YouGov showed that 41 percent firmly or most often accepted Ford's evidence, and 35 percent firmly or most often believed no one.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kevon was often or permanently incorrect in his testimony, and 30 percent said that Ford was.
The Guardian also reported that at Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as those made by Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, on oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford said that she was 17 years old when someone influenced her intoxicated.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party he attended while teaching at Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a new Internet to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is developing Burners Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows its users to choose where they want their data stored and which information can be accessed by which person.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the idea of INRPT is to rule the world.
"We must do it now", he says of his origin.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online data warehouse, or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all being on the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal online database is that the user can completely choose which data can be accessed by which people.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea is to bring the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
At the moment the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, a community of contracted developers and volunteer coders to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the InRapt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change because their business models would all be turned upside down overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Saturday Medium, Berners-Lee states that the mission of Inert is to protect the authenticity and quality of the new web built on Solid, providing commercial energy and ecosystems on the Moon.
In 1994, Berners-Lee, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, completely transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent times, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
In addition to launching InRapt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and Open Data.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the web", said Berners-Lee.
The first world war is commemorated by the Victoria Cross Chapel.
The first bishop of the Diocese of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his service in the First World War has been commemorated in his hometown for nearly 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Bellinglis and Lehocot on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper attack, unaware that he had been awarded this highest British military honour.
His two grandchildren opened a memorial to him at the Battle Honours in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said the unveiling of the monument, 100 years after the battle that his ancestors won, was "very symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van was leading his troops through the Canal de Saint Quentin amid heavy fog and the sound of shelling and machine gun fire.
Then he ran to the firing line and, with heroic courage, single-handedly used a field gun to beat three battalions ahead.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper attack on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, says that he could never forgive his grandparents' actions, but they had a profound effect on us.
He and his brother Dr. James Van wore a bouquet of flowers after the procession, conducted by the Brettonwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said, "It was a great honor to be in the parade and the award to a brave and true hero was well displayed by a large crowd".
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 will get Pepa Pig instead.
Think about it, you've been up all night watching Ballerina 2016, and you finally know you're not going to see the main event.
The San Jose Tournament featured 13 fights, including six major tournaments, and was shown on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6pm, as Geagars Musase and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were thrilled by the simultaneous airing of Peppa Pig.
Some who had been sleeping for the match were disappointed.
One sports fan on Twitter called the switch to this children's cartoon "crazy joke".
Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, said in a statement that if programs that are available by Grade 6 are not suitable for children, it is a government regulation to switch to a children's program.
- I'm not the Pig.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker says he's planning to expand his schedule to include U.S. visitors in the future.
"Every time I think about reinvention, I think about how we can do something about it", said Cocker.
But it's their Sunday morning, 6:00 a.m., Sunday is our time, and I don't think we can do anything until their time on Monday.
But we're working on it.
After that game change, a number of messages were exchanged, none of which were friendly.
We're trying to fix it, but we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it's not, it's a government issue.
I can promise you it won't be the next time.
We're trying to keep it five games instead of six -- as we usually do -- we've tried to do this a little bit more for our fans, but it's unnecessary.
This is a sad situation.
Tom Dalí had a nightmarish feeling about sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says that his sexuality made him feel more dreamy than anyone else, but it inspired him to succeed.
He was 24 years old, and he said that he didn't realize that "everyone is not like me" until he went to high school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Disc, hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that being a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Dalí, who was involved in Laverne's first show as a different person, said that he felt he was less accepted as a child because it was not as socially acceptable as boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, feeling like a person who is less than others, feeling like a different person, is giving me the strength and the energy to succeed".
He said that he wanted to show that he was someone, so that when people finally found out about his sexuality, no one would be surprised.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a high-profile member of the gay, bisexual and transgender community and a spokesperson for it. He was used to urge other countries to decriminalize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he was blessed to be able to live openly, and he spoke openly to give others that same hope.
He described how he fell in love with a man who was a three-time world champion, and who, by the way, was a U.S. filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Dalí, who had a fight with the Oscar winner 20 years his senior, said that age gap was never a problem.
Having experienced so many things at such a young age - he competed in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died three years later - he said it was hard to find a peer with the same wins and losses.
In June, the couple had a son, Robert Black Daly, who said that the view was different.
"If you heard this last year, you would have said it was winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are many things worth more than a gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of a brain tumor.
His father never believed he was going to die, and one of his last requests was that if he got tickets to London in 2012, he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you weren't long enough to sit in the front row, Dad.
"I knew I could beat him the moment he stopped breathing and died", he said.
The following year, 2012, Dali won the bronze medal at the Olympics.
"I knew this was my lifelong dream - to swim in front of my country's people at the Olympics, it doesn't feel so good anymore", he said.
It was also the basis for his first song selection, Pride by Heather Small, and the feeling of the pain he felt on the Olympic field.
Desert Island Disc is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 AM.
Mickelson is out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday for a poor performance.
Phil Mickelson, the American, will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup, but will have to sit out to avoid turning it into a dismal moment.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th bi-annual game, was suspended from football and soccer games Saturday by captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of playing normally poorly in the United States, the five-time champion was out of the game, encouraging players to correct the cause of his pain.
At the peak of his career, the 48-year-old competitor, who was not particularly good at striking straight, was not in the best shape for the National Championship.
If this road doesn't put him too far behind, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, teaming up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
Mickelson's game will be crucial to give the Americans a warm start, four points behind in 12 singles matches.
Furyk did not trust this man because he had to do something else.
"He understood his task for today, so he patted me on the back, put his hand on my shoulder, and said he was ready for tomorrow", said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a very talented player who has done a lot for the team in the past and this week.
I never saw him play two games.
I was hoping for more, but with this mine, we thought this was the right thing to do.
He wanted to be there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances ever.
This may be his last time playing on the Ryder Cup field, which never matched his individual records.
Furyke said that Mickelson's presence has brought a sense of sophistication to the team, but he has won 18 and lost 20 and seven-and-a-half.
He's funny, he's ironic, he brings entertainment to others, and he's worth being in the group room", he explained.
Young players enjoy being with him, it's a pleasure to see.
He's giving us more than just the game.
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows that the gap between the big points is quickly disappearing.
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows that the gap between these points will be pushed to an untenable end throughout the season until the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The Danish played a five-point lead against the Americans at Valderama in 1997, with Steve Ballesteros's co-captain, and won by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We had a big gap in Valderrama on Friday and yesterday, and 10-6 on yesterday, and we lost in Brooklyn, and we won in Valderrama, and it was by a very small margin", said Broghorn.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that this is not the end.
You'll be in full swing tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get the scoreboard.
Our goal is to try and win this medal, and the goal remains that.
As Mavis said from the beginning, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but on the other side - we know very well that they are the greatest players in the world".
"I was so excited to see how a tough golf course played out", said Björn, "that I could not have done it on my own.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the day that individual talents come forward and do something different.
It's nice to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're alone, you're put to the ultimate test of your skills as a golfer.
That's the message you need to get to the players to make the best of you tomorrow.
Now, let your partner follow in your footsteps and he will do his best".
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to play well individually rather than as partners, with Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who scored three of the four points, not among them.
Furyk, who was a member of the winning team in Brooklyn before Europe eliminated the "Miracle of Medina", played on both sides of those finals.
In 1999, when captain Ben Crenshaw was asked how his athletes made it to the final, he replied, "I remember every word".
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'll want to go for the same fast start as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
As that speed moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We're going to adjust our pre-preparations accordingly and we're going to put the members in a style of competition that we feel, you know, we're going to try to do a miracle tomorrow".
Thomas was given the lead and the goal of taking on Rory McIlroy in the top half, and the other Europeans in the top half, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, respectively.
"I went ahead with this sequence with this group because I thought it covered everything", Björn said of his singles choices.
The new German battleship has been delayed
The German Navy's newest ship, which replaces the old Cold War-era battleship, was due to enter service in 2014, but due to faulty systems and rising costs, it will not be deployed until at least next year, local media report.
The entry into service of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class ships, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014, but post-delivery issues were a major hurdle to the project's completion.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class ships.
They have powerful artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as secret technologies such as radar, infrared and sonar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the newest vessels must be able to stay up to two years away from their original ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships, which allow Germany to project power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
When the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the unfortunate F125 made headlines last year.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back since it was delivered.
Although the reason for the return is not known, German media reported a number of serious "software and hardware flaws" that would make the warship unusable if deployed in a military operation.
The Baden-Württemberg class ships are controlled by 120 sailors, about half the crew of the older Bremen class ships, so software flaws are significant.
Also, the ship is surprisingly overloaded, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is expected to weigh twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, is becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached a huge amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion.
The issue of obtaining the latest vessels is particularly important given recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's security committee, admitted that the navy was indeed "going out of service".
The official said the problem has grown over time as older ships have been taken out of service but no new ones have been delivered.
He expressed regret that none of the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class would be able to join the navy.
The National Trust is listening in on the secret lives of the bows.
A new study in a Scottish Highland farm aims to reveal how the owl uses the landscape in its search for food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will observe the common and soprano pipestral, as well as the brown long-eared Dobbinton whale, in Inverway Park, West Riding.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the owls throughout the season.
Mobile surveys will also be carried out by NHS staff and volunteers using hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine how often the buffaloes are making noise and which species are doing what.
A habitat map and a report are then presented to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the bats and how they are used by each other's species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management tasks such as grassland design and how to maintain forests for owls and other related species.
The population of the bald eagle has declined significantly over the past century in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their roots and habitat loss.
Flies can also be caused by chemical treatments of paper and building materials, as well as attacks by pets, but can also be caused by wind and light.
The baboons are not truly blind.
However, their ruthless hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes at catching prey.
They use advanced acoustic-positioning technology to accurately detect spots and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the owls very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, bird inspections, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organisation established Scotland's first and only dedicated whale reserve at Treve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten whale species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says that the estate is the perfect habitat for them.
"We have a lot of space for the owls in Threw", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and good homes.
But there's still a lot to learn about the baboons, so what we're doing here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to improve".
He stresses the importance of checking for the presence of swans before any property maintenance, as unintentional killing of a single parent herd could kill 400 females and juveniles and wipe out the entire local population.
Baboons are protected animals, and it is illegal to kill, harm, disturb, or destroy their cranes.
The Scottish officer of the Whale Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Farrell, has been persuaded by the public to help.
She said: "We have so much to learn about our bats, and we don't know how their populations will develop for many of our species".
Lawyers are suing the German newspaper, and Ronaldo denies corruption allegations
Cristiano Ronaldo has referred to rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people using his name "wanted to promote themselves".
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
Portugal and Juventus Forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayoga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
A report in Der Spiegel on Friday alleged that he paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
In a live Instagram video, 33-year-old Ronaldo addressed his 142 million followers hours after the allegation, denouncing the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
"What they said today, fake news", the winner of the Ballon d'Or says five times to the camera.
"They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's not unusual.
They want to be famous enough to say my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm happy and everything is going well", the athlete said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns".
Lawyer Christian Shorts said the athlete "will be seeking compensation for moral damages in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which may be the most serious violation of privacy rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a residential unit of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her through the anus, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and claimed that he was "one percent" less than "99 percent" "a good man".
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was in a standard way.
Mayorka claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "concerned about feeling reprisals" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she is still shocked by the alleged incident and is now trying to cancel the settlement.
Ronaldo was set to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident, and moved to Italian giants Juventus this summer for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will always be worried' about loss of carmakers
If the UK loses its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, the UK "will regret it forever", said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He also said it was "remarkable" that the UK's Toyota told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend production at its factory in Barnston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at borders would increase labor costs if a no-deal Brexit occurs.
The Bernaston plant, which produces the Oris and Aventis in Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"If Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, I think we will see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota's Barnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about a no-deal exit from the EU over how trade is done across borders.
For example, BMW says that they will close their factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The key point of what the automakers are saying is the supply chain risk of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "real-time" basis, receiving parts from suppliers in both the UK and EU every 37 minutes for cars that are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, according to the industry, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota will not be able to keep stock of more than a day's worth of goods at its Derbyshire plant, which will halt production, the company said.
Theresa May's chaining plan for future relations with the EU was "specially calibrated to stop those bricks at the border", Mr. Clark said.
"We need a deal, and I say we want to make the best deal that not only allows us to enjoy the success of the moment but also allows us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota, and other manufacturers, is that we must be able to sustain what has been a very successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how soon production would stop, but warned that the additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and ultimately increase labor costs.
Peter Tzowallari, who has worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is the union organizer for the factory's United Trade Union, said his members were increasingly worried: "In my experience these jobs are not coming back once they're lost.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
The White House says that the meeting between Rosenstein and Trump may be delayed again.
The crucial meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein "was delayed by another week" as the battle against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, ties between Trump's supporters and Russia, and the president's potential for obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Mueller's independence has been a matter of speculation in Washington for months.
Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment, the New York Times reported earlier this month.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that he would meet with Trump at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want" to turn Rosenstein away, but later postponed the meeting to avoid interfering with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, further delaying a full Senate vote, Trump ordered an FBI investigation of a week into charges against Kavanaugh.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There is no date set, it could be this week, and I saw it as a push back of another week for everything else that happens at the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I always like to keep the press informed".
Some reporters objected to the statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
"Why?" asked host Chris Wallace.
Sanders said that the media conference was not short of displeasure with the TV reporters "having a big attraction", adding: "I don't agree with the fact that they are being glorified".
She then suggested that there would be more direct meetings between Trump and the media.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, without citing evidence, adding: "We've counted them".
The press conference continues, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the president of the United States, it would be much better than talking to me".
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do it so many times over the last few weeks, and it's going to be like a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with potential guests.
Single press conferences are rarely held.
The president will explain to the reporters gathered in New York this week why his behavior is free and sometimes absurd.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude to the country and wish them to remain there after Brexit.
Jean Freeman has sent MSP a letter saying the UK has less than six months to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its assigned public services.
In her letter, Ms. Priman said: "In the summer, discussions on the withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and we are working to reach the desired decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also accelerating its preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their ethnicity.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise to strengthen and improve healthcare functions that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay".
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee's Mike O'Gane reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie suffered a head injury and underwent emergency surgery after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
The accident occurred shortly before the half-time, Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters.
"He came over the line and there was some kind of a fall", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff kept Abercrombie on oxygen before he was taken to the hospital for further analysis.
An official with the Tennessee State Team told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that the surgery at Abercrombie Vanderbilt Medical Center was complete.
"There is no information yet on the type/size of the injury", Harris said, adding that the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Redshirt amateur Auburn Rumbi is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before he was out of the game, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers are charged a high stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when purchasing property in the UK, with the extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme.
This action will neutralize Corbin's mission to attract young voters.
In the UK, tax evasion will be charged with increased stamp duty.
The Treasury expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and that the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The process will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to target younger voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target the high-income segment.
The stamp duty increase will be charged to non-taxpaying individuals and entities in the UK, and the extra money will encourage government action to combat slumber.
The surcharge on top of the current stamp duty is likely to be around three percent, the same high levels introduced for second homes and rentals two years ago.
The Treasury expects this operation to generate £120 million a year.
The rising prices of newly built London properties have seen 13 per cent of them bought by non-UK residents, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" as more foreign buyers often spend time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty for the younger community to own their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of plundering land and keeping property prices high, and urged her to abandon quotas for affordable housing to address Britain's "housing crisis".
Mr. Corbin has proposed a series of radical housing reforms, including ending rent controls and "flawless" evictions.
He also wants to give churches more power to build new homes.
She said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
It means stabilizing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for non-UK residents and foreign-sourced companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of many people of owning a home is far from being realized, and the scandal of sleeping rough is becoming reality".
'My only hope is to manage Scotland.'
Sunderland's captain, Jack Ross, says his "only hope" is to become manager of Scotland to some degree.
The 42-year-old Scott is currently challenging the club to revive the North East club, who are third in League One.
St Mirren moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking the team to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I got a B cap for it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I watched the Scottish team in the Hamptons a lot with my father when I was a kid, and that always drew me back.
I'm going to get that opportunity if I succeed in social management".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Cano.
The former head of the sport at Iowa says he has no fear of leading a name in such a well-established community, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I would measure success at this moment by asking myself, 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
"The club's structure and facilities make it definitely in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I can only see myself as successful if I can bring the community back".
After a stint as assistant principal at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hart, Ross has only spent three years as manager.
He later helped Alloa return from relegation to the third tier, and the following season transformed St Mirren from near relegation to championship winners.
Ross says he feels better than he ever did playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was a real milestone", he recalled of receiving Aloha.
"I honestly believed that management was more for me than sports.
It seemed amazing because I did the right thing, and it gave me a fair way to live, and it gave me a fair level of benefits.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you must accomplish each week.
I still do them when there's stress and pressure at work, but management feels like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to manage, and now that I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable experience I've ever had in my entire adult life".

The summer heat wave is drawing more people into Britain's busy pubs, but will put more pressure on the restaurant chain.
Sales of bars and restaurants increased by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant sales fell by 4.8 percent, the data showed.
Peter Martin of CGA, the business consultancy that compiled the statistics, said: "The continued sunshine and the longer than expected time for England to participate in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month, June, with pub sales up 2.8 per cent and restaurants hitting even higher.
The restaurant sales in June fell 1.8 percent, worse than in July.
The business of restaurants has declined, and the activity of liquor stores and bars has increased.
The sun has also affected restaurants that serve food, although not as much as those that run restaurants.
It shows that people go out to drink.
Sales in managed restaurants and bars rose 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales fell 3 percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since April.
The most important factors in out-of-home sales are weather and the impact of major social or sporting events.
With a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales particularly hard on the ongoing cost pressures, it is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle.
The long hot summer hasn't been the worst for the catering industry, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the space we need".
Overall sales growth for restaurants and cafes, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand exposure.

Elid Doyle will become the "voice of the sport" of the Scottish Athletic Association.
Elyd Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Governors.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Baty described this as a great opportunity for the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Elid has a great reputation among the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we firmly believe that bringing her on board will have a huge benefit for Scottish athletics", Battie said.
"I am keen to act as a voice for the players and I believe I can really contribute to driving the sport in Scotland", said Doyle.
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, is now a regular on the BBC and has been left unable to walk due to an equine epilepsy.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago on a day like today.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover or to what extent.
It was a very tiring task, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and am now exercising my mobility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump company has posted online ads comparing mothers and cows, and a variety of opinions have surfaced on the Internet.
A breast pump company has distributed online advice with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of what is being called the "world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company LV released an advertisement featuring a mocking music video demonstrating the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance from a haystack full of cows to a song that includes the following lyrics: "Yes, I drink milk, but you can't see a tail" and "If you didn't know these boobs weren't slimy, they're my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump, pump, I give them to the children, pump, pump, I'll steal from my women".
However, the announcement on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it undermines the "insatiability" of the dairy industry.
"It is a poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"Their babies are stolen from them within days of birth, and they must be conceived and born for milk production, just as we are", one wrote.
The LV breast pump fits perfectly into a breast-feeding tube (LV/mother)
Another commented: "It is understandable that both mother and child feel uncomfortable.
But why don't they use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who have to keep their babies with them?"
Another said: "It's such a stupid ad".
Others defended the ad, and one woman stated that she found the song "ridiculous".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'll have one while I'm still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad sounds a little crazy, but I get the point.
"This is a clever product", wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny advertisement, targeting mothers who breast-feed (often in their workplaces or toilets) and who think they're "babies".
This is not a commercial that praises or judges the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women shows them all dancing with this ingenious pump in their chest.
The idea behind this ad is that most women who breastfeed feel like cows.
However, the Elvy pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and fits perfectly into a nursing position, allowing women to move around, hold their babies, and move around while pumping.
Anna Balerin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "The LV pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and socially shocking introduction.
By announcing the drawing of a parallel line between women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the unique sense of freedom that the new pump would provide in a fun and detailed way, and to highlight the breastfeeding and all the challenges that come with it.
This is not the first time that the Elvish pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two modeled for fashion designer Martha Jakubovsky using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly taken to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has risen sharply as a result of the harsh policies and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult to place children with sponsors, even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively constant.
Traditionally, many sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that offering to have a child would threaten their ability to stay in the country.
The risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other elderly members of their household would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of orphaned minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or members of the sponsors' homes are staying in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminals who have fled the country.
"We're going to keep tracking them", Mr. Albans said.
In an effort to get the children in order faster, officials introduced new rules that, according to detention center employees, require some of them to be detained within a month of appearing in court instead of 60 days after the previous standard was passed.
Many people will appear to an immigration judge to request legal status for their case, not in person, but via videoconference.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
The more time children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent riots or escape attempts, according to detention center workers and reports emerging from the process in recent months.
Counselors said the problems were exacerbated in a larger area such as Tornillo, where a child is unlikely to show signs of confusion due to its size.
They said that taking children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends could complicate the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish 'remaining forces'
The war in the country is now in its eighth year, but Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ullam has called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, urging the UN General Assembly.
Foreign forces were illegally present on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism, and "will continue to work towards that", said Maullam, who also serves as deputy prime minister.
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions", he told the General Assembly.
More than 360,000 people have been killed and millions more displaced since 2011, and Maullam stressed that the "war on terrorism" in Syria is almost over.
He said that the state of Damascus would continue this holy fight until it had "eliminated all terrorists and illegal foreign residences from Syrian territory".
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
There are over 1,000 French troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Maulaim said that the situation was good enough for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that had driven refugees to leave.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these benefits", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any reform aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in the former rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for further political talks, UN ambassadors say.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Maulaim stressed that the agreement had a "clear timeline", and expressed confidence that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to the "defunct" al-Qaeda organization.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Maullam, who said the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the text of the current constitution", set conditions for the committee's participants on behalf of the Syrian government and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
If his presidency is not ended prematurely by the slander and stigma that many liberals hope for, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020.
It will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
At this point, there is no sign of visitors being tired.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and on MSNBC it has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.

And watching Bob Woodward use "deep background" as the source for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 Austrian-leather bomb jacket ("a teasing suit", the Washington Post said), and a six-hour panel discussion of Storm Daniel's use of the Trump bill's horrific description, you're beyond the average gay man.

Foreign currency flows into the most intense midterm election race.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th District has seen a cash flow thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district that elected two leaders from the same race to the same seat.
The measure recently recalled Democratic Representative Connor Lamb of suburban Pittsburgh, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th, another incumbent.
The maps were redrawn in January after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally set in favor of Republicans.
The new 17-man race has been a campaign finance finger-point between the main party's financial army, the Democratic Business Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Propaganda Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which many had been watching.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The Democrats have been pushed to the edge by political pundits.
The amount of penalties for El Salvador for supporting China has been reversed.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama have already accepted Beijing with a slight backlash from Washington.
Trump had a warm conversation with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and ran a hotel in Panama until his partners fired the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines against El Salvador amounted to only an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed fines, including cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a severe impact on the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were taking place, a similar meeting, which appeared to be a step forward in efforts to prevent immigration to the United States, postponed a high-level conference by North American and Central American officials aimed at security and economic prosperity.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted to proceed with the conference, effectively ending any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to address the mid-October summit in a sign of announcing the administrative locations for the meeting.
Meanwhile, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington, three US ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, and agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
An external analyst close to the administration confirmed their accounts and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's obstruction of justice may be the next shot, and there is now significant evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress is transferred, Mr. Trump is prepared to return to the electorate and to a jury of his peers, and he will be held accountable for the organization.
There are a number of possible outcomes, and I don't mean to suggest that the downfall of Mr. Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and that will affect how long the struggle can last.
Only if the West stood against him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich, in 1938 German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to prevent years of murders.
The course of history revolves around such precise points, and the inevitable progress of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a series of these tests.
What if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a dangerous situation since this article reported last year that he proposed secret recordings of the president's conversations and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is inaccurate.
"What would we do if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
Above all, should we vote in the midterm for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be dormant for a long time.

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the rapid Vienna conflict.
After an impressive win against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday with a win against the Austrians, putting them in a strong position to qualify for Europa League Group G.
A knee injury ruled midfielder Graham Dorrance out of his first appearance of the season, which saw him draw 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a benchmark to move on to higher levels.
"Villarreal is a good team, and it was good for us", said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game believing we could get something and came back with something.
Maybe we could have gotten it in the end, but overall, no victory was a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
By Thursday, it will be another great European night.
Hopefully, we can score three points, but it will be a tough game because of their good results in the final, but with the team behind us, I believe we can go ahead and get a good result.
With everything that happened with my injury and the changes that happened in the community, there's a factor that last year was definitely very difficult, but now it feels good.
The team is good, the players are really enjoying it, the training is good.
Hopefully, after the last tournament, we can move on and succeed".
The women are not sleeping because of this retirement savings.
Although the survey respondents had a clear idea of how to care for themselves, few had discussed it with family members.
Nearly half of the people in the Nationwide study said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to negotiate", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
We should start here.
Talk to your partner or children: If you do not inform your family in advance, you cannot be provided with a place to stay.
Since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost, work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you should receive care.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid monetary value life insurance policy that helps cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own money as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts.
Keep a health care record, so that you will appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes when you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider getting a power of attorney for your money.
A trusted person will be appointed to make financial decisions for you and make sure that you pay your bills if you are unable to do so.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disruption of communications has prevented relief workers from receiving any information from the Donggala area, north of Palu, near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some highlights about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a region stretching over 300 kilometres (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
The administrative region is sub-provincial, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific earthquake risk zone and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province in eastern Sumatra, Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits the southern coast of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jayas region of Aceh, causing devastation and terror by reminding the public of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami disaster.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: More than 500 people were killed in a major earthquake on the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily destitute.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been arrested on charges of assaulting a track-padded horse.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Riders, the 29-year-old Palin, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, a woman known to report alleged crimes tried to call the police, but he took her phone.
Paul is being held at the Matt-Suu Pre-trial Complex on a $500 unsecured bond, KTU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was questioned and told he was "certainly not guilty", the network reported.
Palin faces three felony counts in that class, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also sentenced to one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Supreme Court.
He was charged in January 2016 with domestic assault, interfering with domestic violence reporting and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by extremist groups for linking her son's violent behavior to a PTSD condition caused by serving in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people have died in a major earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Thousands of homes have been destroyed by the tsunami caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Power and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu City for a celebration when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the rare death sentence for the suspect in the NYC terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, the rare sentence in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Zypov, 30, is accused of using a rented home depot truck to submerge pedestrians and cyclists on the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway in October to attack a bike path.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors would need to prove that Szipow "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the death penalty motion filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both counts are capable of imposing the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter, a practice commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime trials, and the violent and destructive use of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", and the prosecutors described the way in which Zypov carried it out as "violent, brutal and disgraceful".
"Saifulo Habillevich Saipov has caused pain and damage to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Lore Decadente, Darren Drake, Ariel Arledge, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnuko", the ad stated.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time a trial in the Southern District of New York sentenced a man to death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal trial in New York was handed down in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Zaypov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he told investigators that what he did was right.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of theft.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the decision in the complaint.
"We think that the decision to plead guilty to a life sentence without the possibility of parole rather than accept the death penalty will cause a long-term shock to all involved", Patten said.
The defendants were previously asked by the bodyguard of Saipov not to seek the death penalty.
MP Tory says Brexit negotiations should be left to Nigel Farage
At a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage threatened to "lead the People's Army forward" today.
The former Iranian leader said that politicians should feel the 'warmth' of the Eurosceptics - and Theresa suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bourne told a march in Birmingham that the UK would have 'gone out' by now if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the Raceman Tory has highlighted the challenge facing the lady in reaching a compromise on her long-divided positions by joining a separate protest against Brexit.
Amid Brexiters, savers and the EU's attacks, the Prime Minister is trying to keep her "Iron Deal" plan in place.
Allies were adamant that she would go ahead, despite the hesitation, to reach an agreement with Brussels and force the EU opposition and Labour to choose between her package and the 'neighbourhood situation'.
Mr. Bonn, speaking at a Live Means Live rally in Solihull, said he wanted to 'cut the bricks.'
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a person of the summit and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had become a trustee, we would have been gone by now", he said.
The Welsh MP from Wellingborough also said: 'I am in favour of Brexit but we have to cut the bricks.'
He said: 'We did not fight for surrender in the world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people want to change their minds and stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins also attended the march, telling reporters: 'I simply say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The incitement is not popular among the general public, and the opposition does not expect to vote for it, and indeed it is not popular among our party and our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
Please stop whining and start listening.'
In a letter addressed to this lady, she stated: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs by keeping their promises.'
If politicians are ready to betray the decision of the 2016 referendum, they should be prepared to 'feel the heat,' Mr. Faraj said at the rally.
"It's about building trust between us now - the people and our political class", he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to show the warmth of our political class on the brink of brexit betrayal.
The people's army of this country, which gave us victory in Brexit, will continue to push us forward and will never let us go until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those willing to stay marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have been Tory-led against the Brexit banner since the group launched this weekend.
Labour's contemporary Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they faced in a party statement at the start of the convention.
"These are the people who are telling us that we can implement unhindered IT systems for borderless duty-free trade in Ireland and all technology for Canada", he said.
It was a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he said.
Warren plans to focus on running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was "very focused on running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Republican spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican GOP Rep. Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been moderate in speculation that she will run against Trump in 2020.
The ceremony in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting using the city council level since Trump took office.
A person present asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded by saying that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest office".
Simsj is arrested for shooting and killing at LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the person in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed in the early hours of Friday morning near Southern University.
According to 247Sports, "Wedid Sims was ultimately killed as a result of a gunshot wound to the head", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday.
Wade was shot by Simpson while trying to protect his friend.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to possession of a weapon and involvement in the shooting of Shotday Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was turned over to the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: The World Championship is coming to a close after teams order Lewis Hamilton to award the victory to Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes would play a big role in the team order match.
From the end, Bottas made a good start, defending his place in the first two rounds, and allowing Hamilton to score no points, inviting Wettle to launch an attack on his teammate.
Wettle was the first to act in a manner that was likely decisive, prompting Hamilton to run after the team.
Mercedes came back a lap later behind Vettel but Hamilton took the lead after a tight race, and the Ferrari driver saw this unwillingly, leaving the risk of two passes to keep the inside free and secure third place.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then stayed in the race to get a quick finish and to overtake Kimi Ryokan for fourth place, leading for a large part of the race.
He finally made it into the race on lap 44, but he was unable to improve the pace for the remaining eight laps, and Ryckkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, and Valtteri did a great job all weekend and told me to let go like a real gentleman.
"The team has done such an extraordinary job to get one second", said Hamilton.
It's really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally Saturday for not leaking a letter from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh alleging sexual harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed people to be "bad and evil and false".
"One of the things that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, and the beautiful thing that's happening, is that when you look at the anger, you see people who are angry and humiliated and mean and lying", he said.
"When you look at the exits and exits, they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release it?
Remember her answer... did you print the documents?
Oh, no. I'm not going to.
I didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
"We did... no, we didn't", he continued in the style of a senator.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein describing the charges against Kavanaugh, which left in early September - but Feinstein denied that it left her office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not publish her speech", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret".
But her refusal didn't seem to fit well with the president's comments during Saturday night's rally: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she's not, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen".
Advocating for the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
"They are making a decision to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the humiliation, the displeasure, who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control, they don't care", the president's statement reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Giants 5-3
Pant Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars won the replay 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday, and were granted amnesty for their Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants on Friday.
The Giants opened the scoring with a two-goal lead by the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowanie raised the level of the hosts before Dwyer recovered the gap with the Giants.
Lucas Lundwald Nielson defeated François Bouchard Dundee before securing his victory by two goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's players, who were on the trail of a 2-1 defeat to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams in the series, with the Giants winning all three games.
Boulier doubled the gap four minutes earlier, and at 3:35 a.m., Dwyer's starting pitcher David Rutherford, backed by Kendall McFaul, took the field.
During a busy opening period, Sullivan turned the game back to the hosts at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt Cooney became the co-host at 15:16.
When Dwyer scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period, he made sure the Giants were ahead of the first break.
The hosts regrouped and Butchard again brought it down with a power play ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Neilson lead Dundee for the first time late in the second period, and he secured the victory with his team's fifth-half in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The flight controller, who was responsible for ensuring the survival of hundreds of passengers, dies.
An Indonesian air traffic controller who died trying to ensure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people is being hailed as a hero.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continues to be affected by the strong aftershocks, with many people trapped in the rubble of Palu city.
While his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gwan Agung refused to give up his job at the heavily jumping control tower at the Siss Al-Jufri airport in Palu, Mutyar.
He was waiting to confirm that Flight 6321 of the Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safe to take off.
Then he jumped from the control tower, thinking it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
The decision could save hundreds of lives, Indonesian Air Operations spokesman Johannes Sireit said, ABC News reported in Australia.
We have arranged for a helicopter from Baliqpan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pulu.
"It broke our hearts to know this", he continued.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited, and officials fear the death toll could reach thousands.
"Many bodies are still in ruins and many are inaccessible, so the number is believed to rise further", said agency spokesman Sothopo Purvo Ngroho.
Waves rising to six meters have devastated the city, leading to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in dead bodies", said Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, to Sky News.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is making efforts to help the survivors, but we don't know what the outcome will be.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse".
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia visited Palu on Sunday and told the Indonesian military: "I ask you to work day and night to finish all the work that is involved in the rescue.
"The first day of the week, the first day of the week, the first day of the week, the first day of the week, the first day of the week, the first day of the week, the first day of the month, the first day of the month, the first day of the month, the first day of the month, the first day of the month, the first day of the month, the last day of the month, the last day of the month, the last day of the month, the last day of the month, the last day of the month, the month of the year, the month of the year, the month of the year, the month of the year, the year of the year, the year of the year.
More than 550 people died in the earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, earlier this year.
One person has now been reported missing in a plane crash in the lagoon, says Nyugini Airlines.
The airline that operated a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia earlier said it had rescued 47 people and crew safely from the sinking, but now says one person is missing.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that it was not responsible for the death of one male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information, such as the age or nationality of the passenger.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Seven people were taken to hospital, officials said Friday.
As of Saturday, six passengers remain in hospital, all of whom are in good condition, the airline said.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The Air Force and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in a swamp near the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane failed to target the runway.
The plane came very low, said Bill Janes, an American pilot.
"It was a very good thing", said Janes.
Janes said that he and others were able to walk in the water up to the chest to the emergency gate of the sinking ship.
He said the flight attendants were terrified and screaming and had minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a steamer helped bring people ashore using a wind-powered boat before the ship sank 30 meters (100 feet) in water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered aircraft over the past two decades, but nothing has happened to Air Nu Fire.
A nighttime timeline of women being burned alive is compiled by an analyst.
The complaint made its case in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to merge parts of the journeys of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Contrary to his earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported that he had received location data from several cell phones that showed she was with Telles Chambers the evening of her death.
Police went to call Sanford when data showed his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford arrived at the station on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked whether Telles' claim that he was in Sanford's truck that night was true, Sanford said, "My truck was in Nashville, so what he's saying is a lie".
Another discrepancy is that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Roulette said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telles may have deleted Chambers's text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The final hearing is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
It takes a hip-hop trio to fill their music with positive messages and challenge the negative view of the genre.
The Bristol-based band High Breed says hip-hop is trying to address social issues away from its political roots.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akalla and Loki.
Another black man?
A babysitter in New York sues a couple for eviction after a "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discrimination after receiving a false text message from her mother claiming to be "another black man".
The couple denied they were racists, describing the case as "a robbery".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was devastated to learn that she was black when she first arrived on the job in 2016 as the new child care provider Giselle Morris.
"No more black, pappapapapa", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, "concerned" by her late mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, citing a poor performance by an African-American childcare provider who was leaving the job and hoped she would be a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was paid for her one-day service and then sent home by Uber taxi.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, claiming compensation of $350 a day for the six months she was originally hired without a contract.
"I know it's discrimination", she told the Post on Pride, "I want to show them that it's something they shouldn't do".
The couple responded to accusations that they were racist, saying that they could have done better to fire Morris, fearing that they would no longer trust her after her conviction.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who was rude to you, even if you were wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Look at this".
Describing the case as "a money-laundering", Plasco said his wife had been out of work for nearly two months after the birth of her child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?
"It's not a very good thing to do", the investment banker added.
The legal case is still pending, and the People's Court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not care if a talking bear
The book was published in the United States in the year 1926, and it was published in the United States in the year 1928. The book was published in the United States in the year 1926.
It's interesting to know what we know about Paddington's tremendous success".
Her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book about a little toy bear, called the 60th anniversary of the book's publication "a messy one" after his death last year, saying he would have regretted the rejection of his work.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "the most important member of our family", she said her father was quietly proud of his success at last.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not a boastful man", she said.
"But because Paddington was such a special person to him, it's completely like having a child that you can accomplish something with: it's not something you actually did, but you're proud of them.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
"Despite his creativity and imagination, he always paid homage to Paddington".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was admitted to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life, though without any effect.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad and that she could not be expected to recover", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperos.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And then I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be right with you.
The medication doctors had given her to work her heart was slowly being released from her system.
She was dead a while ago, and this was the end of it.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all about to unfold.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to put up with it".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperos, who was mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the gravity of her situation.
"No one knew", she said.
"I kept my head down, and tears flowed from my eyes the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt this overwhelming sadness for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Grief-stricken women post cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries have posted messages of comfort and cards with phone numbers where people can call for help on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression from the age of 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to suffer the way I do", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a man with a smile on his face and aspired to be a chef.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would light up any room".
However, he was "in a place of utter darkness" and abandoned his work before his death.
In 2014, Tyler's then 11-year-old brother committed suicide to find his brother.
"I am constantly concerned about the continuing fate of this woman", said Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis designed the cards to let people know that there are people you can talk to, even about a friend.
"Do not be silent - you must speak".
Humphries, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt a mental breakdown or depression or anything", she said.
"We noticed a change in his attitude a few days before Christmas.
He was very down on Christmas Day - he didn't look at their faces or do anything else when the children opened their presents".
She said his death was a big shock to them, but they needed to bear it: "It caused a rift in the family.
It'll pull us apart.
But we all need to keep fighting".

As the FBI begins its investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future remains in the balance.
"I thought, if we could get something like what he actually asked for - a time-limited, scope-limited investigation - we could get a little or no agreement", Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared a "breakdown" of the committee during a strong partisan lockdown.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was almost entirely due to time.
With the midterm elections on November 6 just five weeks away - and if the Republicans do badly as expected, their efforts to elect the person they want to the nation's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has received phone calls to tell Senators in the House to ask them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush at the White House and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will be voted on.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and be elected to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of refugees in North Korea is 'dropping'
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, Park Byung-seok said 1,127 displacements occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
The main reasons for this, Mr. Park said, were the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high fees charged by human traffickers.
The Pyongyang administration has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of those from the North are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Many flee through the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is more easily crossed, and China, which has the longest border with North Korea.
China treats the perpetrators as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
The leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang earlier this month for the ground-breaking talks on the suspension of nuclear disarmament.
This came after the historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, who agreed to a comprehensive agreement for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But then, the Korean Foreign Minister, Rye Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there can be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm first", Mr. Reid said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune event in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't control it, but imagine if a woman ever behaved like that they wouldn't call her 'crazy,'" Pelosi said Thursday, referring to her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kawano was very emotional, and at times he was close to screaming and choking while discussing his family and his high school days.
He also openly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's been disqualified by those statements and the way the Clintons and Democrats have been chased", she said.
Pelosi expressed his suspicions when asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was found guilty and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, I say he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court, not just the court he's on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that since he was considered a moderate judge, she was also concerned about Kavanaugh's affordable housing bill or the possibility of a trial against Roy Wade as a Democrat.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"This is not the time for a crazy, biased person to go to court and expect us to read 'isn't it cool?'" said Pelosi.
And women should be able to control it.
It's a good criticism that has sown months and years of anger, and she can't get it without mourning.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "A woman who was a CEO somewhere and who helped me a lot told me that she invented a technique to tell the person she was talking to that she was crying because of grief when she was angry, but when she was crying because of grief, you could think that I was crying because of grief".
I'm mad at you".
Then she moved on.
And I thought it was great".
They are basically misidentified, so tears have been given space as a way to express anger.
One of the most vivid memories of my previous job is of working in a male-dominated office, and crying inexpressibly angry, I grabbed a fat woman, a shy manager whom I had always been a little afraid of, by the neck and dragged her down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will be happy to put you in that position".
Patricia Shorter, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a monogamous affair on the Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, deeply disappointed, Mrs. Shorter realized there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they wanted was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign was already overdue, and she was in the middle of a fundraiser, so she vowed not to enter the contest unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, raising money and what she did to the system that made it harder to target voters than representatives, and her breath-holding anger at sex - that she felt was not enough to make her feel safe.
"You might think I was devastated", recalled Mrs. Schroeder, "and the media's reaction to her".
"You might think that Clinix is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my grave?"
"She cried?"
How can a U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing's rule?
Experts say that the initial outburst of the US-China trade war was deafening, and that a dispute between the two countries, far from over, could benefit Beijing's rule in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The tariffs, which affect half of all goods coming into the United States from China, have hit a significant turnaround this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods.
Beijing has been hit with repeated retaliation, most recently by a five to 10 percent tax on $60 million worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to follow the US's lead, and the world's second-largest economy is not ready to leave anytime soon.
Washington's retreat means fulfilling demands, but publicly bowing to the United States is a disgrace to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the U.S. trade war pressure could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could trigger an economic collapse in both countries is actually more dangerous than those who are waiting for it were previously aware of", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank focused on Asia.
Syrian Foreign Minister says 'ready' for refugee return
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moullam told the UN General Assembly that the situation in the country was improving.
"Thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation in the country is more stable and secure today", he said.
The government is continuing with rehabilitation efforts to restore areas devastated by terrorists.
The refugees who were forced to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods are now in all conditions to return voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still remain in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'ullam said the Syrian regime appreciated the support for the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had sponsored the rebellion.
Europe is confirmed as the winner of the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe defeated the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France, to win the 2018 Ryder Cup.
The United States have lost six straight times on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The tournament's most hard-working American star, Phil Mickelson, made his first shot at the par-3 16th hole, handing over to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his tournament rounds, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark, defeated the American Jordan Spith by 5 to 4.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson has lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who is believed to have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup champion Sergio Garcia of Spain became the European all-time winner of the series with a career-high score of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop crying.
It's been a rough year.
Thank you so much, Thomas, for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very, very happy to be able to win back the trophy.
It's a team effort, and I'm happy to be able to help it", said Garcia, who was emotional after the European victory.
He hands the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who knocked out US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's singles.
"Beating Tiger Woods is an incredible feeling of pride, and I grew up watching him", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and currently holds a professional Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Jack Nicklaus has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus, a strange record for one of the greatest players of all time.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played golf at a high level throughout the tournament, the United States had a hard time finding ships every weekend.
U.S. President Jim Furyk, speaking after the disappointing performance of his reserve, said, "I am proud of these men, they fought.
This morning we had some kind of breastfeeding in Europe.
We lost.
Greetings to Thomas.
He was a great leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll reconvene, I'll deal with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I am a fan of these 12 and proud to be their leader.
You should salute.
"We were overwhelmed".
