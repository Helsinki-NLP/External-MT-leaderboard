DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil's comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel does not see any basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team at the moment.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on you getting in touch with him once, on you talking to him about why he apparently felt one way or another as set out in his statement", Grindel told the "Phrase Meter" football podcast of the "Bild-Newspaper.
Despite months of debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to have continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case up to a point", Grindel said.
The 29-year-old announced his resignation from the DFB team in July, also citing the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil, saying that he was not ready to talk to the German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put pressure on me, but he knows it from football, so when you leave a team or change clubs, you talk to your coach about it, and I'm sorry that conversation hasn't happened yet.
Linz: Garden hut burned in a writer's garden settlement
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz Fire Department was alerted to a fire on the Angererhof road.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly through the writer's garden settlement, the danger was in retreat.
The professional fire department went out and found the cabin in full flames upon arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically to the full and fire damage had to be cleared to the extent strictly necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery installed at the store at noon.
That could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the fire department said the charger was in the area of maximum fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire remains to be determined, as is the cause of the fire.
It must be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family in the open
What did Lindsay Lohan do to make this incredibly strange action?
Apparently, she was trying to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") herself has been broadcasting live how she apparently wants to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal TMZ, which publishes a partial stream cut.
Here's "Kissing Luck" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and moving to a potentially homeless family that wants to make her a Syrian refugee family.
As the family runs away from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adult of trafficking in children.
She's not giving any evidence of any of this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this", Lohan can be heard in the video chasing the family down the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from their parents.
But at some point, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing a fist.
The actress, in tears, confesses how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This mission has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It's supposed to be getting close enough to the asteroid Ryugu to absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The Mascot lander will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: Death toll on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people died.
The death toll could go up even further.
Rescue teams have not yet moved into the desolate and cut off areas.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla's chairman of the board
At the beginning, it was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced the withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now they're both in agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is retiring from the board, but he can stay as CEO.
The British Conservative Party
The Tories' Congress is heavily guarded
Birmingham will be the scene of a power struggle.
The conference is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, front-line ex-foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed to the
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name duplicates for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the people will vote on it this Sunday - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" means "the one who doesn't" - Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His most formidable rival is Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party.
Audi: Dieselgate processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still there", said Peter Mertens, chief development officer, to the industry magazine Automobile Week.
In December 2017, the imprisoned and discharged Audi chief Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would be disbanded soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations are expected to be tested", he had said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in the handling of the diesel crisis.
We've completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was established in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "serious organisational changes" to ensure that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss it on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the head of Audi of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false emissions after the emissions fraud was discovered.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, sales manager Bram Schot is the company's chief executive officer.
The transition to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard has led to production failures at Audi, said Scot of the "Heilbron voice".
In principle, he sees a decline in demand for limousines such as the Audi A6, A7 and A8 models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult", he said.
Scotland is relying on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm is to join the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the presidency of the DFB again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can", Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Today's Sports Studio".
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, and I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would say that it would be 'remarkable' if he did not 'want to work on the future project' after the bid for the 2024 football championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown in the summer affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected to his first full three-year term.
The next vote is due at the DFB-Fundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM chief organiser, Philipp Lahm, is expected to work in the DFB presidium, according to Grindel.
"I would be happy if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to consult the Bureau in this role and then, of course, would be warmly invited to share his experience on sporting matters", said Grindel.
He refused to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador for the DFB.
Currently, the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic are in this position, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background is clearly intervening in society and football and saying, 'This is an important issue, we need to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration needs to work", Grindel said.
Weight loss correctly with a half-smart balance
I've owned a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but my body fat.
Muscle and bone mass can also indicate it.
The body mass index is calculated by the thing, too, but it's more like a sausage.
He doesn't say anything about whether I replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball league: clear start sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
- ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball League with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the vice champion easily won with a time of 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
The new addition, Rokas Giedraitis, was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The Ludwigsburg national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the compulsory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at the s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the top pitcher in the field with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni came up with 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the top scorer on the team with 24 points under coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
In the Basketball Lions Braunschweig, there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
New player Will Cummings led the Oldenburgs with 25 points.
The Browns, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, were disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run of the basketballs quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens a mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdogan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdogan called on the German government to extradite Gulen supporters living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship", he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were on duty, including snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is under criticism because it is considered an extension of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, screams and scary seconds
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can", Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night before about 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here. It's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with a French accent and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage during the hour-long spectacle.
But in between, there was a moment of horror when many viewers thought the sound of a collapsing metal barrier was gunfire, became afraid and tried to flee.
Soon there was panic, people were running around.
Seven spectators were slightly injured in the attack, said Hugh Evans, the organizer.
But the New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the crowd off the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone", Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the Global Citizen Festival were available free of charge on the Internet, as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and distribute texts, photos, and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
The many musicians and actors were cheered and applauded by the audience - while Republican Senator Jeff Flake was cheered.
He spoke with his Democratic counterpart Chris Coons on stage for greater equality between men and women.
But on Friday, Flake had spoken out on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, and it put many women on their toes.
At least three women have filed abuse charges against Kavanaugh, including attempted rape, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who he claimed had been sexually assaulted confronted him on the way to the parole hearing in an elevator.
"You can join me in an elevator anytime", Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends the journalist's expulsion
The government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the front row.
The shirt, it wasn't the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption to the press conference.
The journalist's actions have caused a great deal of unrest, which is unacceptable.
He's the reason he got security to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is true regardless of whether or not there is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or supporting or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Lastly, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused outrage.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but they are still being tried in Turkey.
Florian David Fitz is completely drunk with Ina Müller
He's as fresh and handsome as his fans usually know him, Florian David Fitz.
You've got to look at it twice already, yeah, that's Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced talk show "Inas Nacht" is known for humid conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub "Schellfischposten".
Ina Müller, the hostess, and her guests are drinking some beer, some wine, or even higher-quality drinks to cheer up the mood and tongues.
Many celebrities also have the courage to comply with the compulsory singing requirements.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known for movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment", and "The Horned Day".
The Municher did not enjoy the trip to the high north.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie -- his face is completely crushed on it, his eyes are just two little slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely laughed-out Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick. He's just having a powerful hangover.
To his fans, he posted some - perhaps not quite serious - findings that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And some syringe.
And the round egg liqueur that Ina throws at half past three, leave it alone.
The 43-year-old's drinking is really in his face.
His fans immediately posted some tips to fight the rumors.
They ranged from instant brew, fishbreads, or, perhaps most effectively, headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed seeing the usually attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nighttime drunken drinking is unknown.
But since she's been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
For a beer with Ina Muller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and disregard
The entrance to the 36-kilometer-long railway line in the Red Cape country of Treysa is hard to find and is stale.
Recipes for rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly found.
Scraps, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished garbage cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with the seating group to the cycleway on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the model object railroad in the Red Cape country, a more than a disgraceful sight.
The issue has been a concern for members of the ADFC Schwalmstadt group but also for others for some time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city's cycling commissioner.
The problem was already discussed at the Cycle Council.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular clearing of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the norm - regardless of any other possible activity", says Deserthagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he also brought the matter to the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebration on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, but the layers are also destroyed: poles are torn from the ground, trash cans are demolished, signs are knocked down, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are just the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
You're upset that the bike path at Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"The whole cycleway is clearly focused on Haaße-Hill", confirms the Cycling Commissioner, who is now also taking care of the new cycle station in Goathaven, which is opening today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be very expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this will raise the threshold for access to public property significantly.
But that would mean a police force would be passing by soon.
Basically, Desert Garden wants the Haass Hill to develop.
It needs to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycleway so far has been very satisfactory.
The tourism market is still in its infancy.
Our bike path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany", the ADFC members said.
As a highly critical hazardous site, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation on Asheröder Street in Treysa.
There's no turning point on the Haass Hill.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two traffic flows", she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but it is probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music competition at the cultural station: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music competition was a success, creative and collaborative.
D to offer a song for the Hiltrup, is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a twinkle in the sympathetic Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering for coffee and cake by the volunteers at the cultural station.
Seven bands began to form, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time aid worker from Albachten, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland nursery and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, as the district mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the writers see in common?
The towns of Hiltrupsee and Market Avenue were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig cut the alley in his hit song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again, it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short transitions with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg was told that he had studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen at a large BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic has been posting it all over YouTube.
"It's not about winning", Franke had said.
In fact, all the participants received a gift from Hiltrup's Gastronomy.
The jury favorites were nevertheless given something special - so that others could hear their songs.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which impressed Frank particularly with his music, and the "Lummerland Roundabout": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children also performed in the final again - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to the instrument, accessibility of the melody and recognition.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The city's offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very happy", and "the atmosphere was good" at the soon-to-be-full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
There's a screen on each side, four cards with keywords, which you can decrypt -- the old red slide trick -- only after you've plugged them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, the map reads from left to right: "First Renaissance.
- The second window.
- What?
Fourth Party".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
Because it's not the terms that are to be guessed, it's the codes.
One player per team alternates and the key is the key.
He gets a code card that says maybe "3.4.2".
The purpose of Decrypto is to guess not the terms behind the secret sheet, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe the terms "whoops", "fist" and "window" in this order and in this example so that his own team can recognize the correct order and the opposing team, if possible, cannot, because that's what wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the coder takes notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to party; of course, here, something like "party" would be possible and "Prag" because he watched at school and knows the window crash there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
While you may not know the terms of the opposite side, you can better match them with any clue the coder gives you.
So the descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, or you're making it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "decrypto" is the rule book, unfortunately.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and thoroughly until they can finally play.
The explanatory video on decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has started will be amazed at how much emotion is involved in this unseen game.
But overall, decrypto is not quite as concise as its predecessors and genre-primes, code names, which also have an agent theme that puts fewer words into a game, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's just a matter of ratings and not a matter of winning points, he can easily come up with a two-person version of it.
Kulmbach: Man greets police and harass guests in the bar
A 48-year-old man was twice as busy as the Kulmbach police department on Saturday night.
First he greeted a passing police squad in Upper Town, then he was also noticed in Upper Town in a pub while he was harassing other guests.
After he was clearly intoxicated and failed to comply with the police's order, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police inspection.
In the state of sobriety, he must also be held liable for the use of the markings of unconstitutional organisations.
The factory was the home of the Schubloks
The railway works in Pressig were the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railroad history ended.
"When buffers were banging on buffers, you could hear it in full press", remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the train station.
No one was upset.
The brakes were squeezing and the cars were scratching.
That was a railroad.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's home in Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald has a place been so marked by the railroad.
This was the starting point of the steep slopes to the north, which, after rising about 220 metres, has its summit in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, trains and shuttle locks were needed in the past, which were home to Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeships, coaching and train championships.
"The turning wheel, which was rebuilt in 1899 and had a diameter of 18 meters, was a big deal", says Norbert Heidrich of Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railwayman for 47 years.
The railway works Pressig, which Bamberg was set up in 1968, also operated locomotives for the sub-routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Northern Hemisphere.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight eloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for trains and shuttle blocks.
From 1977 onwards, they were used only for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were still being produced per month.
In 1982 parts of the works were dismantled, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that the site has not been better used, including in terms of freight transport".
On the fifth of January 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate held a pompous railway festival in Pressig to mark the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here", remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Rangier station Pressig was history.
"The rangers and the trampolines did the hardest work in train traffic", recalls Dinkel.
Any misunderstanding would have had fatal consequences.
Why Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images are here in the infrankenPlus article.
The first-place finish at the China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina when the Russian placed at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach this weekend in the context of the series "Art and pleasure".
With great ease, registered organisers and visitors were able to see the ideal weather when the special "Windspiel-Performance" event was opened in the open air area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It is held under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund um Walberla" within the framework of the series "Art and pleasure".
This one opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 examples of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
The architect Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the exhibition.
He's been there since the first hour.
So did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as a major organizer and artist.
But, surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have been active in the past in the selection of artists and have helped to design flyers.
This year, again, there is a 70-cent stamp designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at every art station.
The following year's poster, "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, was also available for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high response of the special exhibition.
The musical framing was won by Max Marcus Stadler of Nuremberg.
As the visitor walks through the spacious garden, he quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance to the building, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "luck tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It's a tree trunk, colorfully lit, playfully equipped with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 algae tubes as a soundtrack.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairy-tale-like and invites you to stay.
Eckental is Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate 15 years of K&G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts in the wind.
Halfway through the show, Siegrid Frey of Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imaginary statues made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Winds Play Performance" is a must-see for the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition may be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtans also made their misery air at that time.
At least five of them.
They were not willing to accept that after the dissolution of the church church "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has become a legend: At a bench in the pine bush they took the MGV 68 Albacht from the water.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's getting full today", said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep his head up.
150 guests were present, a real success for the Albachtner singers.
Especially on the anniversary, they had revived the foundation celebration.
It was a tradition for years, then there was a break.
In time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was made for festive dress had been asked for before.
The guests did not sit in rows as usual in the "House of Encounter", but at comfortable tables.
In between, the movement was in order: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It's an honour that the singers from MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound themselves.
Happy songs were sung on the occasion.
Almost as if it were, "A day like today, as beautiful as today".
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had in mind, there was the "Rüdesheim wine".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin name for "hop".
Once again, the choir was led by Richard Homann, one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction", said Holstiege. "He's so light-hearted, it's a masterpiece he's doing". By the way, this time it wasn't just men who sang.
The "High C" women's choir was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly Evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented a good-sounding poem.
There was a big bumblebee, too.
The proceeds will help fund a visit to the Albatros Youth Center's zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The elevator is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserves of USC Münster under the tutelage of Axel Büring are doing really well in League Three.
No sign of shyness or fragrantness, the freelancers do their thing.
And that's good with a 3-0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"It wasn't clear, but we already made an impression", says the rather satisfied trainer.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately committed to this: "This is a defeat we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied".
At the birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get it right, a game like this can kick", says Büring, who has many years of experience.
Finally, the USC with its routine forces cleared everything up and brought the full loot to its destination.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby like this.
It's not gonna break our neck.
I've seen really good volleyball in phases", Annacker didn't argue with the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents is going seems unpredictable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that", says Axel Büring.
He feels confirmed in one: "League 3 is incredibly good.
They don't want to look downwards at the fourth tier anyway.
If the West does not get dirty in the next few weeks, they must look up.
But you can't get a first balance sheet until after ten or eleven games.
We're going to Emlichheim on Saturday.
A sea arrives in Essen on 14 October.

The fans are already thinking about a successor.
While Didi Kühbauer is considered a favorite, some fans are proving humor.
Trendsport sets a record for visitors in Brunswick this weekend
Downtown is crowded on Saturdays like never before.
There's only a few parking spaces left in the city's parking lots on Sunday.
The city marketing lists a visitor record.
The trend sports weekend has been the best advertisement for the shopping city of Braunschweig.
A significant part of this was achieved through a highly attractive framework programme.
It's a trendy weekend, which until now has meant that BMXers and skateboarders are paying their full price.
Four injured after a cross-country accident in Hildburghausen
Four people were injured in an accident.
According to the information available, one driver had failed to observe the other driver's approach on Coburg Street just before noon on Sunday.
The cars collided.

Sailing plane crashed - Flight student killed
The pilot died in the crash of a sailplane in Essen.
The single-seat plane crashed on Sunday afternoon on a parking lot near Essen-Mülheim airport, a police spokesman said on Sunday in Essen.
The parking lot next to Highway 52, which is normally used for shuttle transportation to the fair, was largely empty, with no other people injured in the crash.
Emergency medical personnel continued to provide care for flight attendants and eyewitnesses on the ground.
The venue for an October festival was nearby, and many guests were expected there in the evening.
The cause of the crash was unclear at first - the weather was good, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen-Müllheim is a small airport that is used by pilots with light private aircraft.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dream Ship", Heide Keller became a star.
Now she's openly suggesting that the show may have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left the ship for good.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this job, travelled the world with a suitcase alone, and many of my admired colleagues took me at face value", Keller told "Sunday Picture".
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists are calling only Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much".
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time may have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans was shy about discussing problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
It means in good German: I've been misled", she explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was never, even though I sometimes appeared fearless and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "though I was afraid it might go wrong a second time".
The day before the official wedding, I was crying in the dressing room, wanting to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why didn't I ever get along with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've been too naive about love".
The night flea, which regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our fox is not a moth, but a little light-headed.
And the bright glow of a green rug in the Sixth Avenue blinks him with charity.
But it's a film festival, and celebrities like to shine a light on it.
So he's hanging around the square late Thursday night to take a break in the Aquatic-WC Oasis.
The public toilet system, sponsored by a large plumbing company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival, is called: the needy building in the parterre of a new pavilion is struggling to create a luxurious ambiance.
But tonight, the gentlemen's oasis smells like heaven for some reason.
So out here, across the street, invited guests who were having a great conversation in the cinema next door to the opening movie "Green Book" are celebrating the festival's beginning with a party in the three-story department store, as they do every year.
The name of the film festival is perfectly appropriate , as the works on display are known to come from all over the globe .
What you don't have to think about in an article about this festival to avoid getting caught up in the sneaky commercials for its 190 partner companies.
The fox binds himself with a bundle of scissors that has a good fairy attached to him, and two bully doorkeepers actually generously wave him in.
Inside, guests rush to dance to live music long after midnight or let themselves be played by DJ rhythms, shouting at each other, and flushing down exquisite cupping.
In the underground deli, oysters are waiting for mouths to swallow, and next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is sprinkled.
And the problem is, all the shelves full of exclusive products weren't cleared for the occasion.
It's been that way for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The fox is studying the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he's got himself into the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly saved lives.
In the household goods section upstairs, the poultry is tipping a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", to match the festival's award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily the one that a capsule manufacturer presents itself with.
And George Clooney, who's been advertising for this brand for years, isn't here tonight either.
But between the local prominence, the cassette and the kitchenware, a face appears familiar to the viewer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor is not far away.
And really, Viggo Mortensen, now in his early 60s, is walking through the crowd.
He's not being talked to, not being paid, not being robbed.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as constraint, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is happy about his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home of Mexico.
After a 2-0 win for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to Cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as seen in a video released earlier on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired upon by the players.
The Mexican second-league champion had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Bundesliga 1: ASV broadcasting after last minute playoffs "destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe: "So bitter a defeat". His protectors were "in shock" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had, as in the stone fields, as against the hedgehog, not played badly over long periods, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we've fallen asleep completely", the ASV coach was angry.
The hosts quickly led with 8:1, and Bieletzki's early break was not productive.
"But then suddenly a crack went through the team", Bieletzki summed up the second quarter.
At the break, only two more goals remained.
Especially the best of the show, Marius Hintze, met each other in the period.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst took off at 15:15, then the relay driver led almost all the way.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still three seemingly reassuring strikes (29:26).
What's the matter?
The impartial ones intervened.
Bieletsky usually avoids looking for the blame on others.
But the 120-second sentence that Steffen Mühlhoff was fined was a joke.
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times to the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, even against seven men in the back, and they kept throwing at the empty gate.
They're the only ones who can't afford the compliments.
"Now there must be a fucking victory", said the restless Bieletzki.
The following points were scored: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
The following table shows the following:
Bavaria: woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old girl from Naila, the county courthouse, police are searching for the woman's remains.
On Saturday, the Marxians dug a road near Marxgrün.
The road cover and several layers below it were removed, as the police and the public prosecutor's office jointly announced.
New evidence suggests that the missing woman may have been buried not far from her former home.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
The investigators didn't rule out a crime back then.
The Court of Criminal Appeals has been working intensively with the public prosecutor's office on the case since last year.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monuments Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a striking feature under the road near Marxgrün using a ground radar.
Using a dog trained to smell human bones, the officers bordered the site a few feet away.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacking attack on millions of Facebook users reveals the dangers that lurk on the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should use passwords to secure their online accounts.
In addition, security updates, such as those for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it is also not harmful to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending resignation as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed an out-of-court litigation over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost his license to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk is also stepping down as chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German supervisory board.
He can stay against it.
In the comparison, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in Manhattan Federal Court for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not guilty.
Musk has made it clear that he did nothing wrong and is saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He's always been truthful, transparent and investor-friendly.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company public and pay $420 a share to secure funding.
That would have valued Tesla at $72 billion.
Later, Musk rudled back: Tesla would remain on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, appoint two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 against FC Chelsea
Liverpool were still down 1-1.
In the top game at Chelsea, the attacker who was replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp in the 89th minute made the score 1:1 (0:1).
After six starts, Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remains third, new top rider is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard took the lead in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the balance several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared the line after a solo by Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah (31).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge rescued the Reds with a pinch hit in the corner.
World record holder Manchester United is slipping deeper into the crisis after the worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United with a score of 1:3 (0:2) and remains in the middle of the table with ten points after seven days of play.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against FC Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came on as a substitute in his first Premier League campaign after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the 1899 Champions League game at Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion by scoring Raheem Sterling (29) and Sergio Agüero (65).
Leroy Sané prepared the score 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan did not use the new top rider.
"Let's Dance" jury Joachim Llambi and Mrs Ilona separated
I think Joachim Llambi broke up with his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become famous through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Content) reports, citing Llambis' lawyer, on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert.
"Our clients have separated in a consensual and friendly manner", said lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, according to BamS.
The two of them are now more concerned with the well-being of their two daughters.
The couple reportedly met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi is from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television for his work as a judge on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as for his appearances in quiz and entertainment shows.
Arrested at a demonstration in Barcelona
- There were clashes with the police at demonstrations in Barcelona on Saturday.
Supporters of the separatists threw paint powder at police officers who kept them from a counter-demonstration.
According to local media reports, 14 people were slightly injured.
A total of six people were arrested.
Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the controversy of the past few weeks, GroKo has been receiving several in-depth surveys.
The SPD is falling behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is being seen as critical.
- The AfD Berlin has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the polling station, the AfD adds a factor of 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a count and are only 27 percent.
This is the lowest level for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens are up to 15 percent, the Left are up to 11 percent and the FDP is up to 10 percent.
If elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only get 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
The Commission has therefore decided to take a decision on the basis of the draft budget.
The ruling parties have a standing majority of 43 to 45 per cent (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they collectively received 53.4 percent.
The other parties also have a wide range: the AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens are up to 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, the FDP is at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the voting percentage.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag elections.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens believe Merkel is the right person in the chancellery, according to the BamS-funded Emnid survey.
Only one in two (50 percent) of respondents in the survey now want the big coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, while 41 percent are in favor of a new election.
Another survey published on Saturday also showed a marked decline in Merkel's popularity.
The Germans are also divided over whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent against.
The EU supporters therefore want a candidate rate of 64%, while 35% do not.
Aushang at Aldi: reduced price to love happiness
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
If you say that in Tinder's day, there are no more romantic dating stories, you should talk to Aldi about pussy.
Munich - In the age of digital fast food dating by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is a place of great love that radiates an almost anachronistic romance.
Yeah, right, a conversation about reduced pork, boxer shorts bargain at the polls or favorite pudding is undoubtedly still a better story for the later grandchildren than a simple swipe to the right.
Tinder app is known to be less of a contact but a shady exchange.
We've taken the test: How do women react when you don't talk about hot bree for long on the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
The real Hollywood love story potential is when love is preceded by an out-of-the-way lost-and-found plot.
If the guy is still emailing his worshippers at bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and their associates.
So the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch is very much looking forward to finding her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic pork".
For believing in the magic of analogue dating, she definitely deserved her happy ending in Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 caps for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerschule has been participating in the action "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without paralysis".
Polio is short for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, which is called childhood paralysis in German, leads from paralysis symptoms to death.
In Germany polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are three other countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccination, according to a press release.
Soccer: Gius and Zorc demanding peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on Mario Götze's fitness and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
It's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us", said the idol-friendly Gius after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on Sky TV.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush to negotiate with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the German football league Borussia Mönchengladbach is not in a hurry to renew his contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a contract yet.
There's no fixed date for when we're gonna do this.
"But there will definitely be a moment when we sit down and talk", Eberl said on Sky on Sunday night.
Football: Regional league: researchers VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
He gave himself up, the coach of the football league VfL Wolbeck, withdrew first (internally) to reflect on the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
It's back on the fire road.
The result is a 1-1 draw against SC Altenrheine on Sunday, which has been eliminated just a few minutes into the season.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We've narrowed the room and pressured the ball.
"It was easy to see", Fetsch praised his boys and went to each of them for the game to simply say "thank you" for the huge amount of counter-revolution against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After Nico Frerichs' injury (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from 4-4-2 almost seamlessly to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had a lot more game in the first half.
And chances are good.
But Frerichs before his exit (17), the new Luca Rehberg (26), and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
It almost made sense when the SCA in the 41st minute, twice in person, beat Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL freely took full control.
Thewes, from 18 meters, barely missed.
Schroer too was late for a Thewes handover after 58 minutes.
With Miles Geske's change, Fetsch on the left side missed another fresh cell cure.
When Old Reine's Chris Neighbor fell Robin Westhoes in the 70th minute, there was an indirect freeway for the landlords 18 metres outside the guesthouse.
The foul himself took the lead and demonstrated his danger by standards.
Westhues' thing with the right flap hit down left from the shooter's perspective - 1:0 (71).
20 minutes left, which should be a long time.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty box unfortunate in the 80th minute.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider was not allowed to miss the gift.
Wolbeck had to pass the final for several minutes before Geske had the winning shot on the wrist in the 87th minute of the 12 metres.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new programme of research and development in the field of environmental protection.

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4 to 1 against Hannover 96
Four points after five days of play - that wasn't enough for coach Adi Hutter.
Against Hannover 96 Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure the first home victory.
Stormer Ante Rebic, who was in the starting lineup for the first time after an injury, should help.
The midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a leg injury and was supposed to use his headball strength to prevent the SGE from scoring more goals by standard.
Readings before the game: How Eintracht Frankfurt wants to continue to climb, which construction sites Eintracht Frankfurt must close pretty soon - and how Allan Souza wants to somehow still make his mark at Eintracht Frankfurt.
Looking back: against Borussia Mönchengladbach, Eintracht Frankfurt loses after a disappointing performance of 1:3 - the analysis of our sports reporters Ingo Durstewitz and Thomas Kilchenstein.
Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
The plane crashed on the ground.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
A drama occurred at Kottingbrunn airport on Sunday at about 2 p.m.
Turbulence was felt when a helicopter landed, as police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to rest laterally.
Police, rescue and fire departments were immediately contacted.
With a big order, the task force arrived at the scene.
The ÖAMTC medical helicopter was also called in for caution.
Passengers only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident are still unclear and are under investigation.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, a small fire broke out, but it was quickly extinguished.
Report by the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate governance
Only 8% of the board of directors were female on 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which the Allbright Foundation is officially presenting this Monday and which the German Press Agency has submitted in advance.
"Companies will have to change their approach or international competitors will overtake them", said Wiebke Ankersen, Managing Director of the Foundation.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, men-only management teams - with few exceptions - are long out of the question.
The gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women in German public companies is also due to positive momentum among the medium-sized enterprises (MDax).
Although Allbright's figures show that only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
The figure was 3.8 percent last year.
The women's share of the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - stagnated.
Last year, 26 women served on the board.
"I am sure that Dax companies will recruit more consistent women next year - in their own interests", Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have indicated that they will not continue to make any commitments to increase the share from 'zero percent' to date.
Another picture is that on September 1, the number of women in the supervisory boards was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited to the board every year, the share would reach 40 percent by 2023", the report says.
Some even make a mess: luxury bodywork: Which manufacturer makes the most money per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros for every Ferrari they sell and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan is still in use today - in most cases.
Who makes the most money per car among the top suppliers?
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers charge for each car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhoffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made a profit of 69,000 euros in the first half of the year on every car sold, while Jaguar Land Rover only makes around 800 euros, while Tesla and Bentley are even putting a heavy weight on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are competing well with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros of earnings before interest and taxes.
On her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she was becoming a mother for the first time.

She didn't reveal her date of birth.
The 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival is being opened
With a torch, the tourism association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the association organises the wine festivals, which will be held every Saturday in October at the large festival site on Rehweiler Straße.
To mark the start of the anniversary, the officials, under the sound of the game man train from Wiesenbronn, traveled through the place to the fairgrounds.
In the already crowded celebration hall, the chairman of the tourism association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and the wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of such a celebration is a mad achievement for a small town of 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that", Starz thanked all the help.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically pulled out of the stage with the guests.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way back to us". Later, "The Troglauer" helped to keep the mood going.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Church was also celebrated, the association had fixed the drink prices as it had been for 60 years on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A feasting evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place at the guest's home on Friday, October 5, before moving to the second round a day later at the festival tent.
In Bonn: emergency vehicle in a taxi
An ambulance is parked by a road with heavy damage.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured in the collision of the utility vehicle with a taxi.

The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were severely injured and had to be evacuated by emergency personnel.
The 29-year-old emergency physician, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian was no longer able to help her.
Another emergency physician tried to do this, but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United is losing again, we're uncomfortable with Mourinho.
After the blaming out in the League Cup, Manchester United are now losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
The way we defeat West Ham United is probably still to be discussed.
Symbolic was the scene in the 74th minute, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored a 3-1 goal for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an off-side on Mark Nobel's pass, all the Manchester defenders stood still, leaving Arnautovic with all the time in the world to pass the ball to helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously far-reaching lack of performance.
The mood is very different at the moment with United's City rivals Manchester City.
Mourinhos's great rival Pep Guardiola coached the Citizens to an unassailable 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the striker's defensive barrier for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Aguero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer a leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri faced Liverpool in the Premier League 1-1 against Chelsea.
As in the Cup-out, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's 25th-minute hit was the only hit of the game until the final.
Shaqiri, who came on the field for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his slugger.
So after the Reds started the week with a perfect record, Chelsea was unbeaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, then the Blues knocked Liverpool out of the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (at Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the Gunners fans, who played for Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute to get a win against the Hertfordshire Surprise team.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart kicked an unfortunate return of Alex Iwobi to his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal have now passed Watford by for the fifth successive win and are just behind their rivals Tottenham at the fifth position.
The Wolves went undefeated in the 2-0 win over Southampton for the fifth time in a row and are in eighth place.
VW core brand is missing: Paris car show in the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show is held every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but it is a matter of universal concern: the diesel scandal and the fight over driving bans and re-equipment should not be allowed to go unpunished by the German car companies at the Paris industry meeting.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing off their new products next week, along with competitors from around the world, in the French capital.
Diesel is not really a big part of this anymore.
The potential exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are still likely to be an important issue, at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models with them, among other things: the e-tron from Ingolstädter is due to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC from Stuttgart 2019.
Officially, they've both been presented.
BMW's iNext is not due to launch until 2021.
The new 3er is the centerpiece in Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented from 4 to 14 October this year.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were well over a million visitors.
At least 380 people died in the severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second one a magnitude of 7.4.
The communication and transport links are damaged, there has been enormous property damage.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke through Sulawesi's west coast.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the death toll will still rise significantly.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
But many other communities along Sulawesi's west coast are also affected.
About 150 bikers are celebrating a service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking with a support team on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking was the motorcycle riders' on Sunday.
Anyway, the bikers' final service was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the spiritual concerns of the PS strong bicyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship service (MoGo) is always held on the last Sunday of each month at the North Helle House.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the season finale at the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, about 150 bikers gathered there for a different worship service.
By 10 a.m., the boilers were lined up in front of the church's entrance gate.
First, the biker breakfast was on the agenda and could be fortified with coffee and cake or even a delicious curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the Biker service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical was arranged by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic and quiet", says Rev. Frank Schröder.
Yesterday was certainly a new day in the history of the motorcycle service.
The Bechtorfer Homeland Club celebrates a big party: after the apple comes the milk
And even on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She fed her hungry guests freshly prepared apple pie.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also very interested.
He had his apple press in his bag and showed his astonished audience step by step the process from a ripe apple to apple juice.
Then, every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big jokers.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
I guess many of the children still couldn't imagine what it would be like to have a tasty drink.
But they were able to watch this important step of work that late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apples, which looked like a piece of hay, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Bechtorfen farmer had already filled up specialties.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the oldest visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good "Made in Füchtorf" drops was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents began to talk, while the children not only followed the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-in hillfort.
The active Fytchdorf comradeship of former soldiers also participated in the festival and invited some stations to play short games.
The home team will also be hosting an action day next year.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the Savings Village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of the environment.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth place: "Fancy situation"
After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around him and spoke up to them.
However, there were many positive points not seen before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shit situation, but you have to come out as a team", said 96-year-old Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "It's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of action".
The further-developed Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) was successful, is at the bottom of the table with two counters and is a candidate for relegation in its current form.
Led by the superior Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first home victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) scored in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who led the table with seven points after the successful Europa League qualification match against Lazio Roma.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of Hesse in his debut and never got the hang of Hannover's defence.
The long-held striker after the World Cup showed with his pace and agility why he is so valuable to the team.
Alongside Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by Liverpool, was also the first in the starting line-up of the Frankfurters, who started off on a strong footing.
A headball forged onto the goal net by Lucas Torró (17 years) posed danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-man defender around Felipe, who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership of the householders was almost inevitable and well deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball to a defended corner into the penalty area, Haller extended his head to the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defender from French second division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still in the break.
This time, Haller was just like his partner Rebic, who was a good thinker and left no chance for 96th-seeded Michael Esser.
In the half, Hannover-coach Breitengräiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in two new offensive forces, Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Dutch were now playing a little bolder, but the ideas that were stirring up remained until the end, when they finally reached the finish line.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After a hardly hour, Rebic launched a solo and then crossed De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a showdown for the Frankfurters against overcrowded guests, and Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
Morlaix Square is becoming a party mile
Despite the cool temperatures, the atmosphere was good at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
Munich mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the opening of the 185th in front of millions of people.
Munich's been hit twice last week.
Geisingen: Christians celebrating the feast of the Holy Cross
The Catholics of Geisinger celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or on Sunday after.
The feast service takes place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the Christ shot, which dates back to the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a legendary Swedish soldier.
The gunshot wound bleed.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the Christ who was shot, which led to the building of the Holy Cross Church.
This one is not finished to this day, only the altar stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a symbol of hope, comfort, and life.
The service was poorly attended despite its importance to the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the final blessing ended the church part of the feast of the cross.
For many years the Catholic Church choir has been inviting Catholic parishioners to the secular part of the feast.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather-appropriate farmhouse ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish continued to offer guided tours of the town church, and Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed the visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone and windows, as well as the construction work to be carried out until next year.
After the platform had been in place for some time, the damage was more accurately determined and the individual tenders were more specifically prepared.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, as the damage already present a few years ago has become greater, but more has been detected, which was only possible by opening the doors with a scaffold.
The work on the sock is complete, the natural stone works are to be started before winter and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
The new residence in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße is being inaugurated.
The Danube-Iller Life Assistance Centre is opening a new home for people with disabilities on Münsterblickstraße.
That a "very special house" will now be handed over to his destiny on Münsterblickstraße - all present agreed at the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Donau-Iller residence for some time now rely on the special architecture of the new building.
The architect Rudolf Bader took into account wider hallways, hallways and doors, larger rooms and accessible access to all areas in his design.
The first planning began about eight years ago when the former US Army officer building was put on the testbed for residents with a mobile phone cap. "The house had come into its age and was no longer up to date", Bader explained.
In 2016, the miners came to tear down the house.
The architect said the new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that its inhabitants can feel comfortable.
Donau-Iller is opening a new residence
The aid for the new building was invested in the amount of some 4.6 million euros.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
For this, the director of life support, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him.
The gap between an accessible and fireproof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house is geared to the special needs of its residents who need aids to be mobile".
The accommodation and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And he added: "The land in this situation is a real lucky one, because it is no longer available for purchase in the current situation".
In total, the new residential building on Münsterblickstraße has a floor area of almost 1500 square metres for 30 persons with disabilities, divided into three groups of dwellings.
Heinz, managing director of life support, is proud of the 11 full-time staff, all of whom are employed on a regular basis.
Germany: Sister complains of differences between East and West
- Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy chairman of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, called on all her countrymen not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not settle for these differences", the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the daily Mirror on Sunday.
The objective must remain to create a level playing field throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less pay.
"I can explain this to no one almost 30 years after the German unity", said Sisterig.
North Korea: Will this clean dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan Hound is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae-in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two about one-year-old dogs reached their recipients on Thursday.
They then passed the border area of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the animals' adjustment".
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to participate jointly in international sporting events such as the 2020 Olympics and to jointly apply for the 2032 Olympics.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile propulsion.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
To mark the centenary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year, many new books have been published, mostly looking back at the past hundred years.
It is quite different from what Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, says in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the draft budget.
The Commission has not yet taken any action to resolve the problem of the situation in the Member States.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to ask themselves the legitimate question of what is the difference between work and work in kind, but let it be so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to re-engage in its task of governance, it should not be deterred by debate on the concept.
The Union and the SPD will probably see whether they can actually do something together after the provocations and slanders of the past few weeks.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties will meet at the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to call this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on, a lesson from all the fighting.
First, however, the issue of diesel equipment and the Migration Act are once again controversial.
The CSU Minister for Transport Scheuer wants to give the car companies a shiny ride with exchange bonuses, and SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in an obligation to technical re-equip older diesel.
While the diesel crisis over the weekend brought about a rapprochement, the Union and SPD are still far from each other on the planned Migration Act.
The SPD calls for a residence prospect for rejected asylum seekers who are working or studying.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'track change' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be a dispute among the coalition partners again - and how could it be any different?
The Group has not merged into one, but three partners with very different societal views and priorities.
Fighting is good.
Without dispute, a society characterized by such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests cannot prosper.
But to be constructive, dispute must not be rebuilt on the question of being or not being on party grounds.
It's still politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD are to argue, but always with the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is possible and beneficial for many?
This guide can be used to clarify both the diesel and the track change issues in a pragmatic way - and thus to regain confidence.
This is what the People's Parties must fight for.
Fungus checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the target
Does the Minister of Labour violate the law on employment?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
The Commission's proposals for a new social security system are not yet in place.
In the case of the list-fungus mandate holder Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament by way of a request.
It assumes that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the work of her team and did not want to announce any violations of the law in force in front of cameras".
However, she now has questions to help her to "exonerate Hartinger of all suspicion".
Police are taking a road in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - The police have long refused to comment.
Now we have confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route in the Marxgreen area is still closed until Monday.
It was predicted that the investigators had used an archaeology dog before.
The dog, specially trained to smell old human bones, was finally able to narrow the relevant area to a few feet with his guide in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the road.
For more than a year, the prosecutor's office and the court's criminal investigation have been working on the missing persons case.
A cycleway has been blocked and examined with sonar devices at Marxgrün, because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been sharpened here during the construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: cravings in Barcelona before Catalan anniversary
On Monday, the disputed independence referendum in Catalonia marks the first anniversary.
But before that, it's crawl.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the fall of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence activists, including with paint powder, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard.
Some 3,000 police and Guardia Civil officers were holding a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed in the electoral districts during the illegal referendum last year.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also taken place.
The Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central state security forces apart, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 or so separatists, however, had tried to break through the police chain by force, throwing at the officers with paintbuttles and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
On Monday, the first anniversary of the independence referendum is being celebrated.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the aid is granted in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other separatist activists remain in detention.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
The forced administration was terminated after the new Catalan government took office in May.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Westphalia: Councillessness gathered: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split without a goal
Red-and-white eels continue to step on the spot.
The result was a 0-0 draw with FC Gütersloh.
The final light and the third last one exposed them to 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as a mass of disrespect.
The first half was easily controlled by the entertainment factor.
So if you prefer to get a beer or a sausage, you can do it without worry.
There was no risk of missing a torch, because there was practically none.
First shot in half an hour.
For the first (harmless) goal of the whole game, Nick Flock scored in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only - possibility was for the Ahlens when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 metres just above the housing and after an hour the goodsmen also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ballerina's takeover of Matthäus Wieckowicz, things went well.
The rapidly proposed counter over Sinan Aygün was "crowned" by Nick Flock (62) with a but a loose shot in the arms of RWA Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also hit Wieckowicz (66) with a headball after a cornerball by former Athlete Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It didn't work.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than optical superiority on their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz got his last chance, but it didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to put the positive out there: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, zero also came out ahead.
"We were not as dangerous as against wood-wheels this time, although our opponent did not want to play here", said RW Ahlens interim trainer.
Offensively, he's been "screwing up" a little bit against a team that just wanted to defend.
I didn't feel like we could get a counter-attack", Daut said.
But his suffering was not felt as a spectator that his team could score a goal.
I was too poor of a thought for that.
Reckenfelder harvest market: Thankfully there are enough creamers
This is what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Board of Directors are delighted to see.
The volunteers say: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld".
When the sky opened, it was bright blue, while the square was still a little empty, but that would change over the course of the day.
"It's so nice to be around", said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival, Franz Josef Holthaus, welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl outfits as usual with a decent sense of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer soon jumped in.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creamers.
And the "replacement" was not to be taken away by the increasing number of visitors, who were entertaining themselves musically.
It was so good that later in the day some folk songs were sung.
"Just great", exclaimed Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening date this time in his schedule.
He's happy with the many assets with their stalls, including mostly clubs.
"There should not be a board", he said, yet thanking the men's choir for their action.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who were at the stalls and included the other festivals and the clean up campaign in September.
Our garden town is painted a colorful color - here's what's going on.
Then the maikranz was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were built for the physical good.
From sweet to hearty, everything was there.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, has been creative about his decoupage saws.
He had a lot of work to offer, including upholstery, beer covers, and more.
A specialty offered by three corner fields of imker: "Reckfields of Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a special feature.
Honey cake in a glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to come in and out, the cake tasted so good.
It was the company that allowed the visitors to stay for long periods until the evening hours, even without the stage programme that is not available at the autumn festival.
Local political messaging: No successful advertising for skating
In Lengerich, unknown persons have probably not been promoting the construction of a skating facility in a profitable way.
In several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have filed criminal charges of damages.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" appear on signs in the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding inscription was discovered on the billboard at the steps leading up to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding, it was easy to remove.
"A few days later, it was back there, this time splashed up", Rottmann said.
He assumes that the relevant advertising sign must be replaced.
The special note is drawn on this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skating facility is built, it will also be made possible by sponsors.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals, explains Jörg Hesselmann, head of the urban school, sports and culture department, without naming them.
But it's possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies on the smeared board.
Local politics and administration have been concerned with the issue of skating for years.
After the old one at the LWL clinic was dismantled, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The Council finally voted in favour of the fire station.
The idea was not put into practice, however - too many factors seemed to speak out against building at this site.
At the end of June, a turning point followed.
The members of the Central and Finance Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The city council has the final say.
It is based on a decision made this year, so that it could be built on a positive vote in 2019.
Air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European air traffic disorder in the summer, German airlines see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm comes", said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, to the German press agency before the air transport summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
A major reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known human resources crisis in European air traffic controls, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new lotteries takes four to five years", said the union official.
The market for finished lotus is empty throughout Europe.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the Federal, State, Air Safety, Airlines and Airports will meet in the city of Hanover on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about extra work and overtime, it will not work without us", explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control agency.
Maas again held the Commission's specifications for the lotus miseries accountable.
The Commission also concluded that the Union industry's market share in the Union was not significantly lower than that of the Union industry.
The resulting cost and staff savings for national airlines now fully reflect the operational business.
Mr Maas called on the Federal Minister for Transport, Mr Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to work in Brussels to ensure that air traffic controllers are not "blocked up".
Currently, EU funding would be coordinated until 2024 and further reinforcements are expected.
The EU is constantly under pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they themselves have sown in recent years", Maas said.
He hopes that the high costs of delay will lead to a change of mind among airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Air Safety Authority (DFS) offers a "coordinated training and future pact", Maas said.
The annual intake of 120 Lotus students over the next five years, announced so far, is sufficient to offset the age-related declines.
The necessary staffing is not yet linked to this.
The Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted to restructure the group
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
The intention of Thyssenkrupp's interim chief executive, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, is to split the troubled group into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
The Commission has not yet decided on the possibility of a further reduction in staff beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the control panel has only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed.
The final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, inter alia, the 50% share in the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to combine the business of elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence activists.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence activists in Barcelona have seen violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as did about 6,000 independence activists.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest trains apart by a large order.
According to the forces, however, independence activists have repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They said they attacked the officers with paint and shotguns.
The report also shows that there were also meetings between the participants of the various protest movements.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better pay and respect for colleagues
The police demonstrated to honour the colleagues who had held a referendum on independence in Catalonia almost exactly a year ago, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona alone as a provocation.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they choked us a year ago.
A 31-year-old Balearic policeman who wanted to name himself only with Daniel rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year did nothing but their duty to defend the law", he said.
But the demonstration is for the exercise of our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", the policeman assured.
Breach of access to personal data of British ministers
A security breach in a mobile app has led to the temporary access to the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory Party on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the outage was announced a day before the Tory party in Birmingham.
Two people stuck on B217
The Hannover police reported a serious traffic accident on the Federal Highway 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg on Sunday morning.
Two people died when they hit a tree with their car.
The car is on fire right now.

Football: Juve coach praises top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening alongside Valencia's half-hour", said Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3-1-1 victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star, even without his own goal, was the deciding man in the important game against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and he's doing well", Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early draw with the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and hung the worst defender for now.
The Real Madrid-held goalkeeper first set the pace for former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who led the team with a double-pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner, head-balled the preparation for the shot of the defensive coordinator Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had to push just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates", praised the coach.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the striker who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We must become even better at serving him", demanded the coach.
The best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus's superpower seems to be becoming even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the perfect series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already gained six points ahead of Naples.
The former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti's cross-country performance against Turin was not without its chances.
But no later than the previously announced Mario Rui (58) was transferred, the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to withdraw from the field after a hard start against Paulo Dybala in yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples", commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also able to feel addressed.
The German national player has made a name for himself at Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool has been in charge of all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said was "half an hour": Ronaldo had been flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is banned for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly flamboyance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention on the US television show Saturday Night Live this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused eyebrows to cringe and question marks to the audience.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "Ye", says the musician.
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West", he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince as he took his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news, though.
The tenth album was already released under that name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'you,'" says the rapper.
The first round of the European Champions League.
- I got it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game today.
The enemy was more aggressive, and we almost never put him in trouble".
Scoring twice in 90 minutes, so it's rare to see a positive game.
A1 football league: SC Hoetmar is under SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first one was used by Maik Krause from a sharp angle to early guidance (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after a great prep by Krause, he went free.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne first failed at goalkeeper Jos Shoemaker and in the replacement Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61), and Heinz Linnemann (69) all forgave him.
A handy meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved the goal line with his hand and saw red for it - could not be used for the guests either.
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball across the line was the game decided (81).
"We had been harshly critical of ourselves before, but today was different than in the past few weeks", concluded Florian Kraus.
The following are the names of the members of the European Parliament:
Scores: 0:1 crown (7.), 0:2 lead (81.).
Red card: Cortenjann (75./Hoetmar) and the French
Football: Circuit League A2 Münster: spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is in control of Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think", he said.
"We haven't gotten any access to them". He was supposedly referring to the wingless Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably all the other green whites who were coming out with a collective offensive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory", he said, still, winking and pulling away from his players, however, the relief was to note that they had withdrawn from the affair with three points.
It is worth noting that after a duel two teams, one of which, Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the class.
Understandably, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"It was by far our best season", he says.
"How we came back from a 0-2 deficit, how we fought one of the top teams in the league all season long, that was really phenomenal".
It's all the more bitter that you're going home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season goal (24).
He needed exactly two balls in that game for that goal.
He set the 2:0 mark on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was madness", Lewandowski enviously acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven managed to balance: McGill's left-handed free kick sailed through the long goal between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe (45).
After the change of sides, it was McGill who again made the draw (59).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crafty, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69) was out.
Despite the overcrowding, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia match (80) again.
We must now concentrate fully on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now", Lewandowski said.
The following are the main sources of information:
Scores: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.) and the team with the highest score.
The Commission has decided to extend the period of validity of the measures.
Soccer: TSV Strasbourg wins points against Primus
There was no winner in the Bundesliga match between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually come for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: All the members of the Dynamo Dresden presidency resigned
The entire board of the football league's Dynamo Dresden has resigned, media reports say.
Several media outlets have agreed to a joint letter from the Saxon Committee on the evening.
The association did not initially confirm the decision.
The reason for the withdrawal is internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Turkey: Turkey's policy instead of the bomb
It's good he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure from Germany provides such a great relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Tutzing Evangelical Academy will host about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to collect the price of tolerance personally in Tutzing.
Christian Wulff's term was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
The Academy's director, Udo Hahn, was proud to say: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have been with us".
In late October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, and on September 29, writer Frido Mann attends a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised to accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 meetings by the middle of 2019 have it in them.
"The pension is not safe!" says one of the conference titles.
"SOS at the Boundaries of Europe" - the Academy describes the "dangerous and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"and to a conference on Syria called "Barbarians without limits".
"Weapons, destruction, torture, death - war mocks every human idea".
From structural racism in society to the divide between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitalisation, the spectrum is wide.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to find solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting for the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday is coming soon. Some people are more likely to come to criticize capitalism, while others are more likely to see a "left-to-center" trend.
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church", said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the need for a European Parliament and Council directive on the protection of workers' rights.
"Suitable for both adults and men", the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner was held Friday evening in the hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaretist, Teubner was committed to gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and whatever else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and mastered her violin.
Ben was sitting on the wing.
He is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes even comes to the end of the sentence, and on the other a true pianist: Süverkrüpp Teubner accompanies him so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was that, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, which was the way it was for the evening's red thread.
Teubner had put into play a paradox: Man's satisfaction comes when he has a partner, but she doesn't open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is useless.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would have come out of Mozart's composing if "the Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüpp slides through in improvisation, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's g-moll symphony to a played dance.
There was a big round of applause and "Bravo" from the crowded hall.
Flowers handed to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not want to be taken away from an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo a performance in Wolbeck, in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.
The main words of the article 'Gender understanding with heart'
The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain CEO of electric car maker Tesla, but must step down as chairman of the board.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a double-digit million-dollar fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he wants to take Tesla off the stock exchange.
The SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements in its lawsuit.
I'm not sure.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly lowered the death toll.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
They've all been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had been in the hospital for one night for observation.
He'll be released later in the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The bus was unbrokenly headed for a control panel on Saturday morning.
Handball: Ladies' National League: Ahlener SG almost retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems, especially with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
"I was really happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We have not got them under control", said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The focus on the final left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a deficit, laying behind at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45).
It was only towards the end that the broader hostess bank became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed the rear compartment of Merle Clement on the left, who then "extremely cleverly made the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the measures taken are not distorted.
Volleyball: Women's League 3: BSV Ostbevern top performance in the top flight at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top flight, the women's volleyball team of BSV Ostbevern has once again established itself in the top tier of the Third League West.
In the second leg, VC Allbau Essen won the Blue and White 3-1.
"That was a huge step forward for a cool season.
It's great for Lenz to be in the top third of the league.
We have worked it out now", said coach Dominik Münch, who was delighted to see his team perform almost impeccably at the falling leader.
The first passage was dominated by guests almost at will.
At 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, he went to the last year's vice champion with 25:15.
Food was accepted in two bars, but it didn't come into play.
We've been busy.
Our opponent has been a high-risk hitter, but he's also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, BSV led with 12:8: "Essens has switched to three-barreled.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Food tasted good and we got a little carried away", Munich continued.
At 18:17, the first time the volleyball girls from the Ruhr area had their nose in front.
Although at 19:24, East Bevern defended four more set-balls, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class", the headmaster said.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge, with their strikes, made a significant contribution to the turn of the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: "We played consistently and quietly".
By 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-white passes brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also had a very good day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer and other women.
International: Turkish community: opening of mosque as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the Mosque in Cologne has left a shred of debris in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be reversed with difficulty", said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the German editorial network.
The Turkish and German sides have both missed the opportunity to make a joint appearance.
"Instead of standing alongside top German politicians to emphasize the Muslims' affiliation with Germany, Erdogan has used the term for his purposes", Sofuoglu complained.
The broad exclusion of the German public has 'reinforced many reservations'.
Home club Nottuln: supply has already established itself
After a long summer break, it's time for a folk reunion.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 19.30 the Nottuln Home Club is already organising its fifth Nottuln Folk meeting in the fireplace of the Old Office.
Almost exactly the same day, it's been a year since we first held a folk reunion.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln", says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln home club.
I never thought our meeting would be so fast in Nottuln.
Whether stormy January or a heat wave in July, the fireplace of the office was always full.
"The programme at the next folk meeting is as always a colorful mix of German folk, wandering and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits", says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites his friends to Nottuln.
For the first folk meeting, "birthday", Klaus Spellmeyer has promised with his accordion.
He was a member of Gaitling, a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, for many years, who played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the folk-treff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the folk-treff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frosks in the Night", enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again", the invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to arrive early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7:30, but entrance is already at 7:00.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
The Commission has already decided to extend the agreement to the United States.
Lastly, according to an insider, the chances of approval had improved there because Linde had agreed to sell additional shares.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
A gala in Dr. Stammberger Hall celebrated the 125th anniversary of the Circle for Horticulture and Landscape.
On 29 September 1893 the last momentum was set for the Kulmbach Association for Gardening and Land Management with a fruit show at the Kulmbach Clubhouse, and exactly 125 years later it celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach Town Hall.
However, he was still saying differently at the time: "As a district fruit-building association Kulmbach city and country", he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of fruit farming was also different from today's work - it was actually fruit farming, and no one thought about flowers and gardening at the time.
"At that time, in the Age of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite of the elites", said Günter Dippold, a district caretaker.
Fruit trees were to line long roads, so-called industrial gardens were laid out in schools.
Fruit farming is still the responsibility of the 55 gardening associations in Kulmbach county, which have almost 7000 members.
But this is not the end of the spectrum.
A natural garden, organic plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play as important a role as knowledge transfer, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The diversity of the tasks of a gardeners' association was shown on stage by the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Molwürfe".
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age", said the chairman of the committee, Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of nature experiences for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us kids, and I doubt you can have much fun with a smartphone & Co. like that.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner.
"The local association decides where they should be", added Landrat Söllner, stressing the special importance of garden associations for the villages.
The circle represents ecology, the beauty of the garden and the green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of many horticultural associations in the county also left no doubt about it by the district manager and specialist adviser Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the circle association and reported on, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
It used to come from the garden, it was stuffed for the winter.
However, by the end of the 1950s, the farmhouse had become a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature is permanent, it has been there before us and we must be guided by it", pleaded the expert on fruit and nut trees.
That is why the horticultural industry is encouraged to not give up so that our home remains beautiful and livable.
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
"We must stop the sharp decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren", said Günter Riif, who concluded the successful celebration, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Thurnau music club.

Priority to NAFTA talks: Canadian Foreign Minister delivers UN speech
The Mexican government wants clarity on the NAFTA issue: they are putting an ultimatum on both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving the trade agreement absolute priority and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the pressures of the time in the fight for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the UN General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she's focused on renegotiating NAFTA.
The Mexican Minister of Economy, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between his country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico agreed in August on a new draft of the NAFTA regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
The talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time), they are now scheduled to be completed, and the Trump administration wants to submit the agreement to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of negotiations, Mexico's President-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, wounded in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report in the newspaper O Globo, the former right-wing military operative wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives.
It is unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential election.
The politician was attacked in the open during an election campaign in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (German: "The one who did not") women's organizations had called for protests against the former military.
The social networks also mobilized the associations against Bolsonaro's racist and dismissive statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic capital of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As former mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind Bolsonaro in the polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but recently he has been an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of the elections reaches an absolute majority, there will be a by-election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he is running against.
Bolsonaro is known for his anti-gay and anti-black activism and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks me with verbal off-the-cuff.
Another time he said that Lula's left-wing Labour supporters should be shot.
Europe is taking back the Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have made another Ryder Cup mark outside the gates of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn's outfield team, in front of more than 150,000 spectators, overwhelmed the USA's favorite champion Tiger Woods in three days at Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsens website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known for the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band disbanded in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album Midt om natten is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but with all his heart".
The Prime Minister also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed at the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 2010.
Night in the shoe factory: volume at pressure air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone sack and light a concert night with the power of a tiger". Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" describe such a description of the live rock music scene on Saturday night in the hall of the Civic Center near Shoe Factory: Hardrock pure by three friends.
After the sound check and just before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of the lamppost.
After that, the rock protagonists from the surrounding area - all in partnership with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - are loudly enthralling the 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
The "Tiger Bonesaw" quartet with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika can convince us to start the concert with the latest, unknown pieces from their own feathers and the soon-to-be-released CD.
The band performs in front of the stage to a harmonious and impressive ensemble.
Although the "add" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the "Here We Stand" trio.
Hard rock is not the same as hard rock, as guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, bassist Golo Meierhenrich and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative, sometimes classic 1970s rock-like sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to guitar rock.
Not only does the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impress by the shifting of melodic passages to the guitar-like rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, gained a particular reputation since its foundation in 2005.
The band is showing off their hard rock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China tour - is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also uses his own accent on the only cover song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
The sound is still more controlled than before, and guitarist Norbert Brinkmann performs a solo while walking through the audience.
A certain volume is required for such a hard rock concert: the "Mint Mosquito" rock night is about 98 decibels, according to the information of the mixpult team, for the three-piece concerts of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition".
This is at the press air hammer level, for example, but it is still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Festival", which refer to "The Ignition" on their website.
The earache 120 decibels in bleach strength, as is common in the northern part of the Republic, does not require the Ahlene audience for this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, more rock-oriented genre have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, taking the bone sac and lighting up a concert night with the power of a tiger", all three groups may say, though in a more literal sense, at the end.
And most of all, enjoy the big applause of the visitors.

One dead in a plane crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A sailplane crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near the airport in Mülheim/Essen on Sunday.
According to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, a sailplane crashed in the fairground at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
The WAZ reports that the student was on board alone - the pilot is said to be an inmate.
The plane was already on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just outside a fixed campsite on the airport grounds.
But this weekend, there's been an October festival.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr-Region cities and directly off the exit to Highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride service for large events at the Messe Essen or Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump sings to Kim, "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is quite sane despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It's also about Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become aware of a new flame.
The tragic thing is, it's a long distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump almost found tender words for the half-old strain of the ruling Pyongyang dynasty, although it has proved to be a tough piece of paper in the dispute over North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was a hard-core man, and he was a hard-core man, and we were going back and forth", Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
- I'm not going to.
No, I really don't.
And it's not just the conversations with Kim that melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement to halt all nuclear and missile tests, although critics have so far seen little more than lip-syncing.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - was not for everyone.
He took the criticism that was expected of it when he performed at a large sports hall in Wheeling City just in advance: "Donald Trump says they're in love".
How awful, how awful is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he doesn't care much, Trump explained, pointing his index finger at the crowd, "I've always told you, it's so easy to be president".
But then we wouldn't be pushing 10,000 people out there into this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is well visited, in a good mood and also full of sunshine: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre has cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not only held in the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade union on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a cell phone video to highlight their disastrous conditions of detention in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the footage in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under threat and posted it online.
"They refuse to send us back", said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website France 24 Observers, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria", Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
He put his life at risk with the video, according to his own testimony.
One of his fellow soldiers was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks".
They didn't give us anything to eat. We had to drink from the latrine.
IOM is organizing the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent home this year by the program, said IOM spokesman Jorge Galindo in the West African country.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not unusual in view of the poor conditions in Libya.
He's never heard of a phone call on video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhuman.
The North African state, dominated by large parts of militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the African-European route.
When a teacher went to the local public school on a Sunday afternoon to prepare for her class for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there through a ladder to the ground floor or the lobby.
The teacher contacted the police who were investigating.
Whether the goods or money were stolen is not yet known.
Description: 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg Police Inspectorate at the Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man has been in a forested area in the central Franks for several days and nights after he stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the vehicle by chance near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and have been releasing those missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld reportedly was in good health despite the cold nights and the long absence of care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after failing to return from a trip in his RV through the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne-Cologne-Central-Western European Union (CDU) Prime Minister Armin Laschet has, according to him, warned of the rule of law in Turkey in a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This is particularly true of arrest waves, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important precondition for this.
Mr Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Mr Erdogan has reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly transferred to a Federal Ministry of Defence readiness building at Cologne airport.
It was originally supposed to take place at Castle Maden - but the castle owners had refused to do so because of political convictions against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance at the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country".
And we are also their contact person, not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the successes of the North Korean denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime is making things more sober.
Secretary Ri is demanding a reception from Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government at the UN General Debate of continuing to impose sanctions on the Korean Peninsula to block negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
"The recent shutdown is because the US is building on enforcement measures that are deadly to confidence building", Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will be the first to disarm ourselves", the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That sanctions could "force North Korea to its knees" is "a wish of people who don't know us".
But to build trust, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri said.
The US side, however, has not responded to this, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the UN Security Council had imposed three sanctions on the internationally isolated country last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations for strict enforcement of the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again to hold talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT Served: New Kitchen With Donations From the Community
The fact that they were actually at a youth meeting did not impress the many visitors to the open-door HoT house: white blankets and floral jewelry were on the tables and a large buffet was waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the youths wanted to thank them with the food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: A power outage had shut down the huge two-part refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over again: we had a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone", says Westbuer.
And so everyone started to come along.
The result was obvious, the guests were thrilled.
"It's not much better than cooks", praised one visitor, while serving Hokkaido turmeric soup or serving Quiche, liver cheese, or cake.
"It's really great what the children and youth have done", said Father Frank Beckmann, while the magician Stephen Lammen surprised them with card tricks and other artistic pieces.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of the National Executive of NRW
Frustrated by criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his position in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become nationally known because the Essen table had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of the NRW panels in July, Sartor told the World on Sunday.
I've had too many of them falling on my back.
The head of the National Association of Tablelands, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his longtime deputy to the dpa.
The harsh criticism has taken Sartor with it.
"I can see his step - there were people who spoke out who didn't know exactly why the Essenes were doing this".
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes", Weilerswist said.
Sartor criticized the work of his colleagues in the "World on Sunday" newspaper.
We must not follow the approach of "the people in the city starve to death without us".
It is the state's job to ensure that people do not starve.
At a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essener did not attend.
"I'm told too much sweet gossip", he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who were so critical of me back then.
Lorch are out of the game 2-0 lead .
Football, district league Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Hycklingen wins in Kirchheim after a draw - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 at home against TV Neuler, Lorch was already leading - 2:3 at the end and the disappointment among sports fans was great.
In Kirchheim, TVH quickly fell behind 0:1 but won after 90 minutes with 2:1.
Gladbach plays two-time lead - Shalke without emblem with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach will have to wait for a victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foxes play a lead twice.
Schalke is coming off his first win of the season against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league games, Schalke has maneuvered away with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team has regained the strength with which it had taken first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preparation by Jewgeni Konopljanka head on, after which the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Borussia Dortmund is once again coming out of the top of the Bundesliga thanks to an exceptional comeback.
Lucien Favre's team had negotiated a 0-2 draw with Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but still won 4:2 in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65) and Marco Reus (69) finished with a double in four minutes, while Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, secured the final round of the performance increase with another double in the final round (86/94).
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to be afraid of the Bremen values decimated by a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break.
Borna Sosa and the unremarkable goalie Ron-Robert Zieler made a curious own-throwing door that helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not make a successful but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang Gladbacher took the lead twice, eventually playing 2-2, and have been waiting for an outside victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was in charge of Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw with his second Bundesliga player.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the 20 metre long shot from Aargau, as was the second counter-shot after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is proving to be a goalkeeper in the storm of the foxes.
The French record-buying from the OGC Nice against Wolfsburg was the third consecutive and seventh time in the seventh leg of the competition.
After seven rounds, Gladbach is in fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the former Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first season's sacrifice, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued his team: The 23-year-old Serb cashed after a jersey sacrifice against Daniel Didavi-Yelb-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game through a curious innings own goal (68).
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens had already put the home team on course by means of a foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today vote to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
If we say yes, we could resolve the nearly three decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The United States had announced that the country could soon become a NATO member if the referendum was successful.
Syrians in U-boat detention.
A refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally beat three pensioners and severely injured them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had been running around 10 p.m. on Friday in the Alsergrund escape route.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who was attacking passersby with fists fisted, about his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat the officials and kick them.
It was discovered shortly afterwards that the suspect had struck three elderly women (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the ground at a tram stop on the currency street.
He also had his feet on the trio.
The pensioners were severely injured in some cases.
They suffered hematomas, bruising and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured, "for reasons not yet known", police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost exactly a year after marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave the word "Yes" on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper that she had not been in a registered partnership.
"If we get married, it's okay". He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesman for the SPD's Bundestag and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had raised a scandal with a speech on 30 June 2017.
He accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"This was your Schabowski moment", he said, referring to Günter Schabowski's accidental declaration of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption.
Garden day: 400 metres of fence cut
There was a lot of work to do for the members of the Citizens' Association Children's Home and the Leprosy Society.
For about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus was to be cut.
With the support of the residents, about a dozen supporters went to work.
"We are doing this to reduce costs", explained the president of the citizens' association, Walter Schröer.
And there's been so much accumulation.
Because of the hot summer, we're late this time, but luckily it's just a shape cut.
Because in the spring, the hedge had already been razed.
The breakfast always after work has a long tradition.
"We should all keep our strength", said Walter Schröer.
World championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the World Cup in the canoe slalom
Augsburg's Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the closing ceremony of the World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic circuit on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I had enough riding on the plant and it all worked out today", said the London 2012 Olympic third.
He threw his paddle away in joy and held both arms up victoriously, knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
He was starting number four.
But the six remaining starters failed to top his legendary 89.69-second time.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec came second to the Russian Pavel Egel.
Police inspector Gauting reports the first attempted burglary this fall in a single-family home.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of.
That's how the police inspectorate said yesterday, the first attempted burglary this fall.
The fact that it stayed at the one-family home on Kingswieser Street during the attempt is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8:00 p.m.
The burglars suspected the residents were not home.
The alarm apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for the new rules.
The bankruptcy of Hertha: reality: Bayern against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin is not to be liked by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will determine the first interim for Niko Kovac's term in office.
The first small performance under new coach Niko Kovac is not expected to rise to a larger autumn low for the Munichers.
"A week ago, people still thought we were invincible.
Now we have a bit of reality", Thomas Müller said after the 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions League match against Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, knows we're really upset about this, and we're gasping for Tuesday.
For the first time in over a year, no goal was scored, as at the same time the previous season two compulsory games in a series without a win, the top of the table in the Football League for the moment lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record-holder must be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1:1 with its run-of-the-mill man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle sticks over the outside have delivered within three days two blue holes, as the last seemingly overpowering Bayern are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and we will do everything to be successful again", Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, he dealt with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only to the again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless leave the first interim stage of his term in office positive before the country's play-offs - otherwise the tone would probably intensify.
For example, Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before his second King class appearance this season after a 2-0 win over Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second preliminary match against Ajax, which had also defeated AEK Athens 3-0 in the first leg.
"Now we've got two games to play, but we're going to score again", announced Manuel Neuer, national team captain.
As after the losing cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke in the same spot.
The legal counsel acted as a warner.
"I don't think all this is bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the big chances and make the big mistakes", the 23-year-old stressed just before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, which took the lead again with a point.
And so Kimmich, with a twinkle in his eye, at least positively assessed that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has now ended.
"Yes, that's good", the national player said.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan has accused Turkey of excluding Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan from Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but he defends the Federation line.
Now a new post is to be created.
- Berlin - On various stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the supremacy of interpretation in the ongoing dispute over Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President sharply criticized the deal with the former World Champion in Germany for the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause at the Mainz ZDF "Sport Studio".
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we have many players with migration backgrounds in the U.S. teams - that this will not happen again", said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without migration backgrounds as an additional integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
The President of the Council of Ministers, Mr O'Donnell, was not a member of the European Parliament.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England", Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral.
To be honest, as your president, I couldn't imagine that our two young men who have made it to the German national team were cut off.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would be appearing before players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm an immigrant", that's not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression", Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
But he doesn't see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should adopt a new proposal for a new directive on the protection of workers' rights and the protection of workers' rights.
"If someone without a migration background is clearly intervening in society and football and saying, 'This is important, we need to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration needs to work", Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the office of DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can", Grindel said.
Yearling builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to the police, the 75-year-old man caused the accidents between 10am and 1pm on Friday.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Height area.
She told the pensioner that he had run into her car.
But no exchange of personnel was made, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had fallen off the road and had run into a traffic light.
The man said he didn't want the police on the scene and then ran away.
Then the Red-Table went home.
However, the pensioner has been in his home for decades and has been driving and has been driving a construction vehicle.
Finally, the police were able to find him and arrest him.
His car was clearly damaged in an accident.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and could not remember much.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: still almost 1000 operational forces in service.
About four weeks after the Moorbrann eruption on a German military site in Emsland, 980 combatants are still working on the firefighting.
The German army announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to stabilize, a spokesman said, 70 volunteers have been withdrawn.
It is said that a further reduction in the number of personnel is planned.
On the night of Sunday, a super-terrestrial fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster case, which had been called out a week earlier on September 21, was called off because of fears that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements due to wind and thunderstorms.
On Thursday, it was announced that a fire attack on adjacent communities was no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1,500 local personnel tried to control the massive fire.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the German test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
The German air force has also announced that reconnaissance flights with Tornados will be scheduled for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was caused by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The Moorbrand's smoke flag was sometimes pulled up to a hundred kilometers across northwest Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr will set up a contact point to receive damages.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday homeowners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherine's in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after marriage for all came into force, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
- Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave the word "Yes" on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper that she had not been in a registered partnership.
If we get married, it's okay.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.

Referendum on new names opened in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the much-anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be named North Macedonia in the future.
It is located in the northern province of neighbouring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked every approach of Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the start to the integration of their country into the West.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saved the Holocaust from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in 2016 in the United States, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Holocaust for posterity.
Switzerland opens an electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve stressful family members.
The new procedure does not change the fact that bodies can continue to be taken only with the express consent of the Member States, stresses Swistransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This is to facilitate organ donation and relieve stressful family members.
People who wish to donate their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be withdrawn if a Swiss transplant is needed.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, institutions can continue to be taken only with the express consent of the person concerned, stresses Swisstransplan.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only five percent of the time, a card is found at the decisive moment with potential donors.
In over 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the deceased's wishes.
"They must then make decisions on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful", says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to keep information on possible organ donations on the health insurance card, says Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman for the Federal Health Information Office.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation", she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a reorganisation of organ donation.
The Commission's proposal would initially consider everyone an organ donor unless he or his family members objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in head counting.
He fought 39 fighters in Wolfsburg over the weekend.
Martina Flame-Jasper from the Science Museum of Phaeno, the venue of the competition, announced this on Sunday.
The 16 year-old Wenzel Greetings from Germany came in third.
The youngest World Cup winner was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retired Frenchman, said Chief Judge Ralf Laue.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
For example, previous tasks were: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants played against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how to hold a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He's one of seven Germans competing.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was already two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius or wonder child, organizers can't start laughing.
"Head-lifting is practiced", he said.
Many participants exercised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computer competitions in stadiums.
For example, the six-digit square root of a number is one of the disciplines.
In the calculation of versatility, candidates are given surprising tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The chief judge said the Germans also had good chances.
Otherwise, Asians are often the beneficiaries, because they learn to calculate more intensely and with other effective methods from an early age.
Invasive appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: It's about early detection of breast cancer
Tennis ace Serena Williams is showing off her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It's about life and death, but it's also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings upstairs without the song "I Touch Myself" by the band "The Divinyls" - only her hands covering her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is about early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications when her daughter Alexis Olympia was born.
An emergency surgery was started to save the baby's life.
A CT scan followed and blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
The government wants to ban more extremist symbols
- Vienna The German Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
The Turkish-Blue Coalition will send a draft law on the so-called "Symbol Act" for consideration next week.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle is shaking her beds for the first time in the west next week: polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the High Tauers, 20 to 40 centimetres of snow is expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintering.
Farmers can start their annual crop maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start their annual crop maintenance on Monday.
The unique "green wals" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor German state for some 200 years.
The up to five metres wide hedges and hedgerows are "forest beds" and the last retreat for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, said Ingo Ludwichowski, Managing Director of the Nature Conservancy Association of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were charged by order of King Christian VI of Denmark in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only a field boundary and a livestock fence, but they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their crafts houses.
It is also known as "Knick" because the branches were "over-knicked" to create dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, the fence stretches some 45,000 kilometres between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the impression of a wooded, diverse landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a replacement habitat by around 7000 species.
In a mile's cleft, up to 1,800 species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the key ecological function of the kink can only be fulfilled if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it will become a light tree, which will not only reduce the wind protection, but also reduce the diversity of species, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the cultivation of the crop can only be carried out outside the growing season from October to March.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesian talks about the situation on the ground
Local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND):
Were you on the scene during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me. She was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately headed back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office is also destroyed, but we've temporarily set up a place where we've also housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people stop outside their homes, there's still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people steal some food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly free to roam and it is difficult to find them.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people still missing and unknown.
How are communications and information on the island?
Right now we have a phone call, but before that, it didn't work, and we only got information through the radio.
Many people still look for their children, neighbors, and other people who they do not know where they live or where they are because people were not at home during the earthquake, but on their way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on that?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami", and then it came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure collapsed, the earthquake hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must for a long time renounce Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart for a long time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo suffered a torn ACL in his left thigh in the 2-1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the German football league said on Sunday.
Donis's body was diagnosed with a torn muscle bundle in his thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following ground break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of the time of the outage.
A muscle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the doors of the most prestigious European film festivals every year.
All the filming to the cinema in spite of this can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a compelling competition in Cannes, with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar nominees from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, Olching's fire department tried to catch a wounded duck.
The action, however, was delayed for some time.
Even a boat came to the scene.
Olching - A white, injured duck was spotted by walkers on Olching Lake on Sunday morning.
She was in the water station area.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and fire department.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck failed.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the task force again and again.
She eventually fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire department was able to surround the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a firm grip.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is winning a World Cup medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was biathlete Julian Eberhard in his stomach for a long time.
Next winter, the saalfelder wants to retrieve the precious metal he missed at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint the nearest medal to reach.
Seven tenths of a second was missing on bronze.
"I deliberately took time to process this", says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up on the missing precious metal in the new season: "The only goal can be to get back to a big event with the Constitution, to win something.
You'll have to hit them eventually.
The World Cup in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard's: "I've already closed the track in my heart", he recalls with joy his fourth world title in the singles last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated Austria's only single win in the Contiolahti (FIN) mass start competition last winter.
He finished second in Oslo (NOR) with the team.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at the speed of light
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interviews is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbot pace, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate are seeking to secure the slim majority for the controversial judge candidate for impeachment, Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama of Kavanaugh's calling, accompanied by a cultural battle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer fired angry tirades at the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to clear the way for the final confirmation of the conservative justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Republican majority seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who called Thursday's tough talks "crazy", initially refrained from further attacks on women and spoke of "happiness over misfortune".
In this way, he said, final doubts could be cleared.
Later, Trump lashed out at the Democrats at a ballot box because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
We will be investigating the well-known allegations of two women, no more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are expected to be heard.
The Ried Municipality's mobile radar, installed in a "civil vehicle", is stationed on the Garden Road from Monday 1 October.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on the scales is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football.
It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area", said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed in.
After all, the Kingsblues had managed to bring the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under roof and cover.
It could have been different.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11th gave confidence to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and pressing", Tedesco obviously played more and more of the head with increasing playing time.
I'm not a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me", said Heidel. "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to let it go, so they kept pulling back.
And defended Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all have a huge heart attack", said Schöpf, who had no small share of the head-ball hit. "I am actually the worst head-ball player in the team".
But in the end, it's all about winning.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start the initial phase with pressure and make a fireworks show", said Schalkes' head coach.
Victory was important.
We can finally enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played smart, calm and brave, so we have to play games over 90 minutes.
The biggest shortcoming of the afternoon, King Blue missed it, more concerned with clearer conditions.
The possibilities finally existed, for example, through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the top of the table in 59/72 or Amine Harit in 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a victory", Tedesco said. "You'd have felt the fear a little bit".
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only one who was shallow.
Fish tank: smoke column in the Leitza Valley 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
A pedestrian in the Leitza Valley observed a fire about 1:30 p.m. on Sunday from about two kilometers away.
Now the police are investigating.
Fish Bachau - The cause soon became known to police and firefighters: an unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter site on the Gschwendner mountain.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion on equal terms
They are represented by the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have been working for many years to get interesting people to Greven", explains the founder and chairman of the Reckenfelder Treffen, an association that cooperates with the Alliance for Cultural Policy in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani describes the writing process of the book, describes how difficult it was to explain the subject in a clear way.
With a lot of gesture, handy numbers and some kind of joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are there increasing conflicts despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table is German society, at the catental table the first generation of migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to eat.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to be part of the decision making process.
It leads to conflict.
The key is therefore not whether one is politically right or left, but 'Am I for or against an open society?'
At first, it's more of a behaviour, then the discussion starts.
And there is a need for talk.
An Afghan refugee is told from his perspective, two teachers are telling how they see successful or failed integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is a symbol of the discussion, not on stage.
The sociology professor doesn't insist on his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions", says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he was open to questions from guests and was also intensively discussed in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the land in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the newly built Landsham South area on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick is telling you.
The application phase for the 20 lots offered by the municipality at more favourable terms and prices, similar to the previous local model, has also been completed.
Frick said there were 100 applications.
'The documents are currently being examined' in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Mayor of Pleien, the aim is to have the candidate list for the 20 lots drawn up by the end of the year and to submit it to the Municipal Council.
The contract can then be awarded.
In total, 50 single and double-family houses and four multi-family houses with eight units each are expected to be created in the area south of Landsham.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
One single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of it on the open market, 20 lots in the social contract model.

This is how Schalkes Naldo "great sport" is even on the bench
For the third time in a row, Naldo is not in the starting lineup, but he still thanks his coach, Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat on the bench for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker Startelf, many people would have appreciated the fact that the nearly two-meter-tall Brazilian had once spoken so clearly about the frustration of the soul.
But as the Shalker players gathered in the middle as usual after a 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pro's, the 36-year-old, who is known as Naldo, turned on himself and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport", Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who had no grudge despite his resumption as a reserve.
Naldo, who was hailed as the best pitcher last season, probably knows that his coach has not actually gotten him on the line - but he is getting a break for good reasons.
A reason called "impact control".
It wasn't easy to tell him
"It was not easy to tell him, I tell you quite honestly", Tedesco reported the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the starting lineup.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club", Tedesco explained.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can get through it.
And that we keep everyone in the boat", Tedesco explained the rotation, which Naldo recently caught.
And the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age, proving himself an exemplary team player on the bench.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry continued to accelerate in August compared with the eurozone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points above a 37-month level.
Austria is still the third most optimistic country in Europe, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index still fell below the 50 indicator mark for the 13th consecutive month.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final score was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean the worst is over", said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have fallen as sharply as they have not since November 2011.
The companies therefore took down jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
Industrial production in China also fell more strongly in August than initially expected.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Procurement Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
The data collected include developments in turnover, employment, stock and prices.
Tuchel 's PSG team wins the eighth league game
The following shall be added:
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel is rushing to win the French football championship with Paris Saint-Germain.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won thanks to two hits from superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus successful in the eighth league game.
Last time Olympique Lyon in France had such a good start to the season was 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and set the final in the post-season.
The two-point conversion was made by Christopher Nkunku (46).
Paris also won the preliminary round of the Champions League group stage against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To kick off the King class, Tuchel's team had to take the only compulsory game loss so far this season with a 2:3 loss at Liverpool.
