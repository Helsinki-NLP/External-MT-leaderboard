This confirms the established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were bone-brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid-colored on the lower side.
The find also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rib, and all other features of the feathers - the branches and the hooks - are present, the researchers found that the rib was most likely evolved later than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for escape but for temperature control or display. Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers believe that the pattern indicates that the feathers were that of an adult and not a juvenile.
Although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the researchers believe that the pattern indicates that the feathers are those of an adult and not those of a young dinosaur.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team wanted to achieve would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also powerfully influences the Sagittarius constellation.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter is another dark matter that acts similarly to ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is thought to be contained around it in the form of a ring made up of many small particles.

In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with the marked choice into an envelope.
Once the identity of the voter has been confirmed by the officials, the envelope is placed in the ballot box and signed on the ballot paper.
French electoral law provides for this procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that at the beginning of the vote no envelope is in them and no envelope has been added except those handed over by duly registered and authorised voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the procedure, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are said to be Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Senior Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit her, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred has been temporarily closed so that emergency services can free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was later charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness accounts can be unreliable, as her picture was posted everywhere.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish courts operate differently, and the court has ruled that the publication of the photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, observes: "Journalists have gotten on thin ice when they publish photos of suspects and the like".
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is solely responsible for the prosecution, has told reporters that it will not comment further on the indictment.
It was revealed that the document would address the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the borders that preceded the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics to be discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered holy in both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, but the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to five years of such a presence.
The shooters in the additional pest control experiment were closely monitored by the keepers as the test is monitored and its effectiveness is assessed.
In collaboration with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc, the Sporting Shooters Association will recruit qualified volunteers under the auspices of the hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of the NPWS's Parks and Heritage Conservation Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety briefings and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have triggered failed elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of overheating of non-working iPods, causing six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it was aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company had deemed "non-hazardous".
The response from the State Department was that Apple's withdrawal of the report was "really regrettable".
Mariano was rocked by an earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said that no damage had been recorded in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
A few hostages have been rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers replaced an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research indicates that when the child is given the hormone, it speeds up fetal lung development.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two "black boxes" of the plane on Wednesday.
The moon has also been saluted by fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, and she died on the night of the two moons, as brilliant as she was, a strong woman", said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even more... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Among the 1,400 respondents to the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
The chair of the transitional government, Julia Gillard, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her view, Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with the demand that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
On the one hand, 29 percent of those surveyed thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while on the other hand, 31 percent of those surveyed thought that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 and 200 freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relays, but his condition made his fitness questionable.
He should not have taken any medication he needs to relieve his pain, as those are banned at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever recorded on January 25.
The discovery, announced Tuesday, was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by early February.
Comets could represent a source that brought water and organic matter to Earth, which could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to discover how planets form, especially the earth, since comets have not collided with the earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month he supported a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
They're predicting he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and lowering carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than the old stationary radar technology, which allows the flight controller to more accurately determine the position of the aircraft and provide more accurate information to the pilot.
They will not offer any additional transport and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and car park services and surface rides are not available.
Due to the fear of lack of connections, there is a possibility that the game will be forced to be played behind closed doors, without any team supporters.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has appeared on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species has evolved by crossing an endemic Darwin's ham, Geospizo fortes, with an introduced cactus ham, Geospizo fortes, in just two generations, although it was previously thought that the process took much longer.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes.
It can be stretched into thin wire that can be twisted and knitted, or it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
Because it can be thinly flattened, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called pH chemistry, and you can make an indicator out of red cabbage juice.
The juice of the plant changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH of the test chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix both powders and, with clean wet hands, form a ball.
The wet on the palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and a form of crust.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in houses in Minoan towns in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women met in mixed societies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back down in almost an instant.
Satellites have been launched into space by rockets, and scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, over 100 feet long.
The wheel has completely changed the world, and one of its most visible contributions is faster and easier transportation.
It has brought us the train, the automobile, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
There are also many small cats (including wild domestic cats) that feed on much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job held by a single cat, which protects it from competition from others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called packs.
The flock contains one to three males in a relationship, and up to 30 females and young.
Like a big family of sisters and daughters, women are usually very close to each other.
A pack of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not the best), swim, jump for great distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as full and unified as the lion's, but more cutting-edge and screaming.
The oselote preys on small animals, and if they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the oselote preys on are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that the ozelote tracks and searches for food (prey) by smell, since they can smell where they have been on the ground.
Their night vision allows them to see well at night and to move silently, and they prey by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island and it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment from where it lived before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to cope with them.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population over time.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, populations will look so different that they cannot be counted as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans expel from their lungs (or exhale).
Photosynthetic plants produce food by the sun, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the supreme predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaw contained more than 70 extra sharp teeth, and its upper jaw had additional teeth to beat anything in its path.
We don't have exact data, but it's possible that he had a split tongue, fed on turtles, big fish and other molluscs, maybe even a cannibal.
It also attacked all creatures that entered the water, even giant dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus rex.
Although their food may seem mostly familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual holiday dishes, including wild mushrooms, spiders, snails, and a type of rodent called the pollock.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat at tables at the meal, the rich men preferred to enjoy their meals together, lying on their sides during the meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each god, which was supposed to represent the home of the individual god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods by means of rites and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
At times, special towers were built in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, and they were part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan lacked large forests, so the cost of timber was very high.
Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and that he discovered Greenland on his way west and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between their peoples, kings, customs, and histories.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Forgotten, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is a map of the treasure.
Although there is a little writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was preserved early in its life in the form of a scroll.
Therefore, it is possible that the mark was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the southern part was still unfree.
It was ruled by the "higher" French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France, an invasion known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the American and French Free Forces liberated the south of France and marched on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a large group of individuals living and cooperating together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and is cognate with the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in some ways also denotes the size of a society.
The city-state is the ancestor of the nation-state. The culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and considerable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and therefore cannot be considered as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states with provisions for confederation first formed a weak central government  composed only of a congress.
Congress had no power to enforce the levies, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities to enforce its laws, which were often uncooperative.
Moreover, it had no power to repeal the tax laws and tariffs between the countries.
The agreement of all LÃ¤nder was required for the supplementation of articles, but the individual LÃ¤nder did not take the central authorities seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after the German national team, and became the world football champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern provinces, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, it is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by called it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to transform native grain farming methods and employ Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (16441912) military forces took control of Taiwan's west and north coast, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the Qing government was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), it signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Tower of the Sun, and the Sanctuary of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to help tourists visualize their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most commonly used photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still in use today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the image formats of digital cameras.
The 35-mm format actually  and somewhat unusually  measures 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the most basic ratio in the form of an integer) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the ASP family of formats) are identical to or very close to this height-to-width ratio.
The oft-exploited and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while providing a benchmark for image editing.
According to him, the most effective place for the main subject would be on the intersection of the line dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
This period of European history was marked by the enrichment and expansion of the Catholic Church.
For more than a millennium, Christianity has bound Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected kings and common people alike.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are intended for this purpose.
The seat of the church's central authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it really follows that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of cutting off the most important military and civilian supplies proved effective, but this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire areas of the ocean, thus threatening neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant views of the majority of citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job with the Edison Company in New York.
When he arrived in the United States, he had with him only four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the business manager at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China depicted different periods of time in a particular way; each stage of China or each ruling family was a recognizable dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between individual dynasties, when provinces were divided, the most famous of these being the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted 60 years.
During these periods, there were fierce battles between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people died in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to one ruler alone.
In addition, the post-revolution professions were open to all male seekers, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, as military ranks are now based on caliber rather than rank.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was intensely interested in things beyond this earthly life, and he would visit the cave known as Hira on Mount Nur (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very clear idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists, and the inside of the cave offers complete solitude.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, nothing is visible, and from inside the cave, little is seen or heard of this world.
Of the seven wonders of the ancient world, only the Great Pyramid of Giza survives today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many larger pyramidal structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' label looks like a V and the 'down' label looks like a buckle or square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the top of the bow and push it down, down means you should start at the frog (that is, where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
A bowstring from above usually produces a softer sound, whereas a bowstring from below is stronger and more decisive.
You can draw your own curls in pencil if you wish, but remember that printed curls are for the music and should be considered.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young child (Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced by an angry mob of Frenchmen to retreat from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They were returning to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point, someone in the crowd, in front of the frightened queen, waved the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The cost of the war of American imperialism in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people alone.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the hefty profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would represent the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they created the order.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which marks the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological need to the idea that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their application in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently produces "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we might say that as the automobile develops, so, no doubt, will the road.
However, the national road network cannot be economically justified for just a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increased incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for treating injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of Romanticism, individuals were shaped by geographical affiliation, and over time, customs and cultures associated with a particular geographical area emerged that were in harmony with the state of society and thus superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury was established around 400 C.E. and lasted until 1100 C.E.
Its status declined somewhat in the 12th century, as the crusaders returned home with gifts in the form of silk and spices, worth more than the Byzantine market could offer.
At that time, the fashion capital's title moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, the dress in the east bore a strong hint of Byzantine culture.
But because of the slow communications, the styles in the West could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great advances of that time, and the result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is the term applied to agriculture with the aim of producing sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often ecological system, using saved seeds from the same ecological region, combined with rotation or another simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures may differ in age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their affiliation by a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and argos.
One of the ways that is most often used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their growing up years because of neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Some werewolf children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, this form of child abuse has been the result of the parents' refusal to treat the child with any serious mental or physical harm.
Before being abandoned or escaping, wild children may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma in childhood.
Others are said to have raised animals; some are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When wild children are raised entirely by nonhuman animals, their behavior (within physical constraints) is almost exactly the same as that of the caretakers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, but it goes further.
It is not a learning method but rather a supporting tool for individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The boards can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is the form of the boards, but that also applies to the little button in Microsoft Office.
Virtual screens are an internal piece of software and are intended to ask questions, encourage and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving, and nurturing, and yet it is happening.
We think the foster system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The butchery was supposed to provide all the necessities of life that were not available in the home from which they had been taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of use and access to reward.
For example, learning and socialization are thought to be important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and personal relationships were also identified as a new aspect of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), who studied how audiences respond to websites.
The recording of video has made important discoveries in the interpretation of micro movements, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, they say that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it should be possible to detect whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks explained that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, have such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century suggests that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination with each generation redistribute variation back and forth between the two sets.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, with plant resources available in the savannah, can hardly meet its amino acid needs.
Moreover, if these needs cannot be satisfied, there are serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, which are difficult for primates, including us, to digest unless cooked.
By contrast, animal food (ant, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also a source of high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some ways similar to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is a process during which you deliberately wake up at your normal sleeping time and fall back asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will put you to sleep but not wake you.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the person to get up and go to the water.
The amount of inner peace an individual has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in an individual's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force is present, and every human being has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only thing that's holding us back from achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism, while based on the teachings of the Buddha, also draws on the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it's made up of yoga, kundalini, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga, with its yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, is a means of awakening the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment).
Central Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, where the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates an enlightened consciousness.
Because Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the USSR and the United States began to cooperate. After the war, systemic, procedural and cultural differences led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and they fought in real life, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and redeploy to the Romanian bridge.
But these plans became obsolete practically overnight when 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops marched in and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern Polish regions, in contravention of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using a cargo ship is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional mission of the Navy was to ensure that the state maintained the ability to move people and goods while limiting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to bring men and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy wanted to stop this kind of traffic, especially with U-boats.
If the Allied powers had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in taking Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goat herders, who were rarely children or adolescents, similar to the better-known sheep herders.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted of only parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat weaker roads of the time.
Soon, they began using sills to keep the rails in place, but they gradually found that the rails were more effective if they had a band of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron made the wooden wheels on the carriages wear out more quickly.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was the walking. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago, when Homo erectus (or upright man) appeared.
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Two-legged walking features are present in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but the hominin Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can make our lives more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to some extent reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must go to the root of the problem and address it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have also increased because of overpopulation and man's wasteful lifestyle.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Congress Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing plant.
At night, they made between 150 and 200 copies of what became known as the "Dunlap Flyers".
The document was first read publicly by President John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and one copy reached London on August 10.
Twenty-five of Dunlap's pamphlets still exist, and they are considered the oldest surviving copies of this document, since the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet, birds and dinosaurs share many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, these two numbers are called the binary digits  or bit, if we use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always the most obvious, but symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
The main indication of internal intoxication is the possible presence of open packaging containing medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check labels to see if the specific first-aid instructions are accurate for this poison.
Entomologists officially use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
The term derives from a prehistoric relationship with the spores, highly evolved human parasites.
Both predatory flies and larvae are nesting animals that are adapted to life in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease of young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that caring for a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption is a situation in which the biological parent relinquishes his parental rights so that another couple can take over the role of the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works, using the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
But that's not all, because an important part of scientific research is testing, where testing is a test designed to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers devoted themselves to the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views have been adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often substantially dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation by biological clocks.
Repetitive rhythms, not just responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of uninterrupted cyclic repetition in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments where they marked DNA in a jar of radioactive phosphorus or a protein jar with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary widely depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material and whether the germ cells are affected.
Only the germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to experience the beauty of the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
One example is observing, photographing, and getting to know the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in their cars to go to work, and those who work in the neighborhood they just left drive by.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is somehow connected to the passenger car-based transport system and supports it.
Science now shows that the massive carbon economy of the biosphere has been pushed out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone in society is involved and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why are so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they fail every day, is it because of the incompetence of traffic engineers, or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour is usually fixed to some extent, so traffic flows are fixed and can be roughly represented in mathematical form.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, the ratios between the three main characteristics were used: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate the roads.
The lizards were the first animals to take flight, and their ability to fly made them more adept at avoiding enemies and more effective at finding food and mating partners.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them even more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the snake-herder and the day-fly.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because we don't have a sense of the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, with a catchment area of up to six miles wide, is also the widest river on earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the building of the pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the pyramids at Giza and the technical expertise of their construction were never surpassed.
During the New Kingdom, the Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
In the Vatican, the law and official communication are in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the country's workers, while Latin is often used in religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of them can be found in their original form in nature and can be mined quite easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
In fact, there were four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he claimed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that you could put them in the dot at the end of this sentence to the trillions.
Thus, the pencil was a dear friend to many at the time of its invention.
Unfortunately, new writing methods have emerged, and the pencil has been pushed to the side.
People are now writing messages on computer screens and not even coming close to the wire.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The physics bomb works by requiring energy to fuse a nucleus with large protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart into a cluster, and then some of that energy is released by re-splitting the core.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay on their own or almost without help.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea, but thicker at the top.
There could be more rifts on the near side, because the crust is thinner, and the lava is easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize during their growing up.
These theories explore what it is that makes some people want the things they want, and what things in the environment will prepare them to do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are the Maslow hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.
When directors start managing their former colleagues, it is generally considered that they can start behaving in one of two ways.
Such a manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing the performance of workers, assigning tasks and taking responsibility for mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and chart a course of his own.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of a group.
Such behavior often creates a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups aim for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual group members often act as a point of contact for their physical group.
They tend to have more freedom than ordinary members of the group, as their groups have to adapt to more time zones, which their local leadership sometimes does not listen to.
Another characteristic component of a virtual group is the presence of a real 'invisible group' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
The 'invisible team' is a management team, to which individual members report.
Why should an organisation undergo the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When the departments of the organisation make effective use of the resources available, creativity and resourcefulness can be unleashed.
This can be done by using a new innovative process to meet customer needs in the process of cooperation within the organisation to overcome barriers.
Before an organisation can become innovative, management must establish an innovation environment and promote shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field of research and dramatically increasing its precision.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supported by theories in scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
And this gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand how processes are going on in our heads.
Although AI has strong science fiction overtones, it constitutes a very important branch of computing, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate branches that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it is embedded in many software for personal computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every class, and teachers would often be happy to take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution by offering virtual excursions, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire art in the classroom.
Posting the excursion report online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and they revamp the website every year, but the old versions stay online and serve as a commemorative album.
Although most students start their online diaries with a superficial grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Since students can often be the most demanding audience, the blogger starts trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, online journaling "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to engage the public inspires students to want to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The use of the online diary is a tool to encourage participation and the commitment of pupils to learning, even when they are not in school.
The appropriate use of online diaries "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by constantly responding to online material, students can determine their own position in relation to the writings of others and shape their own view on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and boasts numerous art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
A little further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the natural beauty of Muskoke and its backwaters.
All of this and more puts Ontario in the spotlight as something that is considered typically Canadian by outsiders.
The vast areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The population comparison may surprise many: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of its fauna and flora.
The smaller islands are mostly independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this territory, which has become strongly established in the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The beginnings of European influence and colonization date back to the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around Africa.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: We recommend that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks valuable enough.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can give the impression of harassment, and it is not unusual for them to be followed, grabbed for their hand, etc.
Resolutely reject men and do not be afraid to defend your position (this is not acceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
Modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronids under the name Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese as Casa Branca, and then abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
It was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Moroccan sultan, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is not difficult to find places selling traditional Moroccan delights, such as tagine, pottery and leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of geegaws, but all of these are for the tourist.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and, in particular, the city center.
Although Goma is safe enough, it is necessary to explore the excursions outside Goma to understand the ongoing conflict in the province of North Kivu.
It is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the best mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can travel to Goma by a bodo-bodo (motor taxi), and for a short ride, at the usual (local) rate, you will deduct about 500 KF.
And because it is also quite inaccessible, "Timbuktu" is used as an alternative name for exotic, distant lands.
Although its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport has made Timbuktu a despised city today, the city is now a tourist attraction.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the danger of desert sand.
He was one of the main hosts of the PBS special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is very different from the rest of the country, because it has more Arab than African influences.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different group of wild fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily fee is charged for conservation and park visits, as in any South African national park.
It might be a bad idea to buy a Wild Card, which grants access to selected South African parks or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and is the main destination for many tourists.
The row of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong are linked by a shimmering colonnade chart, highlighted by the presence of the Victoria Harbour water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
Urban development on the Hong Kong islands is largely concentrated in the reconnected territory along the northern coast.
This city was taken over by the British colonialists, so it's a good starting point to see the remnants of the area's colonial past, if that's what you're interested in.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching from the coast 80 km (50 mi) inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last surviving remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Basin.
The Sundarbans covers a large area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 chittars in the area.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, most, especially those to the east and Jakarta/Bumthang, from 6.30am to 7.30am.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most counties offer small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and durable.
By sharing taxis, you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby towns such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a drawbridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with the town of Saint Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two passageways that are 11 feet wide.
The bridge is 15 meters high and was built in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to start operating in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be completed.
The GuaranÃ­, who lived as nomadic hunters and who also engaged in subsistence agriculture, were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territory of present-day eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous tribes, such as the GuaycurÃº and the PayaguÃ¡, lived in the Chaco region and made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes called the "Great Indian Province", developed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the polo grounds in Las CaÃ±itas.
You can watch the minor tournaments and games all year round.
Tournament news and information on purchasing tickets for the polo match can be found at AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is set at the equivalent of the British Pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted on virtually all islands, and Stanley is mostly credit-card and U.S. dollar accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currency may be acceptable; inquire in advance with the owners about the payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your cash before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in a subtropical belt; temperatures in the summer often exceed +30 Â°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it appear colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
As the park officials say, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife.
Buffalo, Canada deer, elk, bear, and almost any large animal can attack, no matter how tame they may appear.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't maintain enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food that has a strong smell, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of Tupue chieftain Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland stretches across two harbours, there are many beaches here, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore (North Harbour District) beaches lie along the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming, and are usually planted with New Zealand Christmas trees pohutukawa, which provide shade.
The Tamaki Drive waterfront is located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a good supply of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex but pleasant and refreshing beer.
You can afford a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are likely to fare better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is not hard to find if you are afraid.
Australians perceive coffee with milk as something foreign. The short black coffee is espresso, cappuccino is obtained with a large amount of cream (not evaporated milk), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
Many hikers visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea otters come to the beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and may occasionally be seen outside this time frame.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans, and most shark are afraid of humans and swim away.
Sea crocodiles, though not ocean-dwelling, have their original habitat in the mouths of rivers north of Rockhampton.
By making a reservation in advance, a traveler ensures that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with certain hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation and even joint air and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need to consider the offer or obtain additional documents for your final destination (e.g. visa).
However, any adjustments and wishes should be communicated first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be a key part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you have to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
Although the music may be quieter on the main stages, it should be noted that at some festival venues the music may play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping sites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin, as the sound of breaking through the ice is quite frightening for the most sensitive.
Cruises from St. Petersburg include a stop in the city.
Gambling establishments usually do their best to make sure that their guests devote as much time and money as possible to them.
Their offerings usually include food, drink, and entertainment points to keep visitors entertained and as long as possible.
At some venues, alcoholic beverages are included in the price, but alcoholism affects judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who travels at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below the glacier.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the grip is poor and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep you trapped.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or wind-borne snow, or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly smoothly throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In everyday usage, the term safari means a journey on land to see African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often approached by cars and can be seen well with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes hairy, so you'll be able to see them more easily with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "jungle safari", "hiking safari", or "hiking") is a hike that can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events have been held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympic Games twice, the first being in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the reschedule, you may be in a difficult position.
The rules for cancellations vary, but most coronavirus cancellations from late March do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games are due to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while standard tickets will cost about 7,000 yen.
Licking wet clothes dries them out faster, and many hotels will rent ironing boards and ironing boards if they're not already in the room.
If you do not have a solder on hand or if you do not want to wear soldered socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the goods (which can cause them to shrink or even fall off).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other areas it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you have concerns, buy bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause sensitivity, or, in the worst-case scenario, cause allergic reactions, transmit poison, or carry infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can brutalize or kill humans are not usually counted as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the option of buying goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most demanding on the Buffalo  Pittsburgh highway, often crossing isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on steep roads, be careful, for steep, narrow roads and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the earlier and later sections, usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than usual.
Surprisingly, the cell signal is much stronger here than in many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, but in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, much like in their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pies are common, since cooked apples are found in the pies all year round, while cherries and plums are a summer favorite.
Most German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes usually go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a doughnut that's small but rich, try something called a Berlin doughnut, a pancake, or a doughnut, depending on the region.
Kari is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of that subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is a general term for a wide variety of local dishes found throughout the country's 17,000 islands.
However, the term without additional designations refers mostly to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a type of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese people adore being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The sticks support the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the rider, but can also present a safety problem, as the rider's legs can get caught in them.
If a horse throws its rider off and the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse could pull the rider back if he were to run away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety clasps that allow the leather strap to fall from the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
The CochamÃ³ Valley  leading climbing destination in Chile with its variety of great granite walls and cliffs, called the Yosemite of South America.
The summits of the canyon offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world continue to forge new routes within its walls of endless potential.

Skiing is a major activity of travellers with many followers, sometimes called "skiers", as they plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to as early as 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backpacking or ski hiking.
Although it does not usually include elements of these disciplines, it is similar to alpine skiing or hiking, which are performed on steep terrain and require very hard skis and shoes.
Think of the surf route as a kind of hiking trail.
In good weather conditions you will be able to cover more distance than by walking  but you will rarely reach the speed of a cross-country skier without a heavy backpack and well-groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean applying for a visa and passing through passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, acts as a kind of one country in this respect.
Within this area, you can cross the border without going back through the checkpoints, where you would have to show your passport.
If you have a Schengen visa, you also do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen area Member State separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is an antique, but some tax agencies define an antique as a product that is over 100 years old.
The definition varies according to geographical area, as the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
The products of home craftsmanship could be classified as antiques, even though they are younger than similar goods produced in series.

Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should seek professional training.
If you search the Internet for "hostile environment" you will most likely find the address of a local business.
The course usually covers all the problems mentioned here in much more detail, usually together with practical experience.
The course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid procedures and, occasionally, weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are in abundance, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo a sex change operation abroad should make sure they have valid documents for the journey back.

Security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people should not expect to survive the examination without invasion of privacy and with their dignity intact before surgery.
Recurrent currents are currents that return from waves that break off the coast, often on reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deep sections and a fast flow towards the depth can be formed there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue when swimming backwards against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you've cleared the current, swimming back will be no different than normal.
Try to steer somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, wait for rescue.
Shock of return occurs sooner than culture shock (less than a long period of honeymoon), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have great difficulty re-adapting to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect the same patience and understanding from travelers returning home.
The sound and light show with the pyramids is one of the most interesting things in the neighborhood for children.
Before the show begins, you can see the pyramids in darkness and silence.

The Sphinx is the background and the narrator of a long story.
The pyramids are shown scenes and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are home to several nations and have the largest number of bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano still serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the landscape south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plantoa, then re-emerge as the 200-mile Ellsworth Range, bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range is the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m (18,832 ft).
In remote areas where there is no cell phone service, you may be able to use only a satellite phone.
A satellite phone cannot usually replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is often used in maritime transport, including pleasure boats, as well as in missions requiring remote data and voice services.
Your local telephone service provider can provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year in their schooling, travel and learning is an increasingly popular option.
It is especially popular with senior students, who are given a year off before starting school without having to sacrifice their education.
It is often the case that education during one year abroad actually increases the likelihood of an individual continuing his studies in his home country.
These programmes usually require tuition fees.
In addition to being a boating destination, Finland, the "land of a thousand lakes", has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in the archipelagos off its coast.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lake are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national sport, with one in every seven or eight people owning a boat.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but rather rarely (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).
Most special Baltic cruises include an extended stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can stay in the historic city for a few days and return to the ship for the night.
If you go to the mainland only by boat, you will not need a special visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some of the cruises mentioned in the brochures mention Berlin, Germany, and as you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience, no matter how old you are or where you come from, especially if you have never flown or had a traumatic experience.
This is nothing to be ashamed of, for it is no different from the personal fear and aversion of other things that plague many people.
A little understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during flight may help some to overcome the fear of the unknown or of being out of control.

The obvious way to fly first or business class is to reach deep into your pocket for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
And it is not cheap: As a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times as much for business class as for economy and eleven times as much for first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it is generally not worthwhile to seek discounts for business or first class seats either.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and to charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been rocked by ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic links between these parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

The apparent rigidity of the Parisians will quickly fade if you show some basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its diverse micro-climate, different fingers and altitude, it is known for its wide range of plant assemblages.

All the vowels, except the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important way of separating certain verbs and objects.
It also makes it easier to read, although this makes it a little more difficult to write, since it is necessary to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in its basic form.
Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should pay particular attention to the letters c and g, as their pronunciation differs according to the vowel that follows them.

Those who speak little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to her that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution was not as much of a problem in their golden age as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses and are more accessible than those built later.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom observation, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China, where Japanese apricots were the most common choice of flowers.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the customs associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-Christians and non-Christians worldwide.
Tradition has it that Easter is spent in some exposed spot and awaits sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian spring rite and fertility rite.
