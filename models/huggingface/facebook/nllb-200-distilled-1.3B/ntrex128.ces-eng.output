Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about looking like Muppets.
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are dismayed by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament  Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
One Labour Party member said his group was concerned that it rymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid party said the group as a whole was not happy and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was approaching the name change with an open mind, but noted that MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is now preparing legislation to introduce the name changes, said: The final decision on what members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be up to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where it won broad support for a variant to be called the Welsh Assembly.
As regards the title of Assembly Members, the committee preferred the title Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the Assembly are clearly proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may be causing concern for Speaker Elin Jones, who is due to table a draft legislation within weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and a proposal for a committee system.
The members of the Assembly shall vote on the question of their title in the course of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians are going to vote on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
A referendum is expected to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested the country's EU and NATO membership applications.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would not follow through on the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will go off as the churches in Harlem struggle to survive.
"The old people I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", says Mr. Adams.
There's none of them today.
He thinks the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People interact differently today", he says.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as their leaders expect, and sooner or later they will be right back where they started.
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such people who would not be of much help to the remaining tabernacles in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white", he says, "and so the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become church members".
Both churches had white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose services were held nearby.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell tower.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the poor man's bell".
A professional who played the bell in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell tower in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says he hasn't had a replacement at St. Martin's.
In the past few months, St. Martin's has been plagued by a complicated history of architects and builders, some of whom have been recruited by lay church officials, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders, the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives, sent a letter to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the Council of Elders, although it had not participated in hiring the architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California while diving for lobster
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. this morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and then he and the rest of the group rowed to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the call was the joy of catching lobster, but then realized he was screaming "He bit me!"
He bit me!
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that his entire clavicle was torn.
"I shouted to get everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was taken in critical condition by helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark was behind the attack.
Swimming Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to take on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles with specialist salesmen.
As part of a strong entry into the UK cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and home goods sales are falling, cosmetics aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country, with more to follow next year if successful.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to supermarkets' efforts to find a use for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's says it will double its cosmetics range to 3,000 products and will also launch brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, thanks to branded seats similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique make-up range, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Saintsbury's will test the concessions of fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop in two stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and another this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift towards daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl by offering better services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and also launched a number of Habitat departments, which are chains it bought two years ago, which have increased food sales and made acquisitions even more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to redesign its cosmetics and pharmacy department ended in disgrace.
At the turn of the millennium, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of the drug in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds chain of pharmacies.
Lloyds is to play its part in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's sales manager Paul Mills-Hicks says: "We have changed the look and style of the cosmetics aisle to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues to consult with customers.
Our range of brands should cater to all needs and the enticing environment and convenient location mean that we now present an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change the old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby walked away from an £11 million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby walked away from an $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and accessories, Trula.
The couple's business has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of the show announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Day star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was furious when the TV star admitted at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that new contracts worth up to £1.5 million would mean he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their homewear and accessories brand Trula.
The venture has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and could double presenter Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones left Britain for one of her summer residences.
An unnamed source says Trula's brand was Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, to secure her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was a complete shock to all involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The headquarters in Marlow is stocked with goods ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions, given the heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares and the possible further delay in launching the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
Couples go on vacations together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business dealings".

He joked about the criticism he'd get from journalists for a remark some considered "unpresidentially unseemly" and for his positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous voter vote.
I've given up nothing.
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards denuclearizing North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not seeing an "appropriate response" from the US to its first steps toward disarmament.
The US, instead, continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: the end of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the repatriation of the remains of American troops.
And he defended his unusual approach to reporting on his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami waves and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's inhabitants have been driven from their homes, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit difficult, says Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pala, but it is not yet clear if foreign staff can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paulo to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur so frequently in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared for Mother Nature's wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common in other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Paulo, even though a tsunami warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, travel between many of Indonesia's islands is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics are even more difficult.
The hospital ship that anchored in Lombok to help earthquake victims is now moving to Paulo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was a major focus of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He'll be running for re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding cuts.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with members of the Muslim majority adopting a more conservative form of the faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a goal in the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, saving Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as his side lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left and shot it to the far bar.
The missile was flying high and heading for the top right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually passed the bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get in the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I wanted to buy as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn't think much about it and I fired at a single touch.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a Belgian star Eden Hazard's goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passes back to Mate Kovacic, then turns around in the middle of the field and sprints to half of Liverpool.
The blacksmith passed the ball quickly.
Then he sent the ball down a nice alley to Hazard in the lime.
He ran to the defense and hit a left to the far post next to Liverpool's Alison Becker.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play the home team in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London with Videoton.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The Indonesian Disaster Management Agency reported Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
The 7.5-magnitude quake struck on Friday, sending waves up to 20 feet high and trapping many people in the rubble of collapsed buildings, government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Paulo, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with rubble.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning and police immediately opened a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are calling on people in the area who saw or heard anything to report it.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would like to appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, whose cab cameras might have caught anything, to contact us, because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
Friends arrived at the scene this afternoon who think they know the woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police say they're investigating and are now informing the victims' relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
Residents have now been told it will take several hours before they can return home.
One person was told by a police officer that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He keeps saying "this is terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans behind the tape and another one waiting outside.
There's a line of police officers in the restricted area, monitoring the house.
Anyone with information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and enter the code 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has recently become a hit due to the controversy over " rewriting history "
His expulsion would be a deserved punishment for his fanatical, Taliban-style Puritan followers destroying many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "a foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: "In the ongoing debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not command or administer iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a character many still think deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people regard Cromwell, although a little less so today than in the late 19th century, as a defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of relentless historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identified figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Killer pig rips Chinese farmer apart
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southeastern China.
A man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a marketplace in Liou-phan-shue, Kuezhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to administer a vaccine to pigs in a pig pen on 30 May 2005 in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next barn open.
He said there was a big pig in the barn with a mouth full of blood.
According to the information, the forensic examination confirmed that the 250kg pig tore the farmer.
"The nephew had his legs bloodied and torn", the Guiyang Evening News quoted his cousin, who goes by the surname Wu.
Security footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to keep anyone else from getting hurt while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, critically injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor and was driven away by the farmer's wife.
After eating a pig in 2012, a farmer in Oregon and Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste for blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect, he said.
Hurricane Rosa 's remnants will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States .
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, it will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time, Rosa reached winds of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 400 miles [620 km] southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin pushing tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday.
Tropical humidity, with a low pressure trough approaching, will cause heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rainfall of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous tidal floods, mudflows and possible desert landslides.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall to approach 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, tidal floods can occur due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
In view of the danger of tropical rainfall, it would be very unwise to go on foot into the desert.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms bring local gusty winds and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure trough will bring heavy local downpours to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause minor debris flows and slippery roads.
It will be the first rains of the rainy season in this region.
Sunday night and Monday morning, rare tropical storms will begin to approach Arizona, and Monday night and Tuesday, rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but it's still going to be quite warm in the tropics.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of the dramatic temperature difference is in the middle of the United States on a Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will again attempt to extend the summer's smoldering heat.
In most of the central and eastern U.S., warm early October is expected, with temperatures of about 90 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C] from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern U.S.
In New York City, it could be 90 degrees on Tuesday, about six degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh 's hearing was watched by over 20 million people .
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's compelling testimony on six television networks from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programming with reports of a sudden Friday twist: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-day investigation into the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk at a high school party and tried to strip her dress.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional statement that he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
The event was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers for other stations that broadcast the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in offices.
That's similar to the number of people watching a football game in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings of any station, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
Second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued after the meeting.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught him being shouted at by protesters as he prepared to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
CNN was live on the scene, and he stood there for a few minutes with his eyes down and he was cursing.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He also heard, "You have power, while many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and cable networks later broadcast live as the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on whether to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote of the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, as the Democratic minority demanded.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "political" Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politically preying on Britain's future and undermining national interests".
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, on September 29, 2018.
In another conversation that was close to the one with the prime minister on the front page, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs is "totally nonsensical".
Police have arrested Dyton Simpson, a suspect in the death of an LSU quarterback.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department says that Dyteon Simson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WABF, police seized the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Police say Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde after questioning.
According to the lawyer, bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Coroner's office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their vigilance and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death shocked the team and shocked him.
"This is what you're always afraid of", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash from the Popacatépetl volcano has washed into the southern district of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it increased activity, releasing 183 gas and ash in 24 hours.
The Centre has been following a series of rumblings and tremors.
Images of windshields covered in a thin layer of ash have appeared on social media in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded increased activity at the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capitals.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote, police clash with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with law enforcement and thousands of people joined competitive demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
Security forces blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powdered paint at them, creating a dark cloud of dust in the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, riots broke out, which the police had to quell with batons.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of pro-union protesters who chanted "Long live Spain".
According to local media, 14 people were lightly injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans are celebrating, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but turnout was low because opponents of secession boycotted the elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to disrupt voting at polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed out all night Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration went on, but she had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in a separatist protest, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
My parents were crying for the vote, but now we're in a dead end", he said.
Despite a significant, if close, victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep things going this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either gone into exile themselves or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of police on his phone and says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense", he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail awaiting trial since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and repression we are witnessing from the Spanish government, he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crash into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after they drove their car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings reports damage to the gate and the house itself.
At some point, the car may have been hit by a crossbow.
Meng's shot secured Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
Livingston, who had been promoted from the lower divisions, shocked Rangers and awarded Steven Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team made it to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a Premiership game on the home turf this season and next Sunday they face Hearts first, who they are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended his division's undefeated streak to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to experience a loss.
Livingston didn't take his chances against the unassuming guests.
Holt's team should have been ahead of the goal a long time ago because his straightforwardness was causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but missed the goal, then Alan Lithgow slipped just short of Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
The hosts just had to watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could annoy the guests with standard situations.
And that's when the key goal came.
Against Rangers, a free kick was called and Livingston made a curve, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent Mengu, who ran the ball into the middle of the penalty area and scored.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated possession, but home defense was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was usually out of commission.
The same game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's legs and Lithgow missed another standard Livingston situation.
Livingston's penalty area was constantly being hit by the centers that the players were continually clearing, and two penalty kicks were also wasted after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another one on the arm.
The Livingston phenomenon is analyzed.
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They have been exceptionally excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and teamwork have hardly changed since their return to the top, but Holt deserves a lot of credit for the way the team has been bullying since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was formidable, leading a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert the entire time.
The Rangers are lacking inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't live up to those standards anymore.
Their end was weak  they only got one home run  and that should be a wake-up call for the Rangers because they're in the middle of the table.
Erdogan met with a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on a number of issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of people - many of them Kurds - were heard protesting against Erdogan, condemning his policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The counter-protests reflect the controversy surrounding the visitor, who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and cursed as an autocrat by others.
Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and busy Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and an ambulance soon arrived, but the man was dead at the scene.
The deaths come just months after another cyclist died about a mile from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in a hit-and-run on Childers Street.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses are on alternate routes and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in the riot
According to the Bureau of Prisons, six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and are still ongoing.
To handle the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialized guards from the Tornado Team were called in.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "In response to the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison, specially trained prison staff were deployed.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer behind bars.
Long Lartin Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden had resigned after an inmate attacked the hospital.
And last October, law enforcement was called into the prison after a major riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City
It's not unusual for a tropical low pressure trough to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa will sweep across the desert southwest and bring the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities like Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained their tropical storm or low pressure status!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 millimeters of rain, up to 150 millimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the Rocky Mountain center and the Great Basin, 25 to 50 mm are likely to fall, with local summits up to 100 mm.
For those not at risk of flash flooding, the dew could be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these showers may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States just hit a drought.
Server weather.com reports that more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least "extreme drought", the second highest category, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
Hurricane Rosa's path will first take it to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, will then move 400 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday morning, moving 12 miles per hour north.
Then the storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses its strength.
It's expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall will be expected, posing a high risk of flooding.
 In the area from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 mm, with up to 250 mm expected, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then travel as a tropical storm through Mexico northward, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, then passing through Arizona and entering southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause deadly tidal floods and debris flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and his condition is now stable.
Avon and Somerset Police say young men aged between 17 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officers are looking for witnesses who may have a record of what happened on their cell phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "tasted the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the Democratic Party's reckless and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has experienced the wickedness and anger of the Democratic Party" during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at her arraignment.
The president said on Saturday that the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's greatness and quality and courage that day.
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that the vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh was a confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm always on the move, he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump declared that the Democrats had opted for "resistance and obstruction".
A senior Republican adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia 's earthquake and tsunami , and the death toll is still rising .
Authorities said on Saturday that after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many swept away by huge waves that flooded beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu for a festival on Friday, but as night fell, waves as high as 20 feet [6 m] hit the coast, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they fell victim to the waves", BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it took cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that before it hit the coast, the tsunami was spreading at 800 km/h on the open sea.
He said that some people had escaped to the trees and survived the wave.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster relief agency show many destroyed buildings and businesses, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath rocked the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's tremors was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have made the tsunami wave worse.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter.
He said communications were completely crippled without any information from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area and that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse", the statement said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to inform the public that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though authorities said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media can be heard of a man on the top floor of a building screaming desperately to warn people on the street of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water will hit the coast, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications in the area around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city has been reopened only for the transport of aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paulo, where workers are hiding in tent shelters built in the courtyard of an office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, says Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began their sad disaster relief work, some complained that foreign workers with extensive experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only be brought to the disaster site once a national disaster zone has been declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", says Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", we can start international aid, but that's not the case yet.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami hit on Friday in Sao Paulo, friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be those miracles that would lighten the bleak stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, was training two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As someone who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden", she says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the hours after the paragliding community learned of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu who were attending the beach festival.
But instead of a couple of blue ticks, his messages ended with a gray mark.
"I think it means the messages haven't been delivered", he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee while refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
According to Detective Dennis McCarthy's report, the driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to deposit more money.
While he was doing so, another man ran from behind a Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was to be put into an ATM.
Witnesses reported seeing several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved.
If you have any information about the identities of the suspects, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name from  to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing: "Being formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time, and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is set to introduce his new album Yandhi.
She's replacing Ariana Grande, who cancelled her appearance for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him in addition to being a shortening of his current professional name.
In my opinion, "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, meaning "you", West made it clear earlier this year when he was talking about his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's changed from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye as a mere reflection of our good, our bad, our mess, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,
A number of other famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy at various times, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator Jay-Z also alternated between writing his name with and without a hyphen and in uppercase and lowercase.
Mexican President AMLO has promised not to use the military against civilians
On the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza pledged that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
At a time when the leftist student movement was spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly stipends to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the US government issued announcements about AI, even though the US as a whole has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China last year launched a plan to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI", says Lee.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order this month from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat America's top player in Othello, and later was the chief research officer at Microsoft and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee praised previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when there would be another to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, says Lee.
"The academic elite are not being driven out of China, but by corporations", says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring their top university graduates to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its AI efforts, Lee said.
"I think that PhDs in AI should be automatically given green cards", he says.
The State Council of China issued the New Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Council and other government organizations giving money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence this year to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Selection Committee.
And DARPA announced this month that it's investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it now invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
But the U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether the required 50 percent of voters will turn out to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, to join organizations like the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", says 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of any problems as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, down from 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters actually cast their ballots.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and pulls out chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not through the door of the servants", says Kavadarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%, much needed investment.
"I think a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said the result of the election would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could see a turnout of between 30 and 43 percent of voters , which is less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it must be 50 percent plus one voter.
A failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it took office last May.
Look, Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come through the whole of Brighton's defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took over Brighton's defence on Saturday, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguero's passing, his goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass from the Argentine striker in the middle of the field.
He's slipped between three Brighton defenders and got into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penalty area, he passed one defender and passed several others.
The next left-handed pass, he found Sterling.
The English striker put the ball in the penalty area back to Aguero, who passed Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right hand, with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero has a problem with his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We thought he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
The Sky Blues' opening lead in this Premier League game was secured by Sterling.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took the ball and then sent Sterling to the long board.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before it slipped off the court.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to come back.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to make the starting pitcher position for Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have a shot at the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card spot Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they're still looking to win their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for nothing, we can at least get started, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the other team is going to be playing with probably the most effort I've ever experienced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start Sunday, but they're reportedly leaning toward Scherzer pitching in a situation like this.
It would be Scherzer's 34th start, and he'd practice on Thursday and pitch on Sunday, when he's usually off.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks at a rally in West Virginia
The president has been indirectly commenting on the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in the midterm elections.
In November, everything we've accomplished will be at stake.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones. I'm not running, but we're always on the move, and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to seize power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the repulsion.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overpower to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not giving it to them.
He said the Democrats have opted for "resistance and obstruction".
And you see it over the last four days, he added, saying that Democrats are angry and mean and disgusting and liars.
He mentioned the most senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, by name, leading to a loud buzz in the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, what?
No, um, no, wait, that was really bad body language. Worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse opinion.
He's intolerant of those who express their opinions
When the Moment activists in my local party voted for my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome because they have expressed their views frankly.
My colleague in the House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in my admonition for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The announcement of Friday's Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East said we wanted the meetings to be accessible and productive.
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday nights were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, most meetings are not held in this way today, and the promise of kinder, kinder politicians has long been forgotten, if it was ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each view is assessed as acceptable to the leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who I had previously thought had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn around and take positions I would not otherwise have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public  and it doesn't matter what I say  there's a barrage of abuse on social media, calling for my resignation, condemning the policy of the centre and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never back down.
One of the aspects of this era of politics that I'm most disappointed with is how insulting is becoming the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinion, and with each motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
I've been advised many times over the last two years to stay away, not talk so much, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher's government, which had literally left my primary school classroom in ruins, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could possibly be surprised by my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would only say that with the country now sliding into Brexit, which will damage our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my main message is not to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recall or political pragmatism will deter me from acting in what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38  17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late fifths have distorted the final result a bit, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
Now they're at the top of the charts as the only undefeated team.
In the end, it was a superb defense and a better use of chances that helped the home side win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been through a lot in our fights and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, "All praise to Ayra, they took the chance better than we did".
Grant Anderson's fourteen-minute fifth, converted by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot got an unchanged five.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty and then scored exactly halfway through and converted a solo attempt, making it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, converted by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
Then followed a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the pitch on a stretcher, and when play resumed, Ayr again bounced on a Stafford McDowall five that was converted by Climo.
Under-captain Ayra Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose again used the extra players on an unchanged five from Bruce Colvin after a short, strong press.
The home side came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow for attacking Clim without a ball, MacPherson from the penalty box put the ball behind the advancing moulders of Ayra.
Climo turned, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught a kick from David Armstrong and sent a wing to Gregor Henry for the fifth home run.
The star of Still Game is starting a new career in hospitality.
It appears that Still Game star Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry, and it turns out he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he writes and stars in alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he's a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was interested in joining a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Inland Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol outside the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with cables.
A blue flag in the color of the ocean flies over public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by the slogan: "The sea is our right".
It's our duty to get it.
Across inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline that the country lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century war for resources  as well as a desire to once again roam the Pacific Ocean.
The yearnings are perhaps the biggest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice, due on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and calm and of course expects a positive outcome", says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the MSD ruling on big screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that  after decades of stalled talks  Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales  who faces a controversial re-election battle next year  is also keen on Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely to be favorable  and even if it were, it would not make much difference.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory to anyone and has said it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the MSD decision comes just six months after the last arguments were heard shows that the case was not complicated, says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not only failed to advance the cause of Bolivia, but perhaps slowed it down.
"The issues of access to the sea have been taken over by the current Bolivian government", says Zarate.
He adds that Morales's offensive rhetoric has weakened all remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will one day start negotiating again, but after this it will be extremely difficult to have a discussion.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia 'an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit,' he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales  still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America  use the sea issue as a political crutch.
'Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
Judgment is an opportunity to realize that we need to deal with the past.
North Korea says it won't denuclearize unless the U.S. can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rivals in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has been stuck at a dead end for more than three months ahead of a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says he is "plotting to hope" that the ongoing US sanctions and objections to the declaration ending the Korean War could one day bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris show shows that the latest trend of giant headgear will soon be arriving in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block out the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of fancy giant headgear for their spring/summer 2019 collection at a showcase that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
The exhibit piece from Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a wide brim that resembled feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included ornate melons, a witch's hat, and even pineapple  but not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have lip seams and are more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One resembled a scuba diver's gear with a snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you keep up the great fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that giant hats could be coming to fashion stores.
The oversized hats come from La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat that flooded social media has sent another huge creation to the fairground  a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that carries it.
A dark orange reef bag lined with reef reeds and fitted with a white leather handle was the showpiece of Jacquemuse's La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to be in fashion stores next summer. Given the designer's success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a long track record of academic success, and this continues in 2018 with further excellent test scores, with individual and group successes in sport, the arts, music and other community activities underlining this.
These schools have over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools  SCIS and strive to provide the best possible level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement tailored curricula, we see that modern languages are increasingly popular and in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes straight to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.
It's a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
The latest results of this year's exams show that languages are at the top of the charts, with independent schools having the highest success rates.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned a foreign language achieved the highest A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest A's were achieved by 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects of choice are given equal importance in the curricula of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers cite as problems in filling vacancies are poor language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are a must in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses, learning a second language will have the real advantage of being a life-long skill in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, specifically 15%, being French.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages taught.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, he will always have a choice of independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this point, there is no denying that languages are vital to the future of a country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will be making his first appearance in a Laker jersey Sunday in San Diego .
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James playing for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will be waiting.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a wave of campaign speeches tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly sites like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the vote to confirm his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump's speech start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at a hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, which has been highly-tense over sexual misconduct allegations, and the Senate confirmation vote is expected to be delayed a week before the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans pick up the pace ahead of the November election.
According to Reuters, Trump campaign organizers say the five rallies next week are meant to "energize volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House".
"Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who did not want to be named.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling today could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be followed by media from Pittsburgh.
Saturday will mark the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"For Morrissey, it's not a good sign that the president has to come to help him with the polls", says West Virginia University political scientist Simon Haeder, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed they have guts to fight to keep their hopes up for Sunday singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday's pairs may be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swing is a completely fictional sporting concept, but players really believe in it, and especially in competitions like this.
So where does the swing swing now?
"They were up six points and now it's four, so we're taking it as if the pendulum is moving a little bit towards us", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead and 12 to go.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel they have a little bit of wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, like the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal in the green and set an example.
The cheers intensified as his round continued as he managed a key punch to win the match, with Thomas two holes behind.
His putt, which won them the 15-hole match, met a similar roar that tells you the American team isn't out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game", said Spieth.
That's all any of these players left behind.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed main story of the Ryder Cup.
Weird but adorable couple from Europe, four out of four, and they can't do anything wrong.
"Mollywood was the only couple to miss a hole on Saturday afternoon, but missed Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning".
The flow and the way the energy flows both towards and from the stormy crowd confirms that these are the players destined to win Sunday, and that by the time the sun sets over Le Golf National, there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in a different hole.
But it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly worked with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A hole and two doubles in the top nine put the Spaniards and Swedes in a hole they never got out of.
But on Sunday, no one will be able to help you.
Two-pair-to-two-ball games are so fascinating when you get up close and personal with the interactions of people in a pair, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give each other, and the way that strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has been playing better as a team and had a clear lead until the last day, but this two-two game also showed that the US team has the stomach for a fight that some, especially the states, have questioned.
As we head into the final day of the Ryder Cup , Europe leads by 10-6 .
Europe will gain a healthy lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's two-on-two games 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly came close twice to beating the struggling Tiger Woods, set out to make four shots at Le Golf National.
The European side, led by Thomas Bjorn, who decided to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning's two-ball game with the American side having failed in the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four games, won two games, but couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they still beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more decisively in a 5&4.
Woods, who was out for two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 games in a two-ball doubleheader and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested from the morning's two-ball, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a two-by-one defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world number one and number three.
But Europe was not in this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris, all the way out on the line.
Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a two-ball game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to a two-game deficit, although as Furyk's defending side, it only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the best day in two days, it looks like Sunday's counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says it will under no circumstances disarm unilaterally and without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continued UN sanctions had deepened their distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told his annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see an appropriate response from the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, unilateral disarmament is not possible at all.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea for each step, his statement appeared significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization simply because Pyongyang had done so in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation first and is increasing pressure on sanctions to enforce its goals, and even opposes declaring an end to the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: If South Korea, not the US, had been a party to the denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile targeting of US soil was inevitable after the evil President Trump branded Kim a "missile man on a suicide mission".
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without pause until we realize complete, final, verified denuclearization
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly on the sidelines, and Pompeo announced that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't end well.
He left Pyongyang in July, claiming progress, only to be declared a "gangster" by North Korea within hours.
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle its missile site and also its nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he hoped for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course designed to teach them about getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has all its students sleeping more in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho studying all night, where students stay up and encourage themselves with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world's most prestigious university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of it, this girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were really seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of student lounges where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that students' behavior won't change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'studying all night' still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
Getting enough good-quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to prevent weight gain, since sleep deprivation switches the brain into starvation mode, so you're always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that was taken by one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the course all the way.
He hopes to take the next step by asking all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting an alarm for bedtime as well as waking up time, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers:
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mings' shot confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's side struggled to record their first win since a 4-1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave him eight points behind top-flight leaders Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck with seven minutes left in the half and the Rangers' lineup seemed without inspiration or determination to level the playing field.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third and just one goal behind Hibernian.
And there could be further problems for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently being hit by an object from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, who overcame Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took the Hearts point last week and would have been delighted as his well-trained squad strangled their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have controlled the hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only two minutes into the game when Menga first let Scott Pittman go into Alan McGregor's goal, but the quarterback buried his big shot.
Keagan Jacobs' long free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only attempt it at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed like there would be more hope than faith in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a 15 minute penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson swept the Colombian challenge off the table.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by a header from Lassana Coulibaly and a short shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's 34-minute opener may have been against the flow of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to take on Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took out Mengu for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action at halftime and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange was almost immediate, with the wing collapsing into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly fought his way through the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw the crowd into the exact kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he got tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned around again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger reader
And now a page from our almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and still growing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger scanner.
The science of the Geiger Counter became a pop culture staple, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What in God's name is that?
It's a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms being ejected by radioactivity in minerals.
Oh, yeah, now it's really popping!
HANSS Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and transforming them in the laboratory
Then they can see a protein that's common to many cancers and then they can inject it back into the bloodstream.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells recovered from ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, turning them into a laboratory so they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then be re-injected into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine".
HER2 controls the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells are taken from patients and trained to target cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, wearing his magician hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio of Saturday Night Live after a confused performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, "Ghost Town", in which he wore the Make America Great Again hat, he began spitting at Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
I talk to white people a lot, and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was against racism, I wouldn't be in America, he said.
SNL launched a parody show starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the rape charge of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to the audience that his headpiece was getting eaten up backstage.
I was bullied backstage.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat".
That's a bully!
They also said I was in the wrong place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on my Superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do".
Try love.
His comments only earned the buzz of the audience at least twice, and SNL members looked upset, embarrassed, Variety reports, and one person even said, "The whole studio went completely silent".
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing "I Love" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest characters: Thank you for putting up the DAW".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing".
But I do NOT want to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or promoting their art) who I believe represents and broadcasts an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us", she added.
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name to follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly known as Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the D.A.'s office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has ventured into toxic masculinity .
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series.
The 31-year-old actor, however, broke with the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen roles mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believes something is wrong and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of the Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he is "quite vocal" on the issue.
"At this moment, I personally feel, quite strongly, what has gone so wrong with masculinity?" he said.
❑ What are we teaching teenage men about the problem we see here now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity through its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is learned?
What do they teach boys on TV, on the streets, to feel that every man should have a side of this?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because young men have definitely changed for the worse.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not be starring in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel after the series was completed because he had had enough of the X-Men and the Horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of The Wild West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose was the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set of the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole life after that", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's love object for Jon Snow's character, in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Official figures show that more than 820,000 people in the country are infected.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which was a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been spread through some parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people a year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmission of disease comes from inadequate sexual protection during these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff would leak GOP senator data, using terms like "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff sent personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' Wikis.
A Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the accusations were backed by far-right scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that sources the posts is associated with Waters' office and has published information about Waters' staff members, Hill says.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", wrote Fleischer.
It suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They must not be defiant.
He must not question the prosecution's motives.
They need to be calm and not get excited.
Fleischer appeared to be likening Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff".
Johnny English hits the reviews again with a weaker spy parody of Rowan Atkinson.
It is now common to look for Brexit in every new British-themed film, which seems to be the case with this revival of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this brazen satire on how obviously bad a nation we are gonna be our new export opportunity?
In any case, this ragged, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face had his license to repackage things in a whole new way - that name more than anything else signaling that it was a wide comedy production intended for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
He's, of course, the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a big bite of the guy who sang the single tune in the Chariots of Fire speaker at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The character is also originally based on the traveller and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, and who left a trail of chaos behind.
There's one or two nice moments in this latest issue of JE.
I loved Johnny English approaching the helicopter in medieval armor and the blades of the rotor briefly ticking on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor feels rather under-dimensioned and strangely redundant, especially when serious film labels like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
The humor is more like it's meant for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy tramps are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gags in the person of Mr. Bean.
The continuing assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents in the field, much to the dismay of the agent on duty - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and biased figure who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this would-be Theresa May character as best she can, but there's not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every one of her active spies is compromised, she will have to put someone back on the job from retirement.
That means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a manager in some luxury establishment, but is also teaching a record-breaking lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering former partner Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man living with a submarine commander, a troubled figure who may be wasting some of Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin, packing assignments for Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's cyber crimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of farcical misadventures: masquerading as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking aboard the Volt luxury yacht; and English sets off pure anarchy by attempting to get inside the Volt house using virtual reality.
All the aces are definitely ready for this last sequence, but as kind and stormy as it is, it has a little bit of a kids' TV in it.
It's a pretty moderate thing.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matched his talent?
Labour denies that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan whereby Britons will work four days a week and be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings that come from using artificial intelligence (AI) to workers.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and plan to favor the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: The assessment of the measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a wish that fits into the party's stance on balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not our party policy and the party does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a business conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has stated that he is committed to returning the energy from anonymous CEOs and experts in utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not have to return to their overall stake, as the Labour government could implement "cuts" based on perceived guilt.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to set up ownership funds that would transfer 10% of the equity capital of private companies to employees who are entitled to annual dividend payments of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might have changed their minds
The FBI investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the office's findings could swing any Republican senators into campaigning for their support.
In an interview with Sunday's 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I told them I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusation came out, and he said, "You did this?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
But Graham 's decision is unshakable .
"I've already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would be a really explosive charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett has denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she mentioned could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City hosts the annual Global Citizen Festival, a music event that features a very impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The seventh annual Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to gather in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that promotes ending poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now, 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism - people who feel that by signing an online petition or tweeting, they will make a difference?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds provided have a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide so far.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition Project, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to 'helping children grow to their full potential', pledging $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice in the form of malnutrition a note in history said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Project, to a live concert crowd in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions that called on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on my website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: It will be a long and hard road - we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's New York City event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the navy to blockade Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may use the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from invading markets including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he allegedly said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with the help of our Navy, to make sure that the sea lanes are open and if necessary blocked, to make sure that their energy doesn't go to the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which is seen in the US as the "voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were practically the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to invest in or replace fuels, he said, while referring to Russia as a one-sided player with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russian, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back down from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "brain duct" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States took a stand with Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's largest industry organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to take a close look at the 2020 presidential race, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that after the midterm elections, she's looking closely at running for president.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top women's position", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'll take a closer look at the presidential candidate.
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm scared to death of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names being discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make his official decision in January, reports The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin is mentioning PTSD to Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being blacklisted in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through after he returns, may be for other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room", and she said of her son and other war veterans that they come back a little different, come back healed, come back and ask if there's any respect at all for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, give to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to new measures by the U.S. government that deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia issued a briefing in Washington on Friday to support the asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner, his sons and members of a violent gang abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations that face pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new measure "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle, said the short friend.
Lawyers also briefly argued that a policy that denies immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy and says they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, where the death toll has already doubled, race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the arid city of Palu.
Every minute, the ambulance brings in more bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, scavenging through the damp and trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals that had been destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude quake were paralyzed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, were resting at Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for ongoing severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was dragged into the wall collapse", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they 're all right .
US Ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the U.S. newspaper that focused on the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the paid subscription of China Daily to the Des Moines Register - the state's top-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said Reuters was another phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that manifests itself in the level of each other's imports.
China's retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a commentary in the Des Moines Register Sunday that China is now doubling down on this bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America's precious tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
In contrast, in a newsstand on a street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the dissonant views that Chinese people might have on China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is owned by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's leading newspapers had declined an offer to publish his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are abandoning their constituencies ahead of the election over Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn.
As many top Republicans defend Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn that the upcoming midterm elections will see a backlash, especially from women.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high, and most Republicans on record have already said they want to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be undone, said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, a Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a Senate hallway rally where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records", said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
People say it was high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among hesitant suburban women voters and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who may not like the president but often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault allegations against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, resistance might follow.
"It's a messy mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets the seat, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it", said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointing to a news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party during his time at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet and overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that's trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of this startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own personal online data warehouses or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in one browser and all at once.
What's unique about a personal online data store is that it's entirely up to the user to decide who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the purpose of the Inrupt project is to bring the resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some employees who work on the project, collaborated on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with Facebook and Google are not talking about going through a complete revolution where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We're not asking for their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in a media post published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during World War I
It was the centenary of the only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, never knowing that he had received Britain's highest military award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone to him at a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's triumphal act.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in very thick fog and heavy gunfire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he got to the front line and with "great courage" led the line forward before he single-handedly threw himself into the firefield and knocked out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918 just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something that I could never do, but also something that was humiliating.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann laid the wreath after a performance led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of the show", adding that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that many people give".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 instead of getting Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you waited all night to watch the bloated Bellator 206 only to be denied the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 items, including six on the main board, and was broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their match, viewers in the UK were stunned when the news was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some remained unmoved after staying up late for the fight.
One Twitter fan described the change to a children's show as "a form of bad joke".
"Government regulation says that at 6am, such content is not appropriate, and therefore children's programming must be aired", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, after being asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yes, you are.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they're working on a program that will engage viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think if I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it", Cooker said.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning and we can't make it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all of them were exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're gonna reduce it to five games instead of six... like we normally do... and we tried our best to keep our promise to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic diving champion Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality... but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that everyone was like him until he entered high school.
On the first Radio 4 Disc Desert Island Disc, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that the opportunity to become a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime regular host of the show Kirsty Young had a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first program, stated that he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it was not socially unacceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "Up until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherness have been the real things that have given me strength and power to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "Somebody", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone who might find out what his sexuality was like.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT rights activist and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "hit him unexpectedly".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who's 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you experience so much at such a young age" He was in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later of cancer "He said it was not easy to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said it changed his whole perspective.
"If you ask me last year, it would all be like 'I want to win a gold medal,'" he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father was not comfortable with the idea of him dying, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be in the first row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
A year later, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life... jumping in front of our home crowd at the Olympics, I don't know of a better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still made him goose bumps.

Mickelson, who was out of form, ended up on the bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson would have set a record Sunday when he played 47 Ryder Cup matches, but he had to fine-tune his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was sent off by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and foursome.
Instead of being the center of attention, as is often the case in the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day alternating between cheerleading and working on a play in a row that he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, so he's not an ideal choice for the narrow course of Le Golf National, where long, rugged terrain routinely punishes misfires.
And if the golf course itself isn't disturbing enough, Mickelson faces defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who, teaming with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down, had started 12 separate swords, avoiding a quick lead, Mickelson's stroke could have been absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and added nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, he patted me on the back, put his hand around my shoulders and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's so confident in himself.
He's a member of the House of Straw and he's been so helpful to these teams in the past and this week.
I guess I just didn't see it coming with two fights.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go that route.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Falde's record for most Ryder Cup Wests played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence on the team has brought some intangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and is a great team room companion", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun going to him this week, too, which was fun to watch.
It's more than just a game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a big lead going into the singles in the final days of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward ride.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came within a very close 141⁄2-131⁄2 lead.
"You have to always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only narrowly", said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to give Le Golf National a 10-6 lead.
So history and every member of that team has shown me that it's not over.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all those points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to try to win that trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I said I'd focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what to put on the other side  the best players in the world.
Bjorn, delighted with his players' performance on a complex golf course, added: "I could never have done it alone.
Tomorrow we're going to have another animal.
There's a whole lineup of individual performances tomorrow, and it's just too hard.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, your golfing skills are fully tested.
That's the message you have to give the players, get your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great upheavals, when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn, only to end up as the loser when Europe achieved the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to go all the way.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to start fast like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle fighters.
So we set up the setup and made sure the boys felt like, you know, like we were gonna do magic tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I went with the group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way", Bjorn said of his singles selection.
German new warship once again delayed
The latest German naval frigate was approved in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coastline, local media reports.
The commissioning of the lead ship Rheinland-Pfalz, an all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but difficult problems after delivery have made the fate of this ambitious project uncertain.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
Obviously, they'll be equipped with a high-powered cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and certain hidden technologies, like reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include long maintenance life  It should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home port.
But the constant delays mean that the advanced naval ships  that were supposed to enable Germany to send troops overseas  will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy ever returned a ship to its manufacturer after handover.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of fundamental "software errors and defects in the metal elements" defects that would have made the warship unusable in combat.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors , half the workforce needed on the Bremen class frigates.
It also proved to be significantly overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne ship Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects in the metal elements, the cost of the entire project  including the training of the crew is also a problem.
The price is said to have risen from the original €2.2 billion to a staggering €3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates have become particularly significant in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed "lacking deployable ships".
This representative stated that the problems were continuously compounded as the old ships were taken out of service but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were capable of becoming part of the navy's equipment.
The National Trust is listening in on the secret lives of bats
New research is underway at a bat habitat in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the research findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the whistling and the smallest brown long-tailed and aquatic bats at the botanical gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this bat habitat to monitor bat activity throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map and a report will then be published to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by different species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating a meadow, and best practice in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have been declining dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and land development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatments of building materials and cat attacks, can also pose a risk.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track insects and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens, and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, colony controls, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Residential manager David Thompson says that this is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a great bat area", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It highlights the importance of bat control before starting up any maintenance work on a property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one mother nest can kill up to 400 females and young, which can wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to lend a hand and help.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don't know about, how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo denies rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "fake news" and said people "want to make themselves visible" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
This Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, spoke in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers, calling the news "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to cash in on my name.
It's normal. I know.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine, said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel for unsubstantiated charges, which they describe as "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the private sector".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for moral damage in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel suite and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the casino where, according to court documents filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada, he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told her he was 99 percent "right" and 1 percent "failed".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for the sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was afraid of retaliation and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman claims she is now seeking to resume her proceedings because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo, at the time of the attack allegations, was a step away from joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for €100 million this summer.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the losses of carmakers
Britain will forever regret losing its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said delays at the border could cost jobs if no Brexit deal is reached.
The Burnston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see production stop at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnston.
Other carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without a deal as far as how cross-border trade works.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini car plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a just-in-time delivery basis, with parts from suppliers in the UK and EU being delivered for custom-built cars within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and spare parts shortages, according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have a part in stock for more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and would therefore halt production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans for a revival of future relations with the EU were precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.
"We need a deal.We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success but also the opportunity to be seized", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains.
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately come at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the works unions, said that the worries of union members are growing: I have experience that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back another week as the fight for the Supreme Court seat with Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Even if Trump fires the acting attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, Washington has been buzzing for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he showed up at the White House surrounded by news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid interfering with a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox news on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set yet, it could be this week, it might have to be moved another week, given everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always keep the media updated.
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10th.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were caused by aversion to the "theater" of television reporters, although she said, "I disagree with the fact that he's going to perform".
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more question and answer sessions than any president before him", she added without providing any evidence.
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be better than talking to me".
We're trying it, and you've seen that we've been doing it for the last couple of weeks, and there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre look to a gathering of reporters.
The Department of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland not to fear Brexit
The Department of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wishes them to stay on after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to defray the costs of settlement status applications from EU citizens working in devolved public services.
Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU are continuing withdrawal negotiations this summer, with a decision expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you.
So I want to reassure you how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and it is our fervent wish that you remain here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers outfielder Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics put Abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen and then put him on a stretcher and prepared him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the type/ extent of the injuries" were available at this time and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before Saturday's game, he had five total interceptions, which is 18 total for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property taxes when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters
Increased obligation to pay higher property tax will apply to non-taxable persons in the UK
It is estimated that the Treasury will be increased by £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will pay higher property taxes when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money going to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in property tax will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay UK taxes, and the extra money will boost the government's efforts to fight homelessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchase for rental purposes, can be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury is expected to increase its resources by up to £120 million a year.
Estimates say that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, driving down prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get into the home market.
Many affluent areas of the country  especially in the capital  have become ghost towns precisely because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property taxes to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the big building firms of keeping property prices high by taking land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing shortage".
Mr Corbyn has announced a fascinating series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to increase the powers of the committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I wanted to devote my efforts as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream so that each new generation has a better life.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape their lives here.
But it cannot be right to make it easy for non-UK entities and foreign companies to buy houses as hardworking UK residents do.
For many people, the dream of home is too distant and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their head is too real.
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to run Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to manage Scotland at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of rebuilding the north-eastern club, who are currently third in the Premier League, just three places below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that draws me back.
But the only way I could have this opportunity was if I was successful in running the club.
Ross's predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no anxiety about following such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down foreplay from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at that time would be measured by whether I could bring this club back to the Premier League.
"Because of the structure and equipment of this club, they are definitely in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him back, but I think I'd feel successful if I could get the club back.
Ross has only been in management for three years, having previously been assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and transformed St Mirren from a starting relegation to a championship winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he ever did in his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads, reminiscent of the time when Alloa took over.
I really believed that leadership was more my thing than acting.
It sounds weird because I was good at it, made good money, and enjoyed moderate heights.
But acting can be difficult.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through them in terms of stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good about leadership.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm doing it, I feel like I'm in my skin more than I've ever felt in my entire adult life.

The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of struggling British pubs but has put additional pressure on the restaurant chain.
The figures show that pubs and bars groups recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July  but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consultancy CGA, which produced the final reports, said: The stable sunshine and longer than expected England's World Cup attendance meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, with pub attendance up 2.8 percent but restaurants hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The bars and pubs that offer drinks have been doing the best so far, as have the restaurants.
Restaurants whose main source of income is food have also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from a leisure and hospitality analytics firm, said: These results are a continuation of a trend that has been ongoing since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, though the annual decline in sales of 4.8 percent will be especially painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer can't be a worse time for food-attracting business owners, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much needed relief.
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover in excess of £9 billion, an established industry benchmark in the sector.
One in five children has a secret social networking account that they keep from their parents
One in five children  aged just 11  has a secret social networking account that is hidden from parents and educators, research shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram accounts.
News reports have raised concerns about the posting of sexual content
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a main account that their parents knew about
One in five children  aged just 11  create social networking accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts sharing photos.
Reports indicate that there are concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "mainstream" account that their parents knew about, and they also had a private account.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that her teenager was encouraging others to rape her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletic Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the steering committee.
Doyle is the most decorated lightweight athlete in the world and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those at the helm of the sport like you, who will benefit from her far-reaching experience at the international level over the past decade.
Eilidh is widely respected in the Scottish, British and world athletics communities and we are sure that she will be a great asset to athletics in Scotland as a committee member, said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm thrilled to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be really beneficial and help run sport in Scotland".
An American who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, won a total of four gold medals, and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and I'm able to exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!
A milk pump that compares mothers to cows is making online comments
A vacuum cleaner company has divided online opinion with an ad that compares nursing mothers to suckling cows.
As part of the launch of the world's first silent wearable vacuum cleaner, consumer technology company Envi has released a music video with a hype that shows the freedom the new vacuum cleaner gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn full of hay with cows to a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I'm reaching, but you can't see any tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, I'm not reaching, here are my breasts".
The chorus goes on, "Pump, pump, I'm feeding the children, pump, pump, I'm feeding my sweet milk".
However, the advert, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a controversial response online.
The video has had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received mixed reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom said it sheds light on the dairy industry's "horrors".
Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth", says one commentator.
The Elvie suction cup is applied discreetly to the breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use it for a breast pump commercial for mothers who keep their babies?
Someone else added, "This commercial is completely off".
Opponents of the advert also appeared, with one woman admitting that she found the song "contagious".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breastfeeding.
I feel exactly like a cow when I suck.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's relevant.
It's a brilliant product, wrote one user.
Another added: It is an entertaining ad for mothers who suck their milk (often at work or to the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement to praise or curse the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women are shown dancing with discreet suction cups hidden under their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suckle milk report feeling like cows.
However, Elvie's vacuum cleaner is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and is nicely hidden in the breastplate, giving women freedom of movement, holding the baby, and even walking while sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: The Elvie vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight the sucking and all the challenges that come with it, while also showing the fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new sucker provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner has come to light.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers, designer Marta Jakubowski, showed up at the pier, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially as the tough rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration have made it harder to place unaccompanied children.
Most of the escorts were traditionally undocumented immigrants who were afraid of being threatened by the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people who applied for escort status for unmarried minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or sponsors' household members are in our country illegally, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we're going to continue to hunt them down, Mr. Albenze said.
According to asylum workers, officials have introduced new rules to require some children to appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days, in an effort to process cases involving children more quickly.
Many show up via video conference call instead of in person to make their case legal for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely he or she is to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, say asylum workers, reporting from the system over the past few months.
Advocates say that these concerns are heightened in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of child distress are more likely to go unnoticed because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time for emotional preparation or good-bye to friends could cause the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria has announced that the US, French and Turkish occupation forces will withdraw immediately.
During a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even as the country is in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also the acting prime minister, said that foreign forces are in Syrian territory illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they will be dealt with accordingly.
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Mouallem insisted that the war on terror in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and any illegal aliens.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
In extraditing the refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good for them to return and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that made the refugees unwilling to return.
'We have contacted international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns,' he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery assistance will be available to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last refuge has created an opportunity to move political discussions further.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections will soon take place.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to reviewing the articles of the existing constitution and issued a warning against action.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Donald Trump would have won the next election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, the impeachment and scandals had not prematurely ended his presidency.
In that case, it would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic presidential term finale in history!
So far, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average prime-time audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased cable television viewership to 3.5 million who watch the main nightly news.
"It's the heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the veteran writer of comedies and the show Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was voting for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he's funny", Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, a story set in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and benefit the global economy.
Alignment is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you're an informed citizen to watch a six-hour panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward uses "deep backup" resources for his book Fear, the $15,000 ostrich leather jacket of Paul Manafort (a garb of arrogance, as the Washington Post put it), and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' disgusting depiction of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm not gonna watch Super Maria the same way again, among other things.
"Part of what it does and what makes it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the documentary Pawn Stars about the NFL's rotating Trump show, which praises Kim Jong-un.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, 80 degrees outside on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked in, watching MSNBC and taping CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the line.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Money from outside flows into the narrowest domestic race of midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district has been experiencing an influx of funding thanks to congressional redistricting that has generated two incumbents vying for the same seat.
This recently led to the redistricting of suburban Pittsburg County by Democratic Republican Conor Lamb who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race for the new 17th District has sparked a fierce financial dispute between the main party's finance arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb name became famous in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts are giving the Democrats a slight head start.
America is considering fining El Salvador for its support of China, then backing down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was housed in a hotel in Panama until the partners sued to evict Trump's organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the US diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
With internal negotiations continuing, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following similar talks last year that were seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the US.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively complete any sanctions considered for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of a conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the administration's signal to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate, which was described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the condition of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the government executive, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of the study
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from the special commission on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's exercise of his right, which is now abundantly documented in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's investigation is also reportedly looking into whether Mr. Trump's campaign had a secret agreement with Russia to attack our election.
If there were a change of Congress, Mr. Trump would have to answer to that body, as he prepares to re-enter the electorate, and he would likely end up with a jury of his peers.
That's a whole series of "ifs", and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice to make that will affect how long the suffering continues.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the Western powers would stand up and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long, bloody flights that followed.
History revolves around these critical moments that accelerate or slow down the relentless march of democracy.
Americans now face several similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been upset ever since a report said he proposed secretly to fire the president last year, speculating he was unfit to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times' version of events is inaccurate.
How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling sexual assault charges and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in midterm for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long dark night.
But I believe we will not fail, thanks to a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on a swastika table on the Sabbath.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria would give them a big chance of advancing from Europa League Group G after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal have a quality team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could make a difference, and we got a point.
We might have had a chance to replicate it at the end, but overall, the draw was fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we got better and we were better again.
Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it's going to be tough because they played well in the last game, but with the fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and it'll be good.
Last year was pretty rough, with all my injuries and the changes at the club, but I feel pretty good about it here.
The team is strong and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training is great.
I hope we can build on this now, put past last season behind us and be successful.
Women are worried about saving for retirement
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few talked to their families about it.
About half of those in the national study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be looked after by a family member, but they're not willing to talk about it", explains Holly Snyder, vice president of a national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving unless you first let them know what you want.
Discuss where and how to get care with your counselor and family, as these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
For example, you can finance long-term care by using traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these costs, or self-insurance using your own funds  while you have money.
Make your own legal documents: avoid legal battles while you can.
You will appoint a health care representative, who will be a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate yourself.
Also consider writing a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your aging parent is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake, but what are the names of the doctors who treat you?" asks Martin.
Where are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan in hand.
A man in Ilfracombe was shot multiple times with a blasting grenade.
A man was walking home from a night shift when he was hit by several air-dropped shots.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise, officials said.
With communications down, the rescue units were unable to get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Pala that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the Donggala Regency, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, tsunamis have hit Pala and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck western Donggala in 1996 and claimed nine lives.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here's a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that sweeps along the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hits Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic as it reminds people of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami formed this time, but more than 100 died from falling buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when his female friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin's phone was taken away.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, the CTUU reports.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he stated that he felt "absolutely innocent" when questioned about his testimony.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's had to face criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack was reported to the police by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, violating domestic violence reporting and drug-impaired possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by war veterans groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck directly on the island of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of the disaster have surfaced on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding an extraordinary death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullah Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. It's an exceptional sentence that hasn't been imposed on a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly attacked a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck to sweep pedestrians and cyclists.
To defend the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted multiple injuries. This is how the terms of the death penalty intent are defined in a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both of those numbers would mean the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 felony counts, including murder for racketeering, a charge commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and preparation", the prosecutors claim, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as heinous, cruel and perverse.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Laure Decadto, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco", is stated in the intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court handed down the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were put in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching Islamic State videos on his phone.
Police also released that he also requested that the Islamic State flag be displayed in the hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed in the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's legal team has previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
According to Conservative MPs, he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize the people's army during today's protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must 'feel the pressure from Eurosceptics'  as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested, he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The sitting Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that Britain would be out of it by now if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the problem Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks was further highlighted by the EU-Remain Conservatives who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan under attack from Brexiters, Remainers and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they will continue to seek a deal with Brussels regardless of the consequences  and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said the Leave Means Leave group is meeting in Solihull, where he's going to "screw Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out today", he declared.
MEP Wellingborough added: 'I support Brexit, but we have to give up on Chequers.
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight the world wars to be obeyed.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely misguided.
Conservative Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: 'I'm simply saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and he is not liked by our party members or our activists who are currently filling the streets to get us elected at all.
Forget about the Chequers and start listening.
In a stern message to Mrs May, he says: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said Conservative politicians must "get into a bit of a bind" if they want to betray their 2016 referendum decision.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class", he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we stand here today to tell them, 'we won't let you do that.'
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are now mobilizing the people's army of this country, which has secured us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud self-governing United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners for the Conservatives against Brexit after the party's launch over the weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over concerns about the security of the party's app after the conference opened.
'These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for borderless, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
"This whole thing is a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "consider seriously" running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's campaign co-chairman in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's been at the center of speculation that she might stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the top.
A suspect in the shooting of LSU's Sims has been arrested.
Baton Rouge, LA police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyton Simpson, at the 11:00 a.m. ET news conference.
A video of Friday's shooting has been released requesting the identification of the man captured on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot in the early hours of Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to the head", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to moving around the scene, having a gun, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was taken into custody without incident at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-6, Baton Rouge-raised Sims played in 32 games, 10 of them last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes close to the title of world champion as team management hands him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas finished Saturday's qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team management would play a big part in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pit lane first, allowing Hamilton to overtake the cars circling the tail of the pack, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver entered the pit lane a lap later and lined up behind Vettel after the start, but Hamilton started ahead and in a close race the Ferrari reluctantly had to leave the inner track clear to defend the double manoeuvre in Turn 3.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in the lead at the end of lap one on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race, holding onto his original tyres for as long as possible to focus on a quick finish and be able to take Kimima Raikkonen's fourth position.
He finally went into the pit lane on lap 44, but he could no longer pick up pace for the remaining eight laps and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like the perfect gentleman.
"The team did a fantastic job and the prize is the first two places", Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for insisting she didn't publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead stated that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil and disgusting and liars.
"One thing that could happen, and a beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in Senar, is when you see the anger, when you see these people, how angry and evil and disgusting and lying", he said.
When you look at the press release and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you responsible for the leak?
Remember her answer... you published the documentary , oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I did not.
She didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, no, no, he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations or release information about the case", Feinstein told the crowd, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I did exactly what she asked.
But her words did not seem to be believed by the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that's really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but either way, that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president has continued to defend a Supreme Court nominee who has been accused by three women of sexual harassment, and has suggested that the Democrats are using the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to take back power by any means available.
You see the vile, the heinous, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to kick into the ground to get back to power and the helm", Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
The elite league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have recovered from Friday's Premier League defeat to the Belfast Giants with a rematch win at Dundee on Saturday, which ended 5-3.
The Giants quickly took a two-goal lead with the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to tie at home before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard then equalised for Dundee again, with two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen securing their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Premier League this season for Adam Keefe's side, who managed to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth time the two teams had met this season, with the Giants dominating all three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with an assist from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford credited an assist on Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first quarter was wild as Sullivan got the home team back in the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie to tie the game at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went into the first half with only a lead as he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again managed to tie the game-winning goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's joint work later in the second quarter helped Nielsen swing the lead to Dundee for the first time in the game, and the same player secured his team's lead in the mid-final third.
The Giants, now down four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller died to allow hundreds of people on board to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died trying to get a plane with hundreds of people on board to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a massive earthquake triggered a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks flooded the area, trapping many people in the ruins of Palu.
But even as colleagues of 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung fled for their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the wildly swaying control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He stayed in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia's ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter transport from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the chopper reached Pala.
"Our hearts are broken by this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities have expressed concern that the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster response agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is restricted.
"The death toll is still rising as many bodies remain uncovered under the wreckage and many are still missing", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves in devastated Pala have reached 20 feet high, and a mass funeral is being held in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are bringing aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing more bodies here every minute.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night and complete all tasks that are necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a lagoon on one of the Pacific islands of Micronesia now reports one person missing, initially saying that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane went into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that a total of seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment Saturday and all were in stable condition.
However, the cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had run over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That was really good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight crew panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby on dock repairs helped rescue the passengers by using an inflatable boat to carry them to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that a total of 111 people have died in crashes involving aircraft with PNG registration plates over the past two decades, but no accidents have occurred with Air Niuguni.
An analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded its testimony Saturday in the case of a man repeatedly convicted of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert testimony in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury outlined a scenario using cell phone records from the 29th defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers's company the night of her death, contradicting his earlier testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When cell phone records showed he spent the night with Chambers, he said he was with his boyfriend, Michael Sanford, who was later visited by the police.
Sanford appeared in court at the cathedral and testified that he was out of town on the day in question.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers for about two weeks on the day she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to go before a jury later that day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to address negative perceptions of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based band High Breed claims that hip hop has moved on from its beginnings with political messages and addressing social issues.
So they want to go back to their roots and re-popularise hip hop consciously.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have already seen a recent revival thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
New York City schoolteacher sues a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York City governess is suing a couple for their discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mistakenly sent text message from her mother, calling her "another black text".
The couple denied being racist and likened the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when on her first day at work in 2016, she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"Another black woman", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
When she realized her faux pas, "anxious" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing tutor, an African-American, had been doing a really bad job and was expecting the Philippines instead, reported the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for being fired and is seeking $350 a day for the six-month commitment she was initially hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not what's done", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The twins, however, returned the blow by saying that they were not racist but that terminating Mrs. Maurice's employment was the appropriate measure because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after the insult.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We're not racist, her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you entrust your child to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Oh, please.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "blackmail" and stated that his wife was caring for only a two-month-old baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you hit on someone like that?
"That's not a nice thing", said the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, a jury on social media quickly convicted the pair for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of the Paddington stories were concerned that readers would not identify with the talking bear, recent reports show.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told reporters: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes who's reading it for the first time, even before it's published.
But it's very amusing to know now that we know the enormous success of Paddington Bear.
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a "sweet and bitter" point after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of her family", she added that her father was very proud of his final achievement.
"He was a quiet man, never a braggart", she said.
But because Paddington was such a real character to him, it was like having a child who had achieved something you could be really proud of.
I believe that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Although it was all his creation and imagination, he always tried to give all credit to Paddington alone.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me it was really bad and that she didn't expect to get out of it", said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, saying she was gonna die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be right there with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly lost its effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything closed down.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without revealing the difficult test she was undergoing.
"No one knew", she said.
I kept my head down, tears running down my face the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an overwhelming sense of understanding for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Grief-stricken women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending out postcards from Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to reach out for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and as a result, he took his own life at 18.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up any room.
However, before he died, he left his job because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling's still body after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about how this will affect his life".
Mrs. Davis designed the postcard to let people know that they have people available to help them and that they can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don't sit still. You have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me anything about feeling down or depressed, nothing at all", he explains.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
The worst part was on Christmas Day when the kids opened their presents, he didn't even look at them, nothing.
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that they had to get over it gradually: "This kind of thing can really break a family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we might get something he was really asking for - a limited-time, limited-scale investigation - we might bring a little unity to the table", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "fall apart" because both sides would be buried in their positions after the partisan attack.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their resistance is well timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if the Republicans do as badly as expected, it will fundamentally weaken their efforts to put the man they want on the Supreme Court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI makes their report?
The Senate will vote on it, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it's unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can secure at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would have allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees under Kim has declined.
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since the beginning of Kim Jong-un's rule seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker says.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year  compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further stated that this is due to tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of smuggling required at the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees today are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South  which are still technically in a state of war  have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This was the case at the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms of cooperation on the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US of not making any progress on sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remark in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if any woman ever performed this kind of theater, they would call her hysterical", Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both in their teens.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and choking while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying their accusations against him were "grotesque and coordinated attacks" by organized liberals who failed to move on from Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he showed a bias against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he's leaning on the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi said no when asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's impeachment if he was confirmed even if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll tell you this: If he doesn't tell Congress the truth, then he's not only ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court, but he's ineligible to serve on the court he's now serving on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential courtroom proceeds on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings leading up to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would overturn any Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to walk into a courtroom and expect us to just say, 'Wow, that's beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to master it.
After months and years of verbal abuse, she couldn't get over it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She goes on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a director somewhere, and she told me that she cries when she's angry, but she developed a technique, which is when she's angry and she starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.
But I'm angry.
And so she kept on doing it.
And I think that's great.
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, in part because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in a male-dominated office, and I once expressed my inexpressible anger through tears, but an older, always cold manager, who I was always a little bit afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found there was no reason why she couldn't explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
There were already seven other candidates running and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
But because the campaign was running late at the time, she couldn't keep up with the crowdfunding, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million in crowdfunding.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does he think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally run the campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions  as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger over sexism that she choked on anger.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder said of the press reaction to her.
And you may have noticed that my main sponsor was the Kleenex Company.
I remember thinking, what would they say on my tombstone?
I cried?
Why a Sino-US trade war might be good for Beijing
The initial wave of the US-China trade war has been deafening, and while the battle is far from won, experts say the rift between the two countries is in Beijing's long-term advantage.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
However, most of the most significant escalations have been seen this week, with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods being announced, effectively taxing half of China's commercial exports to the US.
Beijing has responded each time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to 10 percent of $60 billion in U.S. imports.
China has been trying to repay the US with the same coin, and it's unlikely the world's second largest economy will get down on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to go back to normal, it would be a concession to its demands, but publicly submitting to American demands would be utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts believe that if Beijing can play its cards right, a U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run, because it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The reality is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that trigger an economic twist in both countries, which is far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
Today, the situation in the territory is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as are the unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomes any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He has been involved in the repression of the Taliban and the repression of the Taliban.
Europe responded strongly to victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Euria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of trouble in France.
The U.S. now has its sixth straight loss on European soil, and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tour, then blew a waterball on three sets of 16 holes to give Francesco Molinari the win.
Italian golfer Molinari then shone in all his rounds, becoming one of 4 players to achieve the best 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5-4 by the lowest rated European player, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
World's highest rated player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who was apparently playing in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the overall European player of the year with 25.5 points scored in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, that I got the cup back.
"It's all about the team, I'm glad I could help", Garcia said after the European Championship.
He handed the trophy to his compatriot John Ramp, who on Sunday defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, matched only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend trying to find a fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who all put on top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they really fought.
We really warmed the hearts of Europe this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna regroup and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I was able to captain them.
I really need to lose weight.
You've outwitted us.
Red tide update: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties.
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to an overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, flower water spots are now being reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties  indicating a decreasing concentration.
The blooming waters of the red tide stretch about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
Spots have been spotted about 10 miles offshore in Hillsborough County, but there have been relatively few spots in the past week.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there were moderate concentrations reported off the coast or in the open sea in Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in the open sea in Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations in Manatee County, low to high concentrations off the coast or in the open sea in Sarasota County, low to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations off the coast or in the open sea in Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation is still present in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation was reported in northwest Florida last week.
