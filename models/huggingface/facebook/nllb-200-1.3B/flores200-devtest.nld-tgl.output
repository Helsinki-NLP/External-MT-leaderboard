When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it'll be sent back immediately.
The satellite was shot into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need to have a huge rocket that is over 100 feet long.

There are medium-sized felines among those medium-sized prey foods, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.

their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has so they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.

The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats), and are very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and have five times as much traction as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.

The ocelot's favorite food is small animals, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds when they can, and the ocelot almost exclusively hunts animals that are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They have excellent night vision and can move around very subtly, hunting for prey by integrating with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes detached from the large population from which they originate (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies are present, so the new population has to change its position or adapt to face the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population hasn't changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also started to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance, you can't call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and it simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plant produce oxygen which humans breathe and they take in carbon dioxide which humans breathe out.

You might think after the movie National Treasure that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
t is based on a misconception that there is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.

So it looks like the designation was just added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.

nall, the most common still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.

35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are equal to or a close approximation of this image ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is widely abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple directive which makes the image dynamic, yet clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This is how you divide the image vertically and horizontally into threes (see example).
At this time in European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.

From the king to the common man, his all-pervading power affected everyone.

UK imposed a sea blockade on Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to deliver vital supplies to military and civilian personnel, but this blockade violated the generally accepted international law which has been enshrined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that entire parts of the ocean are sealed off, which is dangerous even for neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestrained undersea warfare.

After World War I, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.

The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the notion that the land belongs to its inhabitants rather than to a single leader.

The same goes for the army, where rank is no longer based on class, but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class to revolutionize in other countries.
Muhammad was intensely involved in matters above earth, often going to a cave for meditation that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Noor Mountains.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain tops on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find it once inside the cave there is total isolation.
All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There's very little to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.

At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles to the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance much of the cost and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
US imperialism was based largely on the huge profits from the long exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know what was the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era in which this happened is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).

Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a path that for the most part goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some may say that the arrival of the automobile automatically leads to the building of roads.



In the Romanticism, geography shaped the individual and over time, customs and cultures emerged from this geography, forming a harmonious society and being better than the arbitrary imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.

Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.

Self-sustaining agriculture is agriculture where sufficient food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

Subculture allows for the bringing together of like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, thus giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.


one of the most widely used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, adversity or intentional abuse during their upbringing.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children' Some wolf children have been imprisoned by humans (mostly their own parents) and sometimes abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical limitation.
Treatable children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A wild child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behaviour similar to the behaviour of the animal that has raised the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
project-based learning should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, for example, a teacher is a form of support, but the paper clip man in Microsoft Office is also.
There's a virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that might be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
no child should be raised in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for and where they cannot develop, and yet this is happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The goal of foster care is to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
Internet is a combination of interpersonal and mass communication.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in terms of the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
"Learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'persistent relationships' when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to remarkable findings in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is stated that nobody can recognize a lie by merely paying attention to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, described how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Through mutation, new genetic variation is added; through selection, this variation is eliminated from the pole of expressed variation.

A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can get the amino acids needed from the plant sources found there.

The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they're cooked, they're hard to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easy to digest, but it also contains a very high amount of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.

Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall back to sleep within a short time (1060 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock which brings you back to your consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room. This way you have to get out of bed to turn it off.

The amount of inner calm a person has versus the amount of stress a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Each person is able to achieve satisfaction and total peace.
anyone can be or be their mind, and only your own stress and negativity stands in the way of that goal.

TibetanBuddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundaliniyoga, meditation and a practice of universal love.
Yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, are used to generate the energy of Kundalini yoga.
The essence of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Using the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and the consciousness is brought to an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in WWII, a cooperation between the USSR and the USA was established. When the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel.
The former allies were facing each other two years after the war ended, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years and proxy battles would take place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
Polish defense forces held out only until 17 September 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.

transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of the navy is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while actually impeding the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods.
The US tried to get men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to the British, and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German Navy tried to stop this traffic at the same time, using mostly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would have probably fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.

In ancient times, cultures and tribes began keeping them so that they could always easily obtain hair, meat, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other pasture, and were then guarded by goat herders, as was the more familiar shepherd, often a child or younger. Today, the same approach is still used.

Though horse railways consisted only of a rails of planks, the horses had to run faster and move larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult-to-travel roads of the time.

This soon became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were laid.
The first form of transportation we know about is walking, and people started walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus emerged.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
In fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, bipedal specialization is found.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement, or even take action to mitigate future suffering in some way.

manipulation of data encoded in binary digits is the basis for almost all computers in use today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open-box medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific EHS instructions for that specific poison.
This group of insects is formally called "worms" by entomologists.
The term comes from a centuries-old association with bedbugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both red carpet bugs and bed bugs are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in the nest or the house of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the primary neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.

A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests, or that of their child.
These couples may choose to give their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
To discover how the world works using the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.

Naturalists and philosophers turned to classical texts and especially to the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live by periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to periodic external signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are being given.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
two experiments were conducted. one experiment was done where the DNA in the bean was marked with radioactive phosphorus and the other experiment was done where the bean protein was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are heritable. Other mutations can cause cell death or can cause cancer.

On the ground, you can hunt, fish, take pictures, observe birds, visit parks, and study the ecosystem.

Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between individuals.
n't it's difficult to study the traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.

Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from enemies and to find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a greater number of small places for predators.

The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.

That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.

Today, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a punch-cutter.
You might be wondering what's going to happen to the keyboard once something new comes out.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy wagon pushing a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they fall apart at the slightest or smallest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rocks. The crust is the outermost layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.

Content theories are about finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
They want to explore the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need pyramid and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory.

Virtual teams should meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are slight differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
often more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports."Invisible team" also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the goals for putting organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity are revealed when all available resources are effectively used within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organisation, management must encourage a culture where innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning are central.
Angel (2006) suggests that organisations can perform better with a continuum model approach.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This allows for the narrowing of the research area and the collection of more accurate data.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
