Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers, a widely held hypothesis, but it provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-chestnut on the upper side, with a light or orange color on the lower side.
The discovery also provides insight into how birds' feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rahis, but exhibit other characteristic features of feathers  beards and barbels  researchers concluded that the rahis was likely an evolutionary development that emerged after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature control or impression. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not chicken puff.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not the fledglings of a chick.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured over 20 people.

Luminosity and rotation are used combined to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered the presence of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant is "very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate".
It's possible that some patients contracted the virus in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least 2 were hospital staff.

They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of some large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they represent deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a somewhat technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to be witnesses at all stages of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated: We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in front of the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She was held in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have decided that publishing the photographs can be harmful.
'Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that 'journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about the suspects.'
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is charged with criminal prosecution, has told reporters that it will not make any further comment at least until the charge is brought.
According to the leak, the document will address the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants drawn based on pre-war borders in the Middle East since 1967.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims, after the signing of the agreement, to have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence for a period of five years only.
The hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters, the test was monitored and its effectiveness was subject to evaluation.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Hunters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited from the Sport Hunters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety briefing and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There were approximately 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (MECI) stated that it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company said were "not serious".
The Minister responded, saying that the delay on Apple's part is truly regrettable.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management has stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has declared there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, the photos were replaced by an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature labor in his spare time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestler brothers brought her a tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman.
Dustin Runnels, nicknamed the Golden Powder, commented that Moon was as eccentric as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place.
Out of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her view Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of those polled agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication needed to control the pain, which is forbidden during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people verified the discovery before the beginning of February, using various combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supply to the earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing "political nonsense and foolishness".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and lowering carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, as opposed to older systems based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
There are no additional means of transport, surface trains do not stop at Wembley and parking and public transport facilities are not available in the area.
Concerns over the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, in the absence of the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's quince, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus quince, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of designs. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with your clean, wet hands, form a ball of them.
The moisture present on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange feeling and lead to the formation of some kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every home, attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to us, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket, 100 feet high, to carry a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is that it has given us a much simpler and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-ranging cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche; each cat has its own role to play, so it's not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families are composed of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and chicks.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals with surprisingly lion-like behavior (but not other big cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump for great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only felines that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds, and almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected, and they hunt by camouflaging themselves in their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) gets isolated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return back), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we can no longer say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, exhale it from the lungs).
Plants produce food by the sun, by photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, having nothing to fear but other mosasaurs.
Its long spines had over 70 sharp blade-like teeth, along with an additional set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing in its path escaped unscathed.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
They also attack anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could have withstood them.
While much of their cuisine would be unfamiliar to us, the Romans also had some odd or unusual festive dishes, which included boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a perch.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting down, rich men liked to have banquets where they sat on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that arrived in Europe, America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just the rails that faced the street; houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was a little bit colonized. In the Scandinavian saga, it says that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found the Greenland and called it Greenland.
But whatever his findings, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read: Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776. The text appears inverted, at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at its inception the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was kept in rolls.
So the marking was probably done simply for labelling.
The Z-Day landings and the fighting that followed had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was run by the French from Vichy, who were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American forces with the Free French had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is cognate with the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in some way the size of society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  Congress being its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to override laws and tax rates between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the island groups that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is, geographically speaking, an archipelag.
The beginnings of Taiwan go back a long way, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which had ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the digital camera's image sensor formats.
The somewhat confusing 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the frame into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power has affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money funds specifically exist for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the principle was really being followed.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law provisions enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unrestrained submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifist and isolationist.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different time periods; each stage of China or each family holding power represented a distinct dynasty.
The best known such interval was the Three Kingdoms period, the 60-year interval between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were bitter wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist one, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
So did the military, because instead of the armed hierarchy based on class, they now based on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the mundane, and he often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as Hira, located on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it's there, because once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful skies above and the surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, is home to several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, caves, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' mark looks like a 'V' and the 'down' mark looks like a cap or a square with a missing bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. the part where you grip the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward bowstring usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bowstring is louder and more determined.
Feel free to mark your own directions, but remember that printed directions for the arches are there for musical reasons and normally, must be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob shouting and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the frightened queen's eyes.
The war expenses of the United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to support much of the cost and interest of the bonds put out on behalf of the Philippine government by the banking houses on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people have been the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events unfolded is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the epoch in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is governed by an inherent logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence and that technology, in turn, has effects on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A high number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread by 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices more valuable than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine Oriental culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of that period was that, following the Crusades, people started to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecologically sound system that uses preserved seeds from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel held to a set of societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The distinguishing characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "unruly" or "savage". Some savage children have been kidnapped by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to parental rejection due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or run away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The feral child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely those of the animal that nursed it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or site method is not a learning method but rather a tool that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scales can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of a scale, but so is the little man-painter in Microsoft Office.
Virtual schemes are embedded in software, serving to interrogate, provide clues and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in family care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they're deprived of food, love and education, but there are.
We perceive the family care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family care system needs to provide safe housing, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable health care.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of the children that were not covered in the home they were previously in.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The other distinct features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing types of use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can be observed whether a person by the mind correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause each generation to have the direction of variation dominated by one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans has a hard time meeting its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (forks, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should not be surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process by which you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period to fall back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without waking you fully.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it across the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace that a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and everyone has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has also added the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The basic principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini (enlightenment) energy is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process and culture led to the two countries distancing.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and be fought in earnest, by delegate armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became useless almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were mobilized creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting both goods and people from one side of the oceans to the other.
Traditionally, the Navy's role has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the more recent and notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
The goat may have first been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Cultures and tribes in ancient times began keeping them near their homes for easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasturelands, usually under the care of young male goats, often children or adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more irregular roads of the time.
The crossbars were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it was eventually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band on top.
This became a widespread practice, but the iron led to the faster wear of the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were produced.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossil Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years old, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now because of overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten note, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press, located a few blocks away.
 During the night, between 150 and 200 babies were made, known as  Dunlap postures.
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But in birds, you can still see many of the same features as dinosaurs.
They have slotted feet and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of two values, 0 or 1, and the designation of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "thinker" is used by entomologists to refer specifically to this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient resemblance of bedbugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Both killer beetles and bedbugs are nestlings, adapted to life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works using the scientific method, which is the method applied in most scientific research.
It's not the only one however, experimenting and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have made extensive use of classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West awoke detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in support of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, marking either the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-type cells can be passed on to children, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organized around nature exploration attracts interested people to visit natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be to visit, photograph and learn more about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small country settlements to their workplaces, passing others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or bridge collapses are rare in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such discontent, why do they fail every day? Is it because transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Traffic flow studies are unfortunately difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to remain within reasonable constants; consequently, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to relate the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to begin to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to more easily evade enemies and to find food and mates to mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying over eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some points six miles wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical construction prowess.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which by that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the Vatican's inhabitants are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known since ancient times about some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to mine using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - water, earth, air, and fire.
He was more of a recollection of the four states of matter, in the same order: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloy is actually a combination of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You'll see that some alloys can also include small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Sadly, as more modern writing tools became available, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to hold a sharp pen.
You can't help but wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill, the splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick nearby and 100 km thick at the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in the higher elevation areas.
There might be more lava nearby, because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying what attracts people's attention or what makes them happy.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into adulthood.
These theories study what makes people want to do what they do and what in their environment can make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain one of the boys (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who think they have to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
And oftentimes, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The role of virtual team members is often to provide a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which might not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be unleashed.
As a result, the process by which an organization works as a unit to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to get organizations to achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology represents physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, and as such, allows the narrowing of the research area and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that were previously unseen.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulations that help us understand the processes that go on in our minds.
While AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it has also been used in some software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and oftentimes, a teacher would love to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, and the previous versions are kept online, to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's written expression.While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to make efforts to improve his writing and to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to be more aware of the world around them.The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the ordinary school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students to think more analytically and critically; by responding actively to material found on the Internet, students can define their own position in the context of what others have written, as well as shape their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka District and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Larger portions further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated nations of France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels should state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's good to wear a wedding ring, but don't make it look expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed, etc.
Be firm when you reject a man, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Marines, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it and called it Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajine, ceramics, pillar objects, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of trinkets, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the settlement, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, visiting outside the city requires an informative effort to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climbing of the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
The boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to travel through Goma. The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Alongside its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by the desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special of Henry Louis Gates, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the country's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists see as the focal point.
The display of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a brilliant bar chart that is enhanced by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For some of the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon, across the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed onto reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonizers and they took over and therefore for anyone looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps, however - they also contain some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about one-third is afloat covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has become a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses that connect districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 273 feet, it is 1,100 feet (378 m) long and has two 12 foot (3.5 m) wide strips.
The free-standing height of the underpass is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called The Gigantic Province of the Indians, was born in the 16th century after the Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has maintained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value is set as the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency will probably be accepted; please contact the owners to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland liras outside the country, so you have to exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and in the summer months, temperatures often reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how tame it may seem, the bison, the moose, the bear, and almost all other large animals can attack a man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them their space.
In addition, be aware that the odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so it would be wise to avoid strongly smelling food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan state of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a naval confrontation of sad memory in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of Tupua supreme chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is situated between two harbours, the most famous of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore (North Harbour District) beaches, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the Mission Bay and St Heliers market suburbs of central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide array of shops arranged along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
You can find a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian would be better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you have fears you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino comes full of cream (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are peppered as price, but very good.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep you booked if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you're gonna have to get there early to catch a camping spot near the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, be aware of the cabin's location, as navigation through the ice creates an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruise from Saint Petersburg includes time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent by customers and the money spent by them. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment deals to keep the mood going and the guests staying in.
Some bars offer drinks on a free-range basis, but drunkenness affects judgment, and good players know the importance of staying sober.
Drivers driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes should take into account the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you can on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short period of time, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or by viscolite or condensation, or by the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic runs for the most part uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps Africa's premier tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to trips on land to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially those on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll be able to see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, a walking safari, or a walk) consists of hiking for either a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked flight tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be facing a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, coronavirus cancellation policies were not expanding until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Stepping on wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have a hammer and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not like to wear combed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material overheat (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, more minutes are required.
Filters vary in their efficiency, and if you're concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them at home.
Pests can cause food spoilage, irritation or, in severe cases, allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infection.
Infectious diseases per se or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a human by physical force are not generally considered to be harmful.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who are going to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging traffic conditions of the entire Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often crossing through isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose your grip: steep slopes, narrow lanes and dangerous curves are prevalent.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is all the more important that they are strictly adhered to.
However, quite bizarrely, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the trail, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit confectionery is common, with apples being used throughout the year and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be dry or liquid depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catchall term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
Used without any other qualifiers, however, the term tends to indicate the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of dishes spiced with simplicity, the predominant tastes favored by Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored condiments.
The ladders support the rider's legs, hanging on either side of the rails.
They provide the rider with better stability, but they can pose safety issues because a rider's feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the saddle but remains with one foot on the ladder, the horse can drag it along with him when he is chasing it.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stair belts to detach from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a rider falling from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought-after place for mountaineering in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and high granite peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes through walls of unlimited potential.
Snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, consisting of sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums in English, who organize their entire holidays around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old. We have cave paintings of skiers from before 5000 B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norse opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Backpack skiing: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, ski touring or backpack skiing.
It is a related activity, but usually not involving alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed on much steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar trail to the hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking  but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack behind you on well-groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Typically, crossing several countries would mean going through visa and passport control procedures over and over again.
In this sense, the Schengen area is organised in a way as one country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport controls.
Similarly, a Schengen visa holder does not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen countries, thus saving time, money and documents.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique, and some tax authorities consider antiques to be more than 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer farming is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other trades.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in the large-scale reindeer farming, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as beasts of burden.
Nowadays, many Sámi people have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word Gypsy is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and a misperception of the Roma population.
If the country you are going to visit is subject to a travel advisory, it may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is meant for their citizens.
One example would be how U.S. citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified way, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Extreme weather' is a generic term used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and comes in many forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the severe weather risks in the area as it could upset their travel plans.
It is advisable for anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone to have some professional training.
A search on the Internet for "hostile environment" course will probably provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-play, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are plentiful, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which the sex (X) is not declared or documents updated to correspond to the desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as much.
Search warrants at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through the scanning process without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Backflow is the flow back to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a fast current can form towards the deep waters.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion in an attempt to swim backwards, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to head for a position where you're not trapped again, and depending on what skills you have and whether or not anyone has seen you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock manifests itself more quickly than culture shock (it lasts less than honeymoon euphoria), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes encounter particular difficulties in readjusting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost the customs of your native culture.
When you first moved to a new country, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that visiting a new country requires a process of adjustment.
The world doesn't always expect that patience and understanding are also required for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting things for kids in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The noise of tourists and vendors is usually constant, and the sound and light show is like something out of a storybook.
The sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula that is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains join to give birth to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, called the Sentinel Range, lies the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 15,750 feet (4,892 m).
In remote places with no phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is commonly used in maritime transport, including by recreational vessels, as well as by shipments requiring remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a year-long break is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending a university, without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, taking a year of study abroad can actually increase your chances of gaining access to higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great place for canoeing. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller craft or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is 1 in forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you go on land only for excursions on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and the city visit is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike the personal fears and antipathies towards other things that manifest in so many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft operates and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies had their own planes, but other routes and the smaller companies had a problem.
If they've airlifted something, some routes can take days to unload and damage.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as hold baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and here you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do it for you).
But it's not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare in business class, and up to eleven times more in first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which case they charge fares according to the requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from interethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern commercial center, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with the glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres, are lined with traditional 18th-century red-brick roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views over the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
In the north, easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has become beyond the borders of the country following an enthusiastic tour of its splendor by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus makes regular trips to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work until death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Don't vandalize the place by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most panels are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
The regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, unpolitical and arrogant.
Although it is often just a stereotype that does not correspond to reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred) will help you to cope with much more ease.
The reserved attitude of the Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a little courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It is home to a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring yours, especially one in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from the ones available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any seasonings available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always start with a capital letter, even within the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or an adjective being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most being pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters you have to pay more attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies with the vowel after them.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Obviously, a person who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may draw the premature conclusion that Portuguese is sufficiently close to be unnecessary to study.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated today and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas with favorable weather conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.
Plants look no better than in their natural environment, so don't be tempted to pick even just one of them.
If you visit a formal landscaped garden, collecting 'specimens' will also lead to your expulsion, no question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, where you can easily orient yourself and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
 But being in the upper tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it's clear, rarely).
There are also a few buses that travel north to Hebron, where tradition has it that the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried along with their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by both nonbelievers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake, out in the open, watching the sunrise.
There are of course explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening in Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the distance from the mainland, the mammals were unable to make the journey, the result being that the giant tortoise is the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you'll experience polar night, which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon line.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark at that hour.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not so often a problem, you'll be able to enjoy the stars, too.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Costumes are the standard dress in business, and coworkers address one another by their family name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is a key element, with emphasis on teamwork rather than individual achievement.
