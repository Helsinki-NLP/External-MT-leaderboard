Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid to find themselves on The Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly have signed up to a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm came after the Assembly was renamed the Welsh Parliament.
Now, members of Congress from different political backgrounds are all concerned that the new title might make them a laughing stock.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that their new name would rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
Not for our Welsh readers: twp is the singular in Welsh and pwp is poop.
A representative of the Plaid party said that the whole faction is "dissatisfied" and therefore they are proposing alternatives.
One Conservative MP said his party was open to the name change, but noted that the MWP is only one step away from the name Muppet.
It is worth noting here that in Welsh the letter w is pronounced similarly to u in Yorkshire English, i.e. MWP pronounced map.
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drafting the bill introducing the name change is as follows: The final decision on the titles for the nomination of members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the deputies.
The 2017 Act governing the Government of Wales allowed the National Assembly for Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the name Welsh Parliament and which was widely supported.
As regards the title of Members of Parliament, the Commission prefers the title Welsh Parliament Member and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation has favoured the alternative of MWP.
Members of parliament are coming up with more and more alternatives, but the agreement is quite difficult, which is causing problems for the Speaker of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who must submit a bill on the name changes in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect other aspects of the functioning of the National Assembly, including the disqualification of members and the structure of committees.
The final vote on the question of their own title will be taken by the Members during the debate on the Bill.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing its name
Citizens are voting on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is intended to end a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, one of whose provinces is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour's name is essentially a territorial claim and has repeatedly challenged its request for EU and NATO membership.
President Gyorge Ivanov of Macedonia himself opposes the referendum on the name change and is therefore not participating in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise that they must make for EU and NATO membership.
Harlem churches are in trouble, St. Martin's bells are ringing
"In the old days, I heard from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams says.
Today, none of them are.
As you say, the bar's disappearance would be understandable.
People are having a different kind of social life these days, he says.
Bar is no longer the community lounge where people go every day.
As for the churches, Adams is afraid that the sale of church property will not replace the leaders' hopes, and that they will eventually return to the same place where they started.
The churches will be replaced by residential buildings whose population will not help the fate of the remaining churches.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white  claims , which will further hasten the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments will join the community.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem grew into a black city. The Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the '30s,
It was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who is known for his boycott of the shops on 125th Street in Harlem that refused to employ blacks or sell black goods.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell tower was built at the request of the community led by the Reverend Johnson.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson of St. Martin's Parish, proudly referred to the bells as the "Bells of the Poor".
In July, the expert who spoke on the bell said that the bell is "a cultural heritage", "an instrument of irreplaceable historical significance".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had joined the larger bell at the Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't hire anyone to replace him.
In St. Martin's, a complicated situation has developed in recent months involving architects and contractors, partly involved by the church's secular leadership and partly by the bishop's office.
The parish's governing body, the parish council, wrote to the bishop's office in July, arguing that the office would 'provide the costs' for the council, even though the council had not participated in the selection of architects and contractors contracted by the office.
Some members of the community complain about the lack of transparency around the office building.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked by a shark while fishing for shrimp
Official reports say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while fishing for crab on the opening day of crab fishing season Saturday in California.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. on the beach at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy crying for help, and he called out to him with a plume to help him get out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that the boy was just excited because he had caught a cancer, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "It bit me!"
He bit me!
"His shoulder was torn at the collarbone, "and Hammel described what he saw when he reached the boy.
I started to shout for everyone to get out of the water, "There's a hook in the water".
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
As rescue captain Larry Giles told the press, a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined at the time to be a non-human species.
Captain Giles also said the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities have closed the beach between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons.
Giles says that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would expand into the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's would be competing with expert vendors and department store-style pepper shakers from the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its push into the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which is still growing amid falling sales of fashion and household goods, the chain is testing larger piper stands at 11 stores nationwide, and if successful, will be opening in more stores from next year.
The increase in the pipeline is due to the fact that stores are trying to fill the shelf space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items in various ways.
Sainsbury's said it would double its product offering to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw, which it is offering for the first time.
But the former brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be located in larger areas, with brand-specific stalls like Boots and similar stores waiting for customers.
The store chain is also re-launching the Boutique make-up line, where most of the products are now vegan  as more and more young shoppers are looking for them.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its presence in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the other is opening this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the proliferation of online shopping and the shift of food shopping habits to small local shops, big-box stores will have to do more to lure shoppers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the offerings will increasingly resemble mixed-use stores as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and non-food products.
Since acquiring the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened Argos and some Habitat units in hundreds of stores. This has also had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The chain's previous attempt to wrinkle beauty and pharmaceutical stores failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but a dispute over the distribution of revenues in its pharmaceutical divisions ended it.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the operator of the Lloyds chain, for £125m three years ago.
The chain said Lloyds would be involved in the strategy and would offer a wider range of luxury skincare products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "By changing the look of our pepper shakers, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
We also have trained staff who provide counsel to those who are interested.
Our brand offers meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location provide a seductive force that takes the shopping experience to a new level.
Peter Jones is "thumped" after Holly Willoughby backs out of an £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left the show after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal to focus on her new dealings with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, the brand of home-wear and accessories.
The two celebrities' businesses have been compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby had pulled the plug on Dragons Den star Peter Jones when he pulled out of their promising lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his own highly lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "flabbergasted" when the television personality announced during a tense meeting at the headquarters of Jones's business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that his new contracts totalling £1.5 million were not enough time to devote to their joint home wear and accessories brand, Truly.
The two celebrities' venture has been compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11m.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones had left the island nation for one of his vacations.
According to a source, "Truly" was by far the most important thing to Holly.
He was going to be doing this for the long haul, and it's going to be his livelihood for the next few decades.
His exit was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because the start was so close.
The warehouse at the Marlow office is full of merchandise for sale.
Experts say the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the business millions, thanks to the huge investment in a range of items from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear, and the potential for slippage.
And it could mean the end of an old friendship.
The host, with three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
He started Truly with Willoughby Capp back in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The two couples often vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will be the M&S head of product and take over from Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented on the incident last night: "We do not wish to comment on [Jones'] business affairs".
Hard words were spoken, then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider unpresidential, and for his positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give so much away?
"Trump asked in a funny newsreader's voice.
I didn't let it go.
He noted that Kim would like to meet for a second time after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, the talks on nuclear disarmament have been stalled.
More than three months after the June Singapore summit, North Korean Representative Ri Jongho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country sees no "adequate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
In addition, the US maintains pressure sanctions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his campaign speech.
"Things are going great with North Korea", he said.
We were supposed to go to war with them.
Millions of people would have died.
But now we're really good together.
As you said, your efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results in the prospect of ending missile tests, releasing hostages and returning American troops home.
He also explained why he was talking about his relationship with Kim in such an unusual way.
"It's not hard to be a president, but there's not a crowd of 10,000 out there trying to get in, there's only about 200 standing in front of me", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
In Indonesia, hundreds of people have died in the tsunami and earthquake that devastated the island
Indonesia refused international aid after the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be evacuated, no national disaster was reported, which would be a prerequisite for international aid to arrive.
"In the past, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not need international help, so we are in a bit of a difficult situation", Sumbung said.
Save the Children is already working on a relief team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in the rescue efforts on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to see if international aid organizations need to be involved.
Despite the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating force of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, this is not common in other coastal areas.
While a tsunami warning was in place, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning system in Paluu also contributed to the disaster that claimed lives.
Even in the best of weather, travel between the Indonesian islands can be difficult.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship based in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but it's still at least three days before it reaches the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and has not spared on road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year's elections.
The president also has to deal with persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as a result of the riots, in which Christian and Muslim gangs fought each other in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has scored a huge equaliser against Chelsea
In the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute to save Liverpool from losing to Chelsea.
His team was 0-1 down when Sturridge was sent off by Xherdan Shaqiri about 100 yards from Chelsea's gate.
First he threw the ball to the left, then he kicked a big kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot passed high above the sixteenth and the net flew towards the upper right corner.
The ball finally got into the net over the protruding Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"I just wanted to get in position because there's always someone like Shaq who's going to put the ball forward, so I tried to get in position as best I could", Sturridge said in response to a question from LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I just took it off, and then I didn't think much, and I shot him.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a 25th-minute goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
He passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the corner of the blue, then managed to break out of the middle of the field and rush into Liverpool's court.
Kovacic started after a quick inning and got the ball back in midfield.
Then he kicked Hazard into the 16th with a beautiful pass.
Hazard ran the defense and finally sent the ball into the far corner of the Liverpool goal with a left-handed shot to Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea are playing Videoton at 3pm on Thursday in London in the UEFA Europa League.
The Indonesian tsunami has already killed 832 people
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the local disaster management agency reported on Sunday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and the resulting 6-meter-high waterfall wave have also buried several people under the rubble, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, are covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of the woman stabbed to death.
Police have launched a murder investigation after the body of a woman was discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents in the area to report anyone who has seen anything or is dead.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said the investigation is still in its early stages, however, I would like to ask anyone who has been in the John Street area of Birkenhead and may have seen or heard anything to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on board with a camera, to contact us as well, because they may have information that is relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
Later that afternoon, the woman's friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body had come from in the early hours of the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police are notifying the victim's family.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building at this time.
When he found out what had happened, the man was speechless.
Residents of the building have been advised that it may be several hours before they can re-enter the building.
One of the officers told someone that the whole building is being treated as a crime scene.
One woman was struggling with tears.
"This is terrible", he repeated.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another outside.
Several police officers inside the cordon were watching the block.
Anyone with any information please send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on the anonymous number 0800 555 111, and refer to the file 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Parliamentary Cromwell is the latest victim of the history-rewrite craze.
The banishment of the statue may be a poetic justice for Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers who, in their Taliban zeal, destroyed England's cultural and ecclesiastical heritage.
But the Cromwell Society says Crick's proposal is "crazy", an "attempt to rewrite history".
According to the president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith: "It was inevitable that at some point in the current debate over the removal of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would eventually be targeted.
During the English Civil War, the destruction of the statues was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's striking portrayal of Cromwell reflects 19th-century views and is a memorial to a historical figure who is still celebrated by many today.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell may be less powerful today than he was at the end of the 19th century, but many still see parliament as a protector against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, monarchy.
Whether this picture is accurate remains a matter of historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this conflict, which broke out in the mid-17th century, had a bearing on the future of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents one side of this conflict.
And his achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance.
A Chinese farmer was stabbed to death by a killer pig
Local media reports that a pig attacked and stabbed a farmer to death in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by his surname, Yuan, was found with a blood-stained, torn baton near a pig market in Liupanshui, Kujchu Province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
The man and his cousin traveled from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man's body and discovered that the door to the neighbor's pig was open.
He said the giant candy pig in the pig's mouth was bloody.
According to the report, the expert examination revealed that the 250-pound pig had indeed killed its owner.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and torn to shreds", said a relative referred to only by his surname, Wuk, by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to the security cameras, Yuan stepped into the pigs' cage at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it wouldn't harm others while police were on the scene investigating the tracks.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a couple was attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, causing life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales had squeezed a farmer's tractor until his wife had failed to alert him.
After a farmer in Oregon killed his own pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that although pigs are generally not aggressive, the taste of blood can make them aggressive.
They're very playful.
Like little children, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them respect, he said.
Heavy rainfall following Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it makes landfall over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will continue to cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa, with winds of 140 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, struck at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is forming over the Pacific Ocean and heading west toward the U.S. west coast, and as Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, it will flood the southwestern United States with heavy tropical moisture as a tropical storm.
The storm could bring up to 25 centimeters of rainfall to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the approaching tropical steam, which will meet low-pressure masses, will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Here, a rainfall of 310 cm can cause flash floods, debris-filled floods, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical steam can bring in places up to 5 inches of rain per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, some areas are expected to receive 5 to 10 centimeters of rain, especially in Arizona.
Sudden floods can also occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
During the tropical rains, it is especially not recommended to go hiking in the desert.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and storms can be accompanied by sudden gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching low-pressure masses could cause heavy rainfall in some locations off the coast of Southern California.
Up to 1.5 cm of rainfall is possible, which can cause minor flooding with debris and flat road conditions.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Tropical thunderstorms could hit Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and rainfall could spread to broader areas on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, the United States will experience intense temperature fluctuations as the polar air masses cool, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences over short distances in some places.
A prime example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 10 degrees.
In the coming days, the summer heat is expected to be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern parts of the United States, the weather is expected to be warm in the first half of October, with temperatures reaching about 10°C (82°F) from the southern Great Plains to parts of the northwest.
The temperature in New York City will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast suggests that temperatures in the eastern United States will likely be above average through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
Over 20 million viewers on six television channels followed the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of rape in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse was not resolved, and broadcasters were forced to cut their regular schedules due to a last-minute Friday twist: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake managed to communicate that the FBI had been given a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been kidnapped and tried to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate testimony that he was 100% sure that this never happened.
The testimony was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other channels which broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Also, Nielsen has a hard time measuring the number of people who watch the shows at work.
For comparison, that's the number of people who watch football games or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, of all the channels, Fox News Channel, which had the highest viewership of experts supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, averaged 5.69 million viewers over the entire day of the interview.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was watched by 3.1, NBC by 2.94, MSNBC by 2.89, and CNN by 2.52 million, according to Nielsen reports.
Interest didn't diminish after the audition.
The lead character in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement that he would vote for Senator Kavanaugh, he was seen on CNN and CBS Friday morning as a loud crowd of protesters greeted him as he climbed into the elevator to meet the Judiciary Committee.
He stood there staring at the crowd for minutes while the crowd mocked him, and CNN broadcast the scene live.
"I'm standing here in front of you", a woman told the senator.
Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in front of the nation's public?
Others shouted at her, "You can do what so many women can't".
Flake said his office issued a statement, and then before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share his story at the committee hearing.
He was seen on cable and broadcast channels hours later as the committee votes on whether to put Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
Flake, however, said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority have been urging.
Flake was convinced of the need for this after a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talks with Coons and later other senators.
Flake's decision was a good use of his power, since it was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of political game-play
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those opposed to her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics that jeopardized the future of the United Kingdom and undermined the nation's interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which appeared on the front page of the newspaper directly next to May's interview, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacks May's so-called Chequers plan on Brexit, saying that the idea of Britain and the EU managing each other's customs is "totally absurd".
The Wayde Sims murder: Police have arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of the murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Baton Rouge Police Department announced.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson's fight, and also reported that Sims' glasses fell off during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA was found on the WAFB channel, which is part of the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, police announced that the young man had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the Advocate report, the court has set bail at $350,000.
According to a preliminary report released Friday by the East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office, the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The bureau thanks the Louisiana State Police's Special Branch for Fugitive Criminals, the state police's Criminology Lab, the University Police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the relevant law enforcement agencies for their dedicated and persistent work in finding the truth.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that news of Sims' death had "shocked and shocked" the team.
"You always have to be afraid of something like this", Wade said.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
After the crater intensified with volcanic activity and a total of 183 gas and ash eruptions in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center urged the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several rumblings and tremors.
In pictures posted on social media in some areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, car windshields are covered in a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southeast of Mexico City after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of the Catalonia-separation referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powdered paint at the police who were holding them back, so that the streets that were once crowded with tourists were now covered in dense dust.
Later in the day, further fighting broke out, with police using rubber bullets to try to maintain order.
The "We will not forget, we will not forgive" slogans of pro-independence groups and the "Long live Spain" slogans of the pro-unity protesters stood in opposition for hours.
Local media reports said 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions continue to mount in the region, which is steeped in independence aspirations, following the referendum of October 1, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists celebrated.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for secession, although turnout was rather low as most unionists boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities say that almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop voting at polling stations with aggressive clashes.
Pro-independence groups were out on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration was unable to be stopped, it did not proceed in the proper way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, says there is no longer any chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents cheering for us to vote, but now our case is dead.
Although they won a substantial, if narrow victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties are struggling to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting a court ruling for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a demonstration in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense", he says.
One of the Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he would run in the European elections next year.
"This is the best way to reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents by running for the European elections", he said.
Londonderry: Police arrest three men who drove their car into a house
Police arrested a 33-year-old, a 34-year-old and a 39-year-old man who were driving into a house in Londonderry on multiple occasions.
The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. UK time at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
It could be that at some point, the car was even shot with a number line.
Menga's goal to beat Livingston to the Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Menga scored the first goal to secure Livingston's victory
Livingston, a newly promoted first-team player, surprised Rangers by adding to his second defeat Steven Gerrard, who has been coaching the club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference as Gary Holt's team went into a dead-end match with Hibernian in second place.
The Gerrards remain unbeaten in the Scottish League this season and next Sunday they face top-ranked Hearts, who are eight points behind.
But before that, the Rangers have a game Thursday in the Europa League against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased their division-leading winless streak to six, which means that Kenny Miller's replacement last month, Holt, has yet to be signed by the team.
Livingston missed several positions against the inaccurate guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead well before the game's only goal, as their offensive play caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through the defence but over-stretched the attack, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped to catch Craig Halkett's crossed ball in front of the goal line.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were confident that they could disturb the guests in the fixed playing situations.
The decisive goal was born from exactly such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in the defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it to make a run out of the 16th.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers were leading in possession, but the home defense remained impregnable, and Liam Kelly's goal was barely in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for one situation when Kelly had to defend against Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was kicked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, while Lithgow missed the gate on another Livingston free kick.
Two penalties were not awarded to the attacking team: one for Halkett's penalty against substitute Glenn Middleton and the other for handling.
"Fanominal game from Livingston"
This is Alasdair Lamont reporting from Tony Macaroni Arena for BBC Scotland.
Livingston was a phenomenal performer, and it was a huge hit.
The players performed brilliantly, and exceeded expectations.
The team's members and playing style have changed little since their return to the forefront, but Holt's efforts are also worthy of serious recognition, as the coach has been a huge boost to the team since his arrival.
Several players have been at their best.
Halkett, the team captain, was a mighty man with a well-organized defense, and Menga, a man who had a good shot at Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played without a plan.
As good as they've been at times under Gerrard, they've been unable to bring that level of performance.
The last shot was always missing from the formula. They only managed to break the home defense once, so the Rangers have to get back together quickly as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdogan met with mixed reception in Cologne
The morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday (September 29) was marked by a pleasant atmosphere and goodwill.
It was the last day of Erdoğan's divisive visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated over issues related to human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdoğan then traveled to Cologne for the inauguration of a newly built, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
Police have banned the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, citing security concerns, but many of the president's supporters have appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed dissatisfaction with Erdoğan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations are a good example of the divisive nature of the president's policies, who is celebrated as a hero by some Turkish-German citizens while others see him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist collided with a car and died
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford road in the southeast part of the city, at approximately 10:15 local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and emergency responders tried to help the cyclist, who died at the scene.
The collision came just months after another cyclist was fatally hit by a car accident on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
A statement from the London Police said police were still working to identify the man so they could notify the next of kin.
The investigation has led to road closures and bus disturbances, and authorities are advising motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a high-security man's death in a prison riot, the prison administration said.
The riots began at 0930 hours on Sunday morning at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire and have so far failed to be contained.
The authorities have sent a special unit called "Tornado" to the scene to deal with the situation, which involves eight prisoners who were confined to a wing of a building.
The members of the special unit suffered only minor head injuries, which were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the Penal Services Agency said a specially trained team of prison guards is handling the situation at Long Lartin.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injuries.
We will hand over those responsible to the police and they can expect to serve further prison sentences.
The Long Lartin Men's Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison warden reportedly had to be hospitalized after being assaulted by one of the inmates.
Last October, too, special forces were needed to quell a major riot in which prisoners attacked prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to cause sudden flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (but drought-stricken areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but that's exactly what the state is expected to expect early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the desert southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday night with heavy rain.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service posted the following message on Twitter: Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached tropical storms or depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina in 1967, for example, brought the A.Z. limit to 40 miles.
The National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 50×100 mm of precipitation, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the south-western desert areas (central areas of the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) rainfall of 25 to 50 mm is expected, but in some places it may be as high as 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa could bring relief to areas not threatened by flash floods, as the region is currently suffering from severe drought.
Although flooding is a serious threat, some of the rainfall can have a beneficial effect on the landscape of the Southwest that is struggling with drought.
The U.S. Drought Monitoring Service estimates that more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing minimum extreme drought, the second-highest category of drought, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first make landfall on the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
It remains hurricane-force, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 85 miles per hour [137 km/ h], it will move about 300 miles [600 km] south of the Mexican mainland of Punta Eugenia and head north at about 12 miles per hour [19 km/ h].
The storm will meet colder currents in the Pacific and lose its strength.
So it's expected to hit the coast of Mexico as a tropical storm again on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
Heavy rainfall is expected in some areas of Mexico, significantly increasing the chance of flooding.
 Rainfall averages 70 to 150 mm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with some areas expected to receive up to 250 mm of rainfall  according to weather.com.
Rosa then moves northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday, by which time it will have taken the form of a tropical depression, sweeping through Arizona and reaching southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat posed by Rosa and its remnants will be extreme rainfall in the southern California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern desert regions of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and tidal flows in desert areas, and landslides in mountainous areas are to be avoided.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 0400 local time, a wounded teenage boy was found in the Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace neighborhood.
The boy was rushed to the hospital, his condition is stable.
Police say a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
Authorities are asking the public to contact anyone with cell phone footage of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh has had to endure the outrage and anger of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party during his run.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that the man had sexually assaulted her decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford testified and stood by his earlier statements.
The president said Saturday that the American people had seen with their own eyes the brilliance and fearlessness of Kavanaugh that day.
"The votes for Judge Kavanaugh are votes for one of the most distinguished legal professionals of our time, with an impeccable record of public service", Trump told his West Virginia supporters.
The president was referring to Kavanaugh's candidacy in a wry way, while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running, basically, he said.
That's why I go everywhere to support the best candidates.
Trump has argued that the Democrats are pursuing a tactic of "resistance and obstruction".
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds killed in landslide in Indonesia, death toll rising
At least 384 people died as the huge waves hit the coast, triggered by a powerful earthquake and a landslide on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, local authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves nearly six meters (18 feet) high reached the shore at dusk, sweeping many away and destroying everything in their path.
The waterfall was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, not fled immediately, and so became victims of the waves", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come by itself, it swept cars, logs, houses and everything else off the shore", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling at 500 miles per hour in the open sea before it hit the shore.
Some climbed trees to escape the rain and escaped, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palun.
Aerial footage of the disaster released by the agency shows several destroyed buildings and businesses, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks shook the coastal city.
The earthquakes were felt in an area that is home to some 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT), the earthquake on Friday released about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and the resulting geographical features could have reinforced the effects of the spring tide.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant", with thousands of homes destroyed and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Several bodies were found in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured was 540 so far and that 29 more people were being sought.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and damage in the coastal area 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, known as Donggala, could be even higher as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications are completely paralyzed, no information can be obtained from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300 000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its specialists and volunteers are already on their way to the disaster area.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.
The agency received numerous criticisms on Saturday for failing to inform the public about the flooding in Palut, but officials said the waves had already reached the shore when the alert was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building trying to warn people on the street of an impending waterfall with desperate cries.
Within minutes, a huge wall of water hits the shore, sweeping away cars and buildings.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and the volcanic eruption caused power outages, rendering communications in the Palu area impossible, making it harder for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has sent relief supplies by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but authorities say the evacuated population will still be in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was opened only to facilitate relief efforts, and will remain closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up by Palun throughout Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian flood is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's team arrived safely from Donggala to Palu City, where the employees found shelter under tent poles set up in the office yard, but encountered terrible signs of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
They said they saw a lot of ruined houses.
It's really bad.
While relief teams were preparing for disaster relief, some complained that foreign experts with extensive experience in this field could not travel to Palua.
Under Indonesian regulations, all aid, relief supplies and personnel coming from overseas are allowed into the country only if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"The incident continues to be treated as a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 Once the government acknowledges that this is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international aid, but so far no reports have been made.
On the second night after Friday's quake and avalanche, friends and family members of the missing continued to wait in hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous rescue would shed some light on the dark atmosphere of science about natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, workers managed to rescue a woman who had been trapped for two days by her mother's body under the rubble.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national skydiving team, has trained two of the missing skydivers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month, this time in Indonesia.
In addition to the missing, other students were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
"As a veteran paratrooper, I have been burdened by what has happened", she said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse began to spread among the skydivers, he spent hours desperately trying to reach the contestants on WhatsApp who were attending the beach festival Palun.
But instead of two blue pipes, the messages were accompanied by one gray pipe.
I think that means the messages could no longer be delivered.
$26,750 stolen from a cash machine at the Newport on the Levee mall
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping center, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the cash van was just emptying an ATM at the entertainment center and was preparing to fill it with more banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
A man approached a Brink's employee from behind while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared purses.
Witnesses also saw several suspected perpetrators flee the scene, but the police statement does not give the exact number of suspects.
Anyone who would like information regarding the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper's name changed to Y
Kanye West, the rapper is now Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for a while, and his eighth album, released in June, was also titled Ye.
He announced the name change ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
She will replace Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
The new name is not only an abbreviation of the rapper's current stage name, but also has religious significance for West, according to his previous revelations.
I know that "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, "Te" means "I" West mentioned earlier when he was talking about the title of his album with Big Boy radio host.
So I am you and I am us and we are all one.
Kanye means the one, and that's just Ye, which is the good that's in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more about who we really are.
Ye is one of those famous rappers who is willing to change their name.
Sean Combs, for example, has previously run under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he would now prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, JAY-Z, also varied on whether to write his name in one, with a hyphen, or in capital letters.
The Mexican president has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
On the 50th anniversary of the bloody student protests, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing some 300 people, as leftist student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help Mexican youth  by providing monthly stipends to students and plans to establish additional free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The US should double its funding for AI solutions
As China becomes more active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and developer who has previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. doesn't have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country aims to become the world's number one AI developer by 2030.
"Doubling the cost of AI research would be a good start, as every other country is significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in AI is on the horizon", Lee said.
Doubling research funding could also double the chance that the United States will take the next big step in artificial intelligence, he told CNBC in an interview.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month under the auspices of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the best American Othello player, and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese division.
Lee acknowledged the results of previously announced technology competitions by the US government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next such event would be held, as it would be an opportunity to find new future-makers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain the government funding they need for their research, Lee said.
It's not China that's killing the scientific leaders, it's the big corporations that have done it.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired some big-time academic minds over the years to work in the field of AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. in its efforts to develop artificial intelligence.
I think that automatically green cards should be given to people who have a PhD in the field of artificial intelligence.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China provides support to academic staff in a similar way to the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations that provide funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the US Department of Defense created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where various industry experts and academics can work together, and the White House announced the creation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
And the NSF is currently spending $100 million a year to fund AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislature, which had planned to create a national security intelligence committee, had not taken further steps in the matter for months.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, ending decades of disagreement with Greece that had prevented the country's application for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has argued that its northern neighbour's name indicates a claim to the Greek territory of the same name, and has thus far vetoed the country's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the state's new name, but opponents of the national sentiment say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's mostly Slavic population.
President Ivanov has declared that he will not participate in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has made it doubtful whether the 50% turnout required for a valid referendum will be reached.
The question on the ballot papers is: Do you support the country's membership of NATO and the EU and accept the agreement with Greece?
The supporters of the name change, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the ruins of Yugoslavia, to have a chance at EU and NATO membership.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that would mean a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding in itself, a sufficient number of MEPs have stated that they feel bound by the result of the vote.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
According to the state election commission, no reports of irregularities were received until 1 p.m. on the day of the vote.
However, the turnout has so far only reached 16%, compared to 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ended with 66% of registered voters).
"I came to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski (62), who cast his vote in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted in favour of the name change in Strumica in a referendum on 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for the boycotters of the referendum.
"We also support the country's membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a proud, uplifted head, and not through the waitress' door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership could provide investments in Macedonia, which the country with a 20% unemployment rate desperately needs.
"I think the majority will support our cause, because more than 80% of the country's population basically supports EU and NATO membership", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He also added that the vote for the "yes" means securing the future of the country.
A poll released by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research last week showed that 30.43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, by Macedonian TV's Telma, predicts a 57% turnout on Sunday.
Of those who want to go to the polls, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be greater than 50% by at least one vote.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero scores by swapping the Brighton full defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have played hard to get with Brighton's defence, and Manchester City have won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero scored his 65th-minute goal as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine team, in the first step of the attack, was given a pass in the middle of the field, and
He slipped through the three Brighton defenders and made his way into the open.
Then four green meadows surrounded Aguero.
He switched a defender and then ran more when he got near Brighton's 16.
Then he passed to the left of Sterling, who was showing up.
The English team had already returned the ball in the 16th, forcing it back to Aguirre, who finished the action with his right foot, hitting the right side of Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
Aguero has a leg problem, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has told reporters.
We agreed that 55 is the maximum.
And that's exactly what happened.
Luckily, that's when he scored.
Sterling's action has taken the lead in the championship match against the Blues.
The goal came in the 29th minute, when
Aguero, who is on the Brighton side, has a great pass.
He's got a beautiful crossball going for Leroy Sane on the left wing.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he started Sterling for the long.
The battle of the blues was just about to get the ball into the gate before it slipped out of the baseline.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, starting at 12:55 next Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to make it harder for the Rockies.
With the Nationals missing out on a playoff spot, there was no reason to really push.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, is eager to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance to play.
The Rockies have secured at least a consolation spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still up for grabs.
Even though we're out of options, we can still stand them in Denver with the mood of the crowd and the other team expected to be at its peak this year.
Of course I'm in the mood to go out like this.
The Nationals have yet to pick a starter for Sunday, but news reports are that Scherzer will be pitching in this situation.
For Scherzer, who took part in the practice on Thursday, it will be his 34th opening pitch on Sunday, which is usually his day off.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7 this season, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 and 2/3 innings.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia
The president also made a point of referring to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
November is the end of everything we've accomplished.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, the big ones. I personally don't run, but I'm running, so I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates.
Trump continued: "Everyone can see what these terrible, radical Democratic groups are doing, they can see it with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and whatever means they are willing to use to regain power, the malice and the baselessness are visible.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample, so that they can have control, they can have power, that's what they want, control and power, but we don't give up.
The president says the Democrats are going to use "resistance and obstruction".
"They've been watching this for the last four days", he said, "calling the Democrats angry and malicious and mean and liars".
He mentioned by name Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to whom the assembled crowd had expressed vocal displeasure.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what is it?
No, uh, no, wait. All that bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer supportive of diversity.
He does not tolerate those who freely express their opinions
I was not at all surprised when the Momentum activists in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I'm just the last in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told they're not welcome simply because we've said what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly for her unrelenting stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors didn't like it that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
And the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which, ironically, are the very issues that Jeremy also disagreed with the previous leaders on.
The invitation to the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday stated that they wanted an inclusive and productive meeting.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, these Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
Today, however, the tone has unfortunately changed and the promise of a "more restrained, more polite" policy has been forgotten, if it ever comes to fruition.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate dissent and judges every opinion on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This trend started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we shared a political stance, have been increasingly expecting me to turn my back on my individual opinions and take a stand on things I would never agree with otherwise, whether it's national security or the single European market.
After every public speech I have made, regardless of what I actually said, people start to slander me on social media, demanding my removal, criticizing the centrist policies and telling me that I shouldn't even be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues because the comments I get are usually about politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to face sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, yet they do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of modern politics is that attacks of this magnitude have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn last week spoke about the need for Labour to promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we have given up on diversity and with every "no confidence" motion and every change in the electoral rules, the party's support is narrowing.
Over the years, I've been told by many to keep my mouth shut, to be less verbal, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student, because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had so neglected schools that our classrooms were almost collapsed, and then I fought for better public services for those most in need as both a local councillor and a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, and I didn't do that in the last election.
It was quite clear to everyone in Nottingham East what political positions I represented and what issues I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will not only hurt families but also companies and public services, I do not understand why I have to spend so much time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my most important message is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political motivation will deter me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of all.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
AyrMelrose 3817: Ayr is unbeaten to the top
Two late attempts have slightly altered the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr have won the most entertaining match of the day, the Tennent's Premiership.
The team currently sits at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
With their unparalleled defense and their superior exploitation of the situation, they have won, so the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
"We have had to face many challenges in our matches so far, but we are still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, the Melrose player, said: "We have to admit that Ayr have taken advantage of their situation much better than we have.
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, from which Frazier Climo scored, gave Ayr the advantage, and the yellow card from Rory Hughes, the Scottish captain on loan from the Warriors, would have allowed Melrose to overcome the gap, but Jason Baggot's attempt failed to score.
Climo sweated Ayr's defense with a penalty in the second half, then scored a single-season try to end the first half 17-5 for Ayr.
The Melrose started the second half strong, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagg reduced the team's lead to five points.
The game was then halted for a long time as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be taken off the pitch, and in the sequel Ayr further increased their lead with a try by Stafford McDowall, whose rewards were reaped with the help of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, was also given a yellow card, and then the Melrose managed to manfully stop Bruce Colvine's experiment, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to close again, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for putting down Clima without a ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line behind Ayr's attacking team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took down David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry's draw forward to the home side's fifth attempt.
The star of Still Game is starting a new career in the hospitality industry.
It seems that one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is moving into the hospitality industry, having just been made the head of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvist in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred in with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season will be their final, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has not commented on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun has suggested that Kiernan is trying to profit from Glasgow's booming hospitality industry.
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the sail-decorated naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags flying over the buildings.
From the naval bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the slogan is: "We have the right to the sea".
It's our duty to get it back.
In landlocked Bolivia, memories of the lost coastline, which Chile lost in a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources, and the desire to once again wave the Pacific Ocean are alive and well.
These hopes have perhaps gained strength in decades, with Bolivia awaiting the International Court of Justice's final ruling on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the ball, which floods people with a spirit of togetherness and peace, who are waiting for the outcome in a positive mood", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the International Court of Justice's decision, hoping that the Hague tribunal will side with Bolivia and that Chile, after decades of rapsodial behavior, will be forced to sit down to negotiate for Bolivia's independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic, indigenous president who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year, could lose a lot with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said in late August.
Some analysts, however, feel that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and that it would not change the situation much if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no jurisdiction over Chilean territories and has also agreed in advance that it will not influence the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling came less than six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, an expert on international law in Chile.
And the last four years have not only failed to help the cause of Bolivia, but have even reversed it.
The issue of the sea exit has been diverted by the current Bolivian government to its own ends  explained Zárate.
The remaining goodwill of Chileans has been lost because of Morales's hostile rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will certainly resume negotiations at some point, but after what happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the finding that the court decision would have been unusually swift.
Monday will be an "exceptional opportunity" for Bolivia to open a new chapter in its relations with Chile and a chance to resolve the 139-year-old dispute, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the naval dispute to gain political advantage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The verdict gives us a chance to see that it's time to move on from the past.
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho says his country will not be the first to dismantle its nuclear weapons if it cannot be trusted in Washington.
Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
He made the remarks as it appeared that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had managed to resume stalled nuclear talks more than three months after his summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri said he "wishes" to believe that continued sanctions and the US's obstruction of the declaration ending the Korean War will ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's commitment to dismantling the arsenal, which the country probably considers the only key to its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion show, the giant headgear will soon be available in high-end stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/summer 2019 collection, which was greeted with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience at Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats caused a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the fashion designers above have also launched their eye-catching designs.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a feathery, wide sleeve that almost completely engulfed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included a gem-decorated watermelon, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, which were not designed to keep a person's head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a range of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their mouths sewn together and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of these pieces resembled a diving mask complete with a pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melting-pot ice cream cone.
If you like these spectacular pieces, you're in luck.
Fashion analysts are predicting that the giant hats may be on their way to the top-end fashion stores.
The oversized hats follow the path of the "La Bomba", a 60cm-wide straw frame that we've seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the impractical hat that has taken over social media has unveiled another piece on the runway: a straw beach bag that is almost the size of the bathing suit model that holds it.
The dark orange raffia bags  decorated with raffia stitches and topped with a white leather handle  were one of the highlights of Jacquemus' 2019 Spring/Summer La Riviera collection at the Paris Fashion Show.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see huge hats and beach bags in upscale clothing stores next summer.The designer has made such an elementary impression on everyone that it would be hard to deny the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have traditionally delivered excellent education.The recent excellent test results have not changed this situation in 2018, which is only further reinforced by individual and group successes in sports, the arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 pupils are already studying in these institutions, which are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and which are committed to providing the best possible services to pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen career and their position as citizens of the world.
In an education sector where there is the possibility to design and implement customised school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove to be popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
But if you speak in his language, it will reach his heart.
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that students from independent schools across the country have the best results in foreign languages.
68% of all students studying a foreign language achieved a higher A grade (more than 85%).
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students achieved an A-level in Mandarin, while 72% of German, 69% of French and 63% of Spanish students achieved an A-level.
These results also support the view of independent schools in Scotland that foreign languages are essential skills which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as subjects of choice have become at least as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent and non-public schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Vocational Training Board found that 17% of employers said they had difficulties filling vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
This shows that language skills are becoming increasingly essential for young people to have successful careers.
As more and more jobs expect foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, learning a foreign language will give you a lifelong knowledge that is clearly beneficial.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to applicants who speak several languages.
According to a YouGov survey  of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013,  75 percent of respondents did not know any foreign language well enough to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15 percent).
That is why it is important to focus on language education for children now.
Speaking more languages, especially in developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children that will help them to be more likely to apply for more important jobs as adults.
In Scotland, every school will be taught different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of major importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever the child's area of interest, he or she will be able to learn a number of optional languages at independent schools and will be trained by teachers who are experts in their fields.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is not difficult to see that in today's global business environment, languages remain vital to a country's future and this should be reflected in education.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated more as a skill for international communication.
Independent schools offer a choice, diverse and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire  It has to be that way.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is in San Diego, making his debut with the Lakers on Sunday.
Now, fans who are sitting on their hands and knees to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers don't have to wait much longer.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll spend on the court is questionable.
"More than one and less than 48", Walton wrote on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play for a limited time.
A few days after practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to play in the preseason to be ready", he replied.
Trump's West Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump is starting a long line of campaign events in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This will be the first of five events Trump is planning next week, including stops in his supportive states of Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat has been postponed, Trump is trying to rally support for the next midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress when the November vote is in.
When does Trump's West Virginia event start tonight, and where can you follow him online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. eastern time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online via YouTube live.
Trump is likely to also touch on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which has proved particularly tense in light of sexual harassment allegations, and the Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary purpose of the sudden increase in the number of events is to help the Republican Party get ahead of the November elections.
Trump's campaign adviser says the five events next week will serve to activate voters and supporters as Republicans try to defend and increase their current majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
"Having control of Congress is so critical to the president's political agenda that he's going to visit as many states as possible, and we're looking at a very busy campaign period", a campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The event, scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, will draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and could even be covered by the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help his Republican nominee for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who polls show is not in a good position.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to intervene in person to get more publicity", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA is fighting with full shoulder to hold on to their Sunday individual to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts, the Ryder Cup was desperately needed for Saturday afternoon fours.
The swinging shirt of luck and momentum is a fairly new concept in sports, yet it's believed by all players, especially in events like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead and they're only four points down, so we're in the ball game", said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe is still leading by four points, and there are 12 more to come.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they've finally got a little backbone, and they can draw encouragement from a lot of things, including the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved himself from the opening shot to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
Baylor's victory cries grew louder as he advanced the lap, with a critical twitch and a tie in the fourth game, with him and Thomas two-two behind.
The decisive roar of the match resulted in a 15th-hole-like cheer, the kind that would convince the viewer that the American team was not yet lost.
"You just have to dig deep inside yourself and focus on your own game", Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes for a chance to make a mark.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair in the Ryder Cup, have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's weird but adorable pair has four out of four, and they can't seem to get it wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to finish above par on Saturday afternoon, and to perform similarly on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the final nine sessions of Friday morning.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics between them and the crowd that was noisy to support them, they became the benchmark for Sunday, and no one is more expected to secure Europe's victory at the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing would be to win at different holes at the same time.
But it's too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning show, when he was playing with Alex Noren.
Once with one and twice with two strokes above the par, the Spaniard and the Swede finished on the first nine holes, which pushed them into a valley of waves from which they had no chance of climbing.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help me out of your hole.
Four-ball games and foursomes are extremely entertaining to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, who gives advice and who doesn't, and how strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is starting with a significant advantage for the last day, but this fourth section showed that the American team has the courage to fight, although many of them, especially from the American side, were lacking.
Europe starts the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead.
Europe may start the final day of the Ryder Cup with a pleasant lead after Saturday's four-ball and four-stroke match ended with a 10-6 score against the United States.
The pair of dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way, scoring two victories over the weakened Tiger Woods, extending the gap to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team  who are trying to reclaim the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago  dominated the consistently flawed American team in the morning foursomes, winning the series 3-1.
America had a bigger resistance in the fourth quarter, coming back two games, but they couldn't even close the gap.
Jim Fury's team needs to score eight points in Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four in a row, while he and Molinari - who after a sensational weekend are referred to as simply "Molliwood" - are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After beating Woods-Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they put on a great team effort to beat the unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau's double by a decisive 5 and 4.
Woods, who has been in two games this long on Saturday, has sometimes shown his talent, but he's lost 19 of his 29 games, four of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning fours, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and in the fours, he defeated the pair of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were first and third in the world rankings, 2 & 1.
Europe, however, was not able to do all that on this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it with their two points on Saturday.
They won a painful 2-1 victory over the pair of Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit in individual events, although a draw for the defending Fury team is enough to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of being only second best, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea is poised to unilaterally dismantle if it doesn't trust its negotiating partner.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions only increased mistrust of the United States and that it was unlikely that the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the UN's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant and generous steps" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, closing down nuclear test sites and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and nuclear technology.
"Unfortunately, we have not seen any similar response from the Americans", he said.
 In the absence of trust in America, we feel that our nation's security is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances, it is impossible to disarm unilaterally and first.
While Ri reiterated his disappointment with North Korea over Washington's resistance to the idea of "partial" denuclearization, a scenario in which North Korea would receive rewards for its actions so far, his statement seemed significant because he did not explicitly reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, while Trump guaranteed the inviolability of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States is of the view that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has not relented on the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"America insists on starting with nuclear disarmament and increasing pressure with sanctions to force its will on us, and it is also protesting against anyone declaring war over", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the non-easing of sanctions only increases our suspicion.
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump was planned, but the US president mentioned it separately at the UN earlier this week.
The minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in had met three times in the past five months, and added: "If the country involved in the nuclear disarmament were South Korea, not the United States, then the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a stalemate".
Yet Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that a North American continent targeted by North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the evil president, called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the UN this year, Trump - who threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year - lavished praise on Kim for his courage to take steps toward denuclearization, but also noted that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea carried out its denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time limit, so whether it was two years, three years or five months, it didn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions so far.
In contrast, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must be enforced without fail until we achieve actual, final, verifiable nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rivell during a break in the UN General Assembly, and then said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go so well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like" demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States also took the necessary steps.
According to Mun, the "necessary steps" Kim mentioned would be security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps that could lead to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are trained to get enough rest.
A new Harvard study this year encouraged students to get more sleep, fighting the increasingly cat-centric culture of caffeinated all-night classes.
One scholar concluded that students at the world's top universities are often completely confused about how they should care for themselves.
The course, which he says is the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and practices as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He was inspired to develop the course by a lecture he had given earlier on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only facing this now, as a senior?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised her.
The course, which was first launched this year, will teach students how good sleep habits have a fundamental impact on their academic and athletic performance, as well as having a positive impact on their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health service, said that the university decided to start the course because during the week the students were found to be exceptionally sleep-deprived.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
One example is showing a picture of a college classroom where students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and why it matters in bedtime routines.
Another section explains to participants how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They show a map of the campus with interactive icons to encourage participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know we're not going to change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know this, just as they have a right to know the health effects of smoking", said Professor Czeisler.
A culture that considers overnight learning to be an achievement continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are resulting in insomnia becoming an increasing problem.
Getting enough and quality sleep is the students' secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against obesity, because sleep deprivation forces the brain into a starvation mode and causes a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So helped design the course for Professor Czeisler, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, who was a freshman at Harvard last year.
He said that hearing what he heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to take up the cause of starting a university-level training program.
He hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before they enter the competitive sphere.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a bedtime alarm, an alarm clock for waking up, and learn about the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electric screens and LEDs, which can easily distract them from the day's activities and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston  Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores
The Rangers suffered another foreign defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb-slip Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Iroquois were looking to secure their first away victory since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat to Gary Holt in 18 games as manager, eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership top seed Hearts.
Menga had a seven-minute lead, and the Rangers' unmotivated team was nowhere near a tie.
While the Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston held on to third, falling behind Hibernian by a mere goal difference.
The Rangers may also face further difficulties after coastguard Calum Spence was medically injured with a head injury caused by an object that was likely dropped from the passenger's lounge.
Gerrard also made an eight-point turnaround on the team that swept Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt is about to take the same 11 men from Livingston who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy to watch his team of the year choke his opponent wherever he could.
Although the Rangers led the way in ball possession, Livingston went above and beyond with what he had.
They could have scored in the first two minutes, when Menga kicked Scott Pittman into the goal with his first innings, but the midfielder failed to sell the ball.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick landed on team captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate, Alan Lithgow, hit just the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the 15th minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but former Ibero-Cities goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute was against the previous game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers missed another Jacobs-forced hit.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher put the ball in for Scott Robinson, who perfectly found Menga for the easy finish.
Gerrard decided to take a break, Coulibaly was replaced by Ryan Kentre, and it had an almost immediate impact on the game when the extreme Morelos kicked, but the impressive form Kelly was blocking in time.
Livingston continued to get to play the exact game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept up the long balls one after the other.
Holt's team could have taken a bigger lead in the last minute, but McGregor got the net and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow went off from a corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton tried to fight off another 11 when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thompson was unable to convince him this time.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
A passage from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been a staple of science ever since, and it became a part of pop culture in the 1950s with the movie Bells of Coronado, starring the bizarre cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is this miracle?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter, and it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can hear the sound of atoms being emitted by the radioactivity of minerals.
Listen, this is a lot of bullshit.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect and kill abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a lab.
So they can see the protein that's associated with many cancers, and they inject the treated immune cells back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells was able to shed her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
Part of the method is to harvest the immune cells from the patient; modify them in the laboratory to detect a protein called HER2, which is a common side effect of many cancers; and then transplant the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "increases the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancers", explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, based on targeting immune cells and "training" them to attack cancer cells, has been used successfully in the past to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West's SNL performance wearing a MAGA hat culminated in a pro-Trump smear campaign.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after a disjointed appearance praising US President Donald Trump and then announcing that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, "Ghost Town", in his Make America Great Again cap, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often talk to someone who is white and they ask me, "How can you like Trump because he's a racist?"
If I was interested in racism, I would have moved out of America long ago.
SNL's Matt Damon opened with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh mocking his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual harassment allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading.
West even complained to the audience about being teased behind the scenes for his hat.
I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said you should go out in that hat.
They intimidated me!
And they said I was in the sunken place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see a sunken place? I'm gonna wear my Superman cap, 'cause that means they can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His appearances were accompanied by a whistle from the audience at least twice, and the SNL cast was visibly embarrassed, according to one witness who told Variety: "The whole studio was silent".
West was invited to replace Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West raised several questions when she performed "I Love It" dressed as Perrier Glass.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, in a tweet: "One of the bravest spirits: I swear to God, I'm going to do it".
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was just being herself, and that's great.
But I have decided NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or fashion items or by supporting their art) who I believe is promoting an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But we also added it.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
The knife-wielding man at the Belfast restaurant is charged with attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is due to appear at Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the D.A.'s office.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, is finding the exaggerated masculinity harmful.
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, and for his role in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, often wielding a sword.
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against stereotypical cat heroes, noting that such heroes can often make boys feel that a hard-on is needed to earn respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of the harmful effects of over-masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married fellow series co-star Rose Leslie, 31, said he felt it was important to address the problem.
"I am personally deeply affected by this issue. How did the portrayal of masculinity become so distorted?" the actor asked.
 What did we teach men in their childhood about the problem we face today?
Kit also believes that television is responsible for the spread of a distorted image of masculinity, because the shows often feature very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is it that we are born with, and what is it that we learn?
What do the streets and TV send young boys that makes them feel like they're the only way to be men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time and how can we change that?
Because it's clear that something is wrong with young men.
In an interview, Kim stated that after the series' summer season finale, she will not be appearing in any of the previous series or sequels of Game of Thrones because she is tired of the battlefields and the horses.
From November, Kit will star in a reworking of Sam Shepard's True West, a film about a producer and his brother's life of robbery.
The actor said that the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife, Rose, whom he met while making the series.
"I met my wife on the set, so my future family and my life ahead of me are all because of the series", said Kit.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has seen a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials say that this amounts to more than 820,000 cases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by around 40 000.
A significant majority of newly infected people are sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
The disease was previously spread rapidly in parts of China by transfusing infected blood.
However, health officials at a conference in Jünnan province stated that the number of such cases has since dropped to near zero.
Nevertheless, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 from the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to various studies, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men end up marrying a woman because of the country's conservative values.
In many cases, the disease is spread in these relationships due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been providing universal access to HIV medicines as part of a program to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that any of her staff members leaked the data of Republican senators and condemns the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat says the allegations were spread by "extreme right-wing experts" and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters tweeted.
The information released allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted online on Thursday, anonymously, but it was posted from Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on the sexual harassment of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have linked the source IP address to Waters' office, and have also released data on a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reports.
"These allegations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously false", Waters continued.
 My staff member is not liable for any leakage of information, but his right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been violated by fraudulent and false accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and I am clearly lying.
Waters' comments were quickly criticized online, including by Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
"This is a furious denial" by Fleischer.
 It appears that Waters does not have the temperament to be a member of parliament.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, you can't react with anger.
You can't be a coward.
You can't question the prosecution's motives.
You must remain calm and calm.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic Party criticism, who some critics said appeared too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is running as a Republican for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
If that's true, it's a serious matter.
Waters said in his statement that his office had notified the "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies" of the false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified", continued Waters, "and that they are held legally accountable for any actions that endanger or harm any member of my staff".
Johnny English is back in the slammer, or Rowan Atkinson's paralyzing spy game.
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and no exception to this is the action/parody franchise Johnny English, the first part of which, Johnny English, was released in 2003, and the second, Johnny English, a reboot, in 2011.
Will the British nation's new export be sarcastic, self-parody satires in which we revel in our own obvious paralysis?
What is certain is that the eye-popping, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had ammunition enough to make another comeback. It is clear from his name that this comic character was created to be laughed at by the crowds of spectators in theaters of non-English-speaking countries around the world.
Johnny English, of course, is a hard-core secret agent who pretends to be charming with his bizarre manners, so he reminds me a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, sometimes the guy who contributed a single keystroke to the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics with the theme song of Chariots of Fire.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveller Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, who left a mess of chaos everywhere.
There's a couple of good moments in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and then when he got there, the rotors hit his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comic streak is well-represented in the film, but the humor of the film doesn't really work, and it's actually superfluous, because nowadays franchises with a "serious" tone, like the James Bond films or the Mission Impossible series, are also boldly touching on the humor tool.
I feel like the humor of the film is more about the kids, and to me, Johnny English's lame, failed adventures don't reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings to the silent scenes of Mr. Bean.
The film starts with the immortal: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal has broken into the super-secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identities of all the British agents, much to the horror of the acting agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got one such small role in the film.
This may be the final nail in the coffin of the arrogant and divisive prime minister, whose political popularity is in ruins anyway: Emma Thompson basically plays Theresa May, and brings out the best in her otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisers tell him that since the identities of all active agents have been revealed, he should hire a retired agent to do the job.
This retired agent is, of course, the double-handed Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher at a prestigious school since his retirement, but he's teaching the kids about spying, which is not the subject of the curriculum. There are, of course, some funny scenes here, where English explains the basics of spying in a kind of "Rock School" way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he is reunited with his former, long-suffering gunman, Bough, now played by Ben Miller, for an emergency briefing.
Bough has since married, and she's married to a submarine captain who's always got his mouth on. The captain is played by Vicki Pepperdine, who's destined for much better roles.
So the two-handed Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's National Security Service are back in action, and they confront Ophelia Bullet, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as the woman of their destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly being lured by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be the man who can solve Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown missions: masquerading as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, then sneak into the midst of an incredible upheaval on the luxury yacht Volta, and English unleashes reality hell when he tries to explore Volta's apartment using a VR headset.
These stations are needed to get to the end, but as fun and exciting as it was, it's a little too much of a children's movie.
The end result is pretty mediocre.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I wondered if the British film industry could finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of her talent.
The British Labour Party denies introducing a four-day work week while paying British workers five days' pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: the introduction of a four-day work week, all in the form of workers working for five days' pay.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the AI revolution by giving executives extra days off as a result of increased income.
The plan would give workers three days off, while taking home the same amount as before.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party's economic program, which aims to put the balance of power in the country on the side of the workers.
The idea of a four-day workweek is also supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, which believes that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day work week is an idea that fits well with the party's program to shift the balance of power in the economy towards workers, and it also fits in with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, the Green Party already campaigned in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day work week.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not one of the policies supported by the party and the issue is not even on the agenda".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at last week's Labour conference.
McDonnell said he's determined to take back power from the faceless CEOs and the profiteers of the corporate world.
If the shadow finance minister's plans were to come to fruition, the water companies' shareholders would not get their full profits back, as a Labour government would impose "discounts" as punishment for alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he planned to include workers on the board and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds that would transfer 10% of the shares of private-sector companies to employees, who would receive 500 important dividends a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes have revealed whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on Kavanaugh's election as chief justice will be held at least a week later than originally scheduled, and the question is whether the outcome of the investigation could disconcert Republican lawmakers enough to not support Kavanaugh.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said that.
I said that before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called you after the case broke out, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was firm and clear.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be solid.
"I've already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it's going to take some very serious charges to change my mind", Graham said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has strongly denied the allegations that Graham added to his address to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the individuals named by Dr. Ford have substantiated the allegations.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will come out.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it managed to reduce poverty?
Saturday, the annual music event, the Global Citizen Festival, kicks off in New York City, where world-class musicians will perform to stand up for a truly noble cause: the global eradication of poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to the Great Plaza in Central Park, where participants will not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes's performances, but also draw attention to the event's real purpose: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project, run by an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by engaging more people in the active fight against poverty.
Free tickets to the concert are available to those (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertake certain tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a leading politician, making a phone call, or any other meaningful activity that can draw attention to the project's goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen actually been in achieving its goals over the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective way to reward people with concert tickets to convince others that action is needed, or is it just another form of what's called "clicktivism", where people feel they've made a meaningful contribution to a cause by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, more than 19 million actions have been carried out by project sponsors, according to Global Citizen data, serving a wide range of purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have helped world leaders allocate $37 billion to policies and commitments to fight poverty, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements that stemmed from their actions, of which $10 billion had already been paid or raised through fundraising.
The group estimates that the money raised has already directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and developers aimed at helping children reach their potential.The organization pledged $35 million to help end hunger in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, and the support of donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can eradicate social injustice and malnutrition from the history books", said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for Power of Nutrition, to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and their children, the government has allocated funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions posted on the Global Citizen website is: Why do you think that extreme poverty can be eradicated?
According to Global Citizen, "It's going to be a long and difficult journey, one that sometimes gets stuck and sometimes fails.
But like the civil rights and anti-segregation movements of the past, we will achieve our goal because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will be performing at this year's event in New York, and the hosts will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Minister: US would use naval blockade to block Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington could even deploy the Navy to prevent Russian energy carriers from entering the market, so that Russian energy cannot reach the Middle East, for example", U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke was quoted as saying by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's active presence in Syria  in particular in relation to Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government  is merely an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
"I think they're only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", Zinke said in a statement.
And the Home Secretary says there are ways to stop the Russians.
"The United States can use its navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and can block them if necessary, so that Russian energy can not enter the markets", Zinke said.
Zinke was addressing an event organized by the nonprofit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which defines itself as the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, noting that they were practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be economically sanctioned in much the same way: by using existing energy sources and introducing new ones", Zinke said, while calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing to the country's dependence on fossil energy sources.
The statements are consistent with the Trump administration's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option to European consumers.
That's why top Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are convincing Germany to back off the "unsuitable" pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if realized, would make Moscow "a twenty-two".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington is so vehemently opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is an expression of unfair competition.
"I assume we are on the same page that energy should not be used for pressure exercises and that consumers should be allowed to choose their suppliers freely", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The American attempt to persuade the Germans to go ahead with the project was a failure.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Confederation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, as well as to stay out of the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a problem when a third country interferes in our energy affairs", said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), after the recent meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is seriously considering running for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would seriously consider running for president.
Warren in Massachusetts, at a town meeting in Holyoke, confirmed he's considering going.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix the government that's broken, and it's time for a woman to be president", Warren said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm seriously considering running for president.
At the town hall, Warren criticized Donald Trump, saying he thought he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am following with deep concern what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", Warren said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Well, of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday found that a majority of Warren's Massachusetts voters do not think Warren should run for president in 2020.
A recent poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe found that 58 percent of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren with a good chance of winning the election said the senator should not run for president until after the election.
Thirty-two percent of the voters support Warren's candidacy.
The poll shows that the majority of respondents, 38%, would support the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, and 48% would oppose it.
The 2020 presidential election has also seen the names of high-ranking Democratic politicians, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to an Associated Press report, Biden will decide by January whether to run.
Sarah Palin Track Palin referred to her PTSD at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
She was arrested on a domestic violence charge Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he got home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are returning home with", Sarah Palin told an audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
He called the arrest of Palin's son the elephant in the room, and said that his son, like other war veterans, had returned changed, hardened, and was constantly wondering if he had enough respect for the service his comrades, pilots and every other member of the military had done for the country.
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on a domestic assault charge against a woman, and Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said that Track Palin was reportedly involved in a domestic assault with a gun and drunk.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 states and Washington D.C. support a judicial review of the new U.S. immigration policy, which would not grant asylum to those fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different states and Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging his policies in court, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, a case initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been released.
The plaintiff claimed that she was abused by her partner and by the sons of a violent gang, but on July 20, U.S. officials denied her asylum request.
She's in custody in Texas.
Prosecutors in Grace's supporters have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as places where many asylum seekers to the United States come from, as these countries are a persistent problem of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. immigration policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
Under federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed in the light of the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle would violate this principle  the expert letter states.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that the policy of rejecting immigration is detrimental to the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and  fill the lowest-level jobs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is for people who leave their country because of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or because of a well-founded fear of persecution", Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum was not created to solve all the problems that people face every day around the world, no matter how serious they are.
Desperate rescue operation in Paluu, double the death toll, rescue teams racing against time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more hopeless.
"Everyone is very nervous", says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she calms her feverish son in one of the evacuation centers in disaster-hit Palu.
The paramedics are bringing bodies in every minute.
We barely have any drinking water.
Some residents returned to their ruined homes to retrieve what was left of the flooded property.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are unable to care for people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken spine and shoulder, were taken to the Palupua Military Hospital, where they were treated outside the hospital building due to the strong aftershocks.
The man's eyes filled with light as he recalled how the fifth-floor hotel room in which he and his wife and daughter were staying was engulfed in the devastating quake.
There was no time to run.
I think I was trapped in the collapsed walls, "Harris told the Associated Press, then added that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The American ambassador accuses China of spreading propaganda against the country
The Chinese ambassador to the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the American press, a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily that emphasized the mutual benefits of US-China trade relations.
US President Donald Trump cited an advertisement in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest selling newspaper, last Wednesday, accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusations of Beijing trying to interfere in the US election mark a new phase in Washington's increasingly aggressive crackdown on China, some US officials told Reuters, aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, there is an intensifying trade war between Beijing and Washington, with tariffs on each other's imports increasing.
American and Chinese experts say that the Chinese tariffs imposed at the start of the trade war were a response to the efforts of exporters in states where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former multi-term governor of Iowa, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses, as Iowa exports significant amounts of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that "China is further marginalizing our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"The Chinese government is exploiting America's cherished tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
 If you go to a newspaper store in Beijing, however, you will find few critical articles.  The Chinese press does not reflect at all the different, divergent opinions of the Chinese people about the increasingly dire prospects for the Chinese economy's growth, since the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.
Branstad added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to take down his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans could alienate women voters before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh scandal.
Analysts say it could backfire if many senior Republican politicians take on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid sexual harassment allegations, potentially losing support among women voters ahead of the midterm elections.
The case sparked heated emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements are irrevocable, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute FBI investigation initiated by Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow, or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told a Washington, D.C.-based newspaper on Friday.
Mic reported that Friday morning, in the Senate corridor, some protesters chanted "November is coming!" because the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be incredibly high", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
Many people say he's been very tall, and he's been.
But it can be even higher, especially among suburban women voters and young people (aged 18-29) who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not go to the polls.
Even before Ford's public testimony, analysts speculated that he might strike back at Republicans if they continued to support the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.
"The Republican Party has fallen on hard ground", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets appointed, but how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated Ford", said Guy Cecil, director of Democratic-election aid for Priorities USA.
But it seems that Americans are quite divided on whether they believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony to be true, and Kavanaugh is believed by a little more than Ford.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony completely or more, and 35% of respondents in Kavanaugh's case gave the same answer.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed that about Ford.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's allegations, as well as those of Kavanaugh's co-accuser, Deborah Ramirez, writes the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath a week ago before the Senate Judiciary Committee that when he was 17, Kavanaugh molested him while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party in the 1980s when they were both students at Yale.
The inventor of the Web would launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt is a company that's built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access each piece of information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data warehouse", also known as POD.
This may include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all running from the same browser at the same time.
What's unique about personal online repositories is that it's entirely up to the user to decide who gets access to their data.
The company calls this "implementing the right of individuals to self-determination over their data".
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, said the company's mission is to provide the resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contracted developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.

Bernard Vann, a First World War Victorian Crusader, was honored
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victoria Cross is being celebrated in his hometown 100 years after his heroic deeds in World War I.
The Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battles of Bellenglise and Lecourt on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew that he had earned the highest decoration in the British armed forces.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "symbolically significant" that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather's dignified act.
According to the London Gazette, the Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, amidst thick fog and heavy gun and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed to the front lines and led the battalion with extraordinary heroism, then single-handedly stormed a field artillery detachment, killing three of its members.
The Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
"I know I'll never be able to match what my grandfather did, and it taught me humility", said 72-year-old Michael Vann of his grandfather.
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also commemorated the stone.
Michael Vann said he was honoured to be a part of the celebration, adding: "The courage of a true hero is shown by how many people pay their respects to him later".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 broadcast, but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch the thrilling Bellator 206 and you missed the broadcast.
The San José show featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live as part of the main competition show at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, to the surprise of the English audience, Peppa Pig was on the show instead of the match.
This was a problem for many who were kept up until the early hours of the morning because of the clashes.
A child cartoon he posted instead of an MMA match was dubbed by one of his fans as "some kind of sick joke" on Twitter.
"State regulations prevent the channel from broadcasting this type of content at 6 a.m. so they had to switch to children's shows", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of communications and marketing, in a statement.
Yes, it's Peppa, the pig time.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, has promised that in the future, the show will be re-scheduled to accommodate UK viewers.
"I think we can solve this problem by repeating it", Coker said.
 But since it is 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, which is Monday in their country, we cannot remedy the situation.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when the show went live, there were a lot of messages coming in, and most of them weren't very friendly.
At first we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the error.
But that's not what happened. We had a legal problem.
But I can promise you, next time, nothing like this will happen.
Instead of the previous six, there will be only five matches in the program. We really wanted to please the audience, but we've got ourselves accounted for.
It was an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic high jumper Tom Daley has stated that as a young man he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said it wasn't until high school that he realized that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he told host Lauren Laverne that he was a gay rights activist, giving hope to others.
She added that since becoming a parent, she's been less interested in the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, was unable to attend for several months due to illness.
In his first show at Laverne, Daley, who was invited as a shipwreck, said that as a young man he felt inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He stated: "To this day, it is the feeling of inferiority and of being different that gives me the perseverance and strength to achieve my successes.
He wanted to prove he was worth something, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation came out.
The two-time Olympic bronze jumper has become a well-known figure in the LGBT community, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
She said she spoke up because she felt lucky to be able to live her life openly without negative consequences, and she wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said she was "totally surprised" when she fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she first met in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar-winning screenwriter, who is 20 years her senior, got married last year, and she claims that the age difference never was a problem between them.
"When you go through so much at a young age", she said, "you were in your first Olympics at 14 and your father died of cancer three years later", "it's hard to find someone your own age who has gone through such extreme experiences".
The couple adopted a baby boy in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, according to Daley, completely upended his outlook on life.
If I'd been asked this question last year, I would have said, "The most important thing is to win a gold medal".
But you know what I've learned, there are more important things than Olympic gold.
My Olympic gold medal, Robbie.
The baby was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley's statement said his father was unwilling to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't answer him, "Dad, you're not going to be in the front row anymore".
I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment I could not accept that my father was not invulnerable.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I felt like this is what I've been dreaming of all my life, to be able to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, and it's the best feeling I've ever had", he said.
The song "Heather Small Proud" helped her prepare for the Olympics, and to this day, she still feels a tingle when she hears it.
Desert Island Discs is on Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was in bad shape and was on the bench Saturday night at the Ryder Cup.
Phil Mickelson of the United States may set a record by playing in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll need to get back in shape if he doesn't want this milestone to be remembered as an unpleasant experience.
Mickelson is playing a record 12 times at the biennial event, but due to his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-a-side matches, he was sent off by team captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being the center of attention in the big leagues, where five wins are the focus, as so many times the United States has had to fight for victory, he now spends half of the day cheering for his team, the other half on the field practicing and trying to correct the mistakes that weaken his game.
He was never one of the best hitters at the peak of his career, so the 48-year-old is not really comfortable on the narrow course of Le Golf National, where the high grass pays a very high price for misses.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact-playing English champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has teamed up with starter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 singles, start strong, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk claims to trust the player, but what else could he say?
"He is fully aware of his role in the making of today, he slapped me on the back, he hugged me, and he promised to be ready tomorrow", Fury said.
- Very confident.
He's one of the greatest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and in the past week.
I didn't basically give him two fights.
I had more planned, but in the circumstances, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be on the court, like everybody else.
Mickelson's Sunday performance will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
That puts an end to a Ryder Cup series that is far behind the individual performance of the player.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk stressed that the presence of the veteran player also brings tangible benefits to the team.
"Funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with others, great team member", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed the games against him, and it's good to see that.
His presence goes beyond the strict sense of the word.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows that they can easily lose their advantage
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if you get a significant head start on the final day of the Ryder Cup, which is the final day of singles, it's easy to get turned down by luck.
The Danish player made his debut in a 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point lead over the Americans, and then at the end they just managed to keep a hair's breadth of the lead to a 141⁄2131⁄2 victory.
"We must always remind ourselves that although we gained a big advantage in Valderrama, we won by a single stroke, and we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we were eventually eliminated", said Bjørn, pictured here, after his 2018 Class 5 3 victory on Friday and yesterday, which led to a 10 6th place finish at Le Golf National.
Just think of the previous years' competitions and you can see that the game is not over.
Tomorrow, you'll have to play with full force.
So come on, and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to focus on right now.
As I said before, I'm mostly focused on our 12 players, but we also have to look at the other side, who happen to be some of the greatest players in the world.
Bjørn, who was proud of the team's performance on the difficult track, added: "I would never make predictions in a situation like this.
Tomorrow is a whole different day.
Then it's all about individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It's a great feeling to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand out as an individual, you get to see in every way what kind of golfer you really are.
You have to make sure that the players understand that they're going to be on the field tomorrow.
They'll have to cut themselves off from their partner, who will also have to be at his best.
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Fury, the captain of the opposing team, expressly believes that his players will perform better individually than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury has personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurrection: he was on the winning side in Brooklyn, then he was on the losing side after the European team's bravely performed what was described as the "miracle" of Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how he motivated the players before the final day of Ben Crenshaw's captaincy in 1999.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we're best off with a quick start, like we saw in Brooklyn, like we saw in Medina.
If one team is really into it, it puts a lot of pressure on the other team's players during the midfield.
We've arranged the lineup accordingly and prepared our players to perform a real miracle tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with leading the way in the reversal effort, playing Rory McIlroy in the first leg, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
I also chose the sequence because I think that's how the image is framed from beginning to end, which Bjørn attached to the individual line-up.
The delivery of Germany's latest warship has been delayed again.
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to enter service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, it is still at least until next year.
The launch of the flagship of the all-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the Rhineland-Palatinate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a spokesman for the army.
The ship was originally scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but ongoing delays have made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007 to replace the ageing Bréma-class frigates.
We know it'll be armed with a high-powered cannon, and it'll be equipped with various anti-aircraft and anti-submarine missiles and stealth technology, including a silencer that reduces radar, infrared and acoustic signals from the ship.
Another important feature is that they require less maintenance, which means that in practice these latest frigates can be deployed away from home ports for up to two years.
However, due to the project's continuing delay, it is possible that these high-tech warships, with which Germany could also feel its power overseas, will be obsolete by the time they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
Not much information has been released on the reasons for the return, but the German media have reported several critical "software and hardware flaws" that render the warship unusable in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies are a major problem, as the Baden-Württemberg-class warships will only have 120 seamen, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was extremely overweight, which impaired its performance and made it impossible for the Navy to make further modifications later.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is reportedly twice as heavy as similar class ships commissioned by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the defective parts, the increasing overall cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the project cost has already reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial project was expected to cost €2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are particularly significant in view of the warnings that Germany's naval presence is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's national defense committee, recently admitted that the navy is running out of warships in good working order.
The official said that the problem had become a self-inflicted disaster, as the old ships had to be dismantled, but there were no more ships to replace the lost ones.
It was concerned that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy's line.
The National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats
A new study is underway at a Scottish farm to find out how bats exploit the landscape's unique features when hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals, which could be useful for future conservation initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will study the behaviour of common and soprano dwarf beetles, brown long-eared beetles and water bats at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at appropriate points in the area to record bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will be using handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
By analyzing the audio in detail, we can determine the frequency of the bat's sounds and what species are doing.
Researchers are also producing a habitat map and report to help determine in detail how animals behave in relation to the landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how species use them.
This information helps to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management activities, such as grassland development, and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other species concerned.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
Construction and development work disrupts the animals' sleeping places and reduces their habitat.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also risk factors for them, as are exposed foam papers, certain chemical processes used in building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually completely blind.
However, because of their nocturnal predatory nature, they rely much more on their hearing than on their sight when hunting.
Their sophisticated ultrasonic feedback technology can pinpoint the exact location of insects and any objects in the field.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens, and 76,000 acres of land nationwide, takes the bat issue very seriously.
They work with ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies and site surveys and occasionally participate in rescue operations.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is a great place for bats", he said.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that's necessary for a good living space.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, and thanks to work here and elsewhere, we're learning more about what they need to feel good.
He also stressed the importance of making sure that bat populations are present before building renovations, since the destruction of a single bat colony could result in the extinction of 400 females and juveniles, leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bates are protected animals, and their destruction, harassment, and habitat degradation are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has also asked for the public's help.
He stated: "There is still a lot we don't know about bats, and we have almost no information on the population status of most native species".
Ronaldo denies rape charges, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape against him "fake news", and believes others are trying to use his name to "get into the public eye".
The footballer's lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which dropped the charges.
The Portuguese player and Juventus's channel were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorra, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
The woman said the athlete paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video hours after the allegations came to light that the news was "false".
No, no, no, no and no.
Everything that's been fabricated about me today is a lie, told to the camera by the five-time golden globe player.
They want to use my name to get into the public eye.
It happens.
They want to be famous in my name, that's the life of public actors.
I'm a happy man and my life is fine", the player added with a smile.
Due to the allegations, which have been described as "unacceptable" and "a suspicion of privacy violations", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters reports.
According to Christian Schertz, the player will claim compensation for the moral damage caused in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights committed in recent years.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man allegedly raped the woman, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got down on his knees after the incident and told him he was 99 percent a good boy, except for an unprecedented 1 percent.
Based on the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that they were consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and a hospital to have his injuries examined, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he feared retribution and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the agreement, as the trauma of the case in question continues to plague her.
Ronaldo was on the verge of being signed from Real Madrid to Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer, he was bought by Italian giant Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever mourn the loss of car factories
The UK will forever regret losing its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added: 'Toyota UK is alarmed by the statement made to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the carmaker will be forced to temporarily stop production at its Burnston plant near Derby.
"We need to make a deal", Clark said.
A Japanese carmaker says that if there is a no-deal Brexit, delays at the borders could lead to job losses.
The Burnaby plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a shutdown of production at the plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnstown.
Other UK carmakers (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concerns about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its Minik plant in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The biggest concern for carmakers is that a no-deal Brexit will create supply chain risks.
Toyota's production line is running on a timely basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, industry officials say border disruptions could lead to production delays and parts shortages.
Toyota argued that it would be impossible to store more than one day's supply of spare parts at its plant in Derbyshire and that production should therefore be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for the future relationship with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, is precisely designed to avoid delays at the border.
"We need the agreement, we want the best possible terms, which will not only allow us to enjoy the fruits of our current successes, but also open up new opportunities", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
 Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our currently highly successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long the production would last, but warned that the cumulative costs could undermine the competitiveness of the factory in the long term, which could eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnston plant for 24 years and now represents the Unite union, union members are increasingly worried: In my experience, jobs lost at this time will never be recovered.
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations".
The Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, the White House said.
The high-profile meeting between Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump may be postponed for another week as the debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence in the election, possible ties between Trump advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months, there has been speculation in Washington whether Trump will finally fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
According to a report in the New York Times this month, Rosenstein was considering coming to the meeting wired to record the conversation with the president, and the question was raised as to whether the 25th Amendment would allow Trump to be removed.
Rosenstein denied the allegations.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, and there was a rumor that he was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then making a presentation at the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump stated that he was "not happy" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was visiting on the Fox News Sunday show.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: "We don't have a date yet, we could set it this week, but in light of the Supreme Court cases, I see some chance of another week's delay".
We'll find out soon enough, and I'll, as always, let the press know.
Some journalists, however, were skeptical of the statement, as Sanders had not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the anchor, asked me why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of press conferences was not due to a dislike of television reporters' "sensationalistic" behavior, but added: "I don't dispute the fact that I am indeed sensationalistic".
He then hinted that direct meetings between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
"The president gives more Q&A interviews than any previous president has ever done", he added, without backing up his claim, "We've looked at the numbers".
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's light years better than talking to me.
We've been trying to get this sort of thing done a lot, and we've had a lot of these in the last few weeks, so instead of the White House press conferences, you can talk to the President of the United States in person.
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when he leaves the White House or attends public events, perhaps press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
But private press conferences are rare.
Why, perhaps, can be inferred from what happened this week, when the president made a disorderly and sometimes bizarre appearance in New York to the assembled press.
The head of the health department has written to NHS Scotland's EU staff about concerns over Brexit.
The head of the health wallet in the country expressed in a letter his gratitude to the NHS staff in Scotland who had come from EU countries and stressed that he hoped they would stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's expected withdrawal.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of EU citizens applying for settled status in the decentralised public service.
In his letter, Mr Freeman wrote: The UK and EU continued their negotiations on withdrawal during the summer, with a decision expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also begun to prepare a possible no-deal scenario.
I realize how distressing this must be for you.
So I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of their country of origin.
Our staff from different EU Member States and other countries bring valuable experience and expertise to help the health portfolio work, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would love to have you here.
Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He walked to the shore and just collapsed", Reed said.
The coaching staff and medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines, then placed him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
An official at Tennessee State in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a reporter for WSMV, that Abercrombie is recovering from the surgery performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he doesn't have any further details about the type and extent of the injury at this time, while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore suspended for a year, is in his first season with Tennessee State, where he transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five successful starts on Saturday before leaving the track, making him 18th in the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on properties bought in the UK
Under Tory's new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees for properties purchased in the UK, and the additional revenue from this would support homeless people,
This move would negate Corbyn's success among young voters.
The increase in the levy is intended for non-UK taxpayers
The Treasury estimates that this would generate £120 million a year in income for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on properties purchased in the UK, and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May is set to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely to offset the successes achieved by Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, with his promises of affordable housing and measures targeting high-income earners.
The increase will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will be used to fight homelessness.
The surcharge on the current tax, which is to be charged in addition to the higher tax on second homes or properties purchased for expenditure two years ago, may be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects annual revenues of £120 million from the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK nationals, causing a significant increase in prices, which makes it increasingly difficult for first-time homebuyers.
Many of the country's wealthy neighbourhoods have become "ghost towns", especially in the capital, as many foreign buyers spend much of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help young people prepare for their first home.
He personally blames the construction giants for keeping property prices high, who have become accustomed to buying up land and leaving it in the ground, and he has asked May to remove quotas on affordable housing and do something about the embarrassment of the housing market in the country.
Corbyn has made some remarkable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including wage controls and an end to unjustified evictions.
It would also give the councils more rights and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I wanted to dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the English dream and making life better for every generation.
And to do that, we need to regulate the real estate market.
Britain remains as open as ever to those who wish to live, work and raise a family here.
However, it is not right that individuals living outside the country and companies with foreign interests should be able to buy property as easily as hard-working English citizens.
The dream of home has become almost unattainable for too many, and the disgraceful condition of homelessness has become too accessible.
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to be the manager of the Scottish team".
Jack Ross, Sunderland manager, has said his greatest ambition is to manage the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach is keen to take on the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in the top flight, just three points behind the top-ranked side.
He then moved his seat to the Stadium of Light, having successfully returned St Mirren to the Scottish First Division the previous season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"Unfortunately, I only made it to the reserve team", Ross told BBC Sportsound.
When I was a kid, I used to watch the Scottish team play a lot in Hampden with my dad, and something always stuck with them.
But now I have no chance but to succeed as a club manager.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not too keen on following in the footsteps of such big names, and has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
I'm measuring my success right now by whether I can get this team back to the top flight.
If you look at the structure and facilities of the club, it's definitely in the top league.
It won't be easy to get back, but I'm more than likely going to consider my activities here successful if I can get the club back.
Ross' managerial career began just three years ago, after spending time as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aola to their first ever promotion after the team were relegated to the Third Division, and won the championship the following season with near-relegation St Mirren.
Ross says he feels more confident now than he has in his playing career, whether at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
It was a defining moment, remembering his time as coach of Alloa.
I clearly thought that I was more into managing than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I did well, I made a pretty good living out of it, and I actually had some really memorable moments.
But sometimes the life of a gambler is very hard.
There's a lot to go through every single week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of my job, but I have to deal with the management responsibilities.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've gotten into it, I feel like I'm in the best shape of my adult life.
The full interview will be broadcast on the Sportsound programme on Sunday 30 September from 12pm to 1pm local time on Radio Scotland.
One study found that Saturday afternoons at 5:30 am are the best time to drink beer.
The summer heat wave has seen a significant increase in the number of pubs in distressed England, but the pressure on restaurant chains is still very heavy.
Based on the data collected, pubs and bars' revenues increased by 2,7% in July, while restaurants' decreased by 4,8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA business consultancy which compiles the statistics, stated: The sunny season and England's longer-than-expected World Cup appearance continued the trend of the previous month in July, when pubs saw a 2.8% increase in revenue, with an even greater decline in restaurants.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant revenue in June worsened further in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly sell alcohol, were the best performers, producing a higher rate of growth than even the decline in restaurants.
Pubs that served more food were also uncomfortably affected by prolonged sun exposure, though not nearly as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems people are more in the mood for drinking at this time.
Revenues from drinks in company-run pubs and bars rose by 6.6% this month, while revenues from food fell by 3%.
According to Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality RSM analyst: These results follow a trend that has been emerging since the end of April.
The main revenue drivers in the entertainment and hospitality industry continue to be the weather and major community and sporting events.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains are in a difficult situation and that the annual decline in revenues of 4,8% could be particularly painful due to the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have been worse for restaurant operators, and it will only be seen in time whether the more moderate weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area.
The total revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2,7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK catering sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is widely accepted as an industry benchmark, collects and analyses performance data from a group of 47 operators with a turnover of more than 9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account that they keep from their parents
One survey found that one in five children (by age 11) had a social media account that they kept secret from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows that the number of Insta websites is increasing
The news has increased the fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students said they had a "main" account that their parents could see
One in five children (as young as 11 years old) has a social media account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a surge in the number of "Insta" followers, which refer to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has increased the fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students said they have a flawless main account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenage profile that said "Rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC), representing Headmasters and Headmistresses of independent schools, shows that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having a private account.
"I find it alarming that so many teenagers feel they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can't reach them", said HMC president Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletics Association.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, believes that the sport's decision-makers will be invaluable in his extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Eilidh is held in high esteem in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and his presence will help the development of Scottish athletics", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to really help the work of the Scottish Sports Directors".
The American athlete, who regularly appears as an expert on the BBC, won two of four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, but was forced to use a wheelchair because of a temporary cerebral hemorrhage.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would be a matter of time before I recovered.
I'm doing some testing, but I've made a full recovery, I can walk again, I'm going to agility training today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages.
Breast advertising comparing mothers to cows divides the online community
A company that makes vacuum cleaners has sparked a heated online debate over an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to calves.
Elvie claims to have developed "the world's first silent, wearable breast pump" and advertised the product in an ironic commercial that cited music videos that showed the freedom the device gives mothers who are cutting off their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cowshed full of straw, while the lyrics of the song are heard in the background, which say: "Yes, I'm going to die, I don't even have a dick yet, and if you hadn't noticed, these aren't my tits, these are my breasts".
And the chorus is, "Pump, pump, so the kid eats big, pump, pump, I'll blow the girls' heads off".
The ad posted on the company's Facebook page quickly became a crossfire of online debate.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of mixed reviews, with many saying the ad is a mockery of the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's very tasteless to advertise a product with cows.
Like us, their bodies only produce milk when they give birth, but their calves are taken away from them within days", recalls one speaker.
The Elvie suction cup can be placed discreetly in a suction cup (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says: "Yes, it's terrible for the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell breast milk to mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "A totally insensitive advertisement".
Others have come to the defense of the ad, with one woman confessing that she thought the video was "really funny".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it right away if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a stupid commercial, so I'm not even trying to look at it anymore.
The product is brilliant.
According to another commentator: "It's a funny advertisement for mothers who are breastfeeding at work or in a toilet, who feel like a cow because of it.
It's not the dairy industry that's being praised or condemned.
At the end of the video, the women show that they had their discreet suction cups in their bras while they danced.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use vacuum cleaners sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, uses no wires or tubes, and can be placed discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their baby in their hands, or even move out while breast-feeding.
According to Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director of Mother, "The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing out the parallel between women who are breastfeeding and head cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using suckers and to provide a humorous sense of freedom that our suckers offer in comparison.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner has been in the news.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother of two dressed as Marta Jakubowski stepped on the runway while using the product.
Hundreds of child migrants were secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of child migrants in detention has reached a record high, while the number of monthly border crossings has remained unchanged, partly because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder for them to find a welcoming home.
The adopters are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that their chances of staying in the country would be jeopardized if they applied to take the children in.
This threat was further increased in June when it was announced that parents applying for asylum and adults living in the same household with them would have to give their fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress last week that dozens of people were arrested for applying to take in unaccompanied minors.
The bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
80% of those applying for asylum and those living in the same household are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are convicted criminals.
We will therefore continue to search for such individuals, Albence said.
In order to speed up the process for children, new rules have been introduced that some of them must appear in court within a month of being detained instead of the previous 60 days, social workers say.
Many people report to court via videoconference call instead of appearing in person to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not grant legal protection, the immigrant is deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and those working in the system have reported that the longer the detention, the more nervous and depressed the children become, and the more likely they are to break out or attempt to escape.
Advocates say that these risks are only compounded by a larger facility like the one in Torrillo, where the number of children makes it harder to screen out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if children are not given enough time to prepare or to say goodbye to friends before being transferred to such a facility, they are exposed to even greater trauma.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish forces
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homelands despite the country's eight-year civil war.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces had illegally entered Syrian territory citing the fight against terrorism and would be treated as such.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the General Assembly.
Moualem has demonstrated that the war on terror is coming to an end in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He stated that Damascus will continue its holy fight to cleanse the entire territory of Syria from terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
As regards refugees, Moualem argued that the conditions are right for their return and that only some Western countries are encouraging irrational fears, deterring refugees from returning home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help the population return home", he said.
They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a combat zone around the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, could facilitate further talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a full-scale offensive against the province of three million people.
Moualem also stressed that the agreement "set clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed only against jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "must be eradicated".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will be convened soon to prepare a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem said that the Syrian government's participation in the committee, including only the revision of certain articles of the current constitution, was acceptable under conditions, and warned against any outside interference in the process.
That's why they're going to re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will almost certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless what many liberal observers hope is realized and a impeachment or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
We can be sure this will be the most dramatic presidential finale of all time.
For now, though, viewers are enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time viewership has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show is the most-watched cable show with 3.5 million viewers on the evening of the most important news days.
"We're drawn to it like fire because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's "The Designated Survivor", in which a low-ranking cabinet minister sits in the presidential chair after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Veteran comic book writer Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different view.
Here's a quote from a Boston taxi driver before the 2016 election:
The driver said he was voting for Trump.
Scovell asked him why.
"Because you made me laugh", the driver replied.
It's the power of chaos to entertain.
Of course, unlike television series, stories coming out of Washington could determine the fate of cases like Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the stability of the global economy.
Only a very narrow layer can ignore these facts.
But it's no longer part of responsible reporting, when we've been watching for six hours a week a series of videos about the authenticity of anonymous backstage conversations used in Bob Woodward's book "Fear", or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (his "assorted suit of flesh-and-blood arrogance" as The Washington Post puts it), or the consequences of his description of Stormy Daniels Trump's, uh, anatomy.
What I'm used to is that from now on, I'm always going to think of Super Mario.
"It's a little bit like watching a reality show where you get something new every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Hostage Stars".
If you miss one part, you'll be out of the game.
When I arrived in Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, sunny, 88-degree weather on Kaua'i, and he was still in there, locked in his house watching MSNBC, recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee began, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows, a lot of people said this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization", Fleiss quoted.
I thought they were joking, but they were right.

Both parties are pouring money into the closest race to a midterm congressional election.
It's no surprise that in Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, both parties are spending countless dollars after two active congressmen are running for the same seat after redrawing congressional districts.
One of the contenders for the newly redrawn Pittsburgh suburban district is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a midterm election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently the representative for Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which has significant overlap with the current 17th district.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous district boards had been manipulated to Republican advantage.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), almost bid against each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after he narrowly won the highly publicized March midterm election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, with Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, then dropped the plan.
Diplomats say the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has barely responded.
Donald Trump had good spirits with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed the Trump Organization leadership team out of there.
The State Department has recalled senior U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for their recent decision not to support Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punitive measures, such as cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have had a painful impact on the Central American country, which also has a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As the closed-door meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues that would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary objective of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which made it clear that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which diplomats say is a clear indication of the importance the administration holds for the event.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no condemnation or punitive measures taken by Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was reported anonymously by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats.
Their accounts were corroborated by outside analysts close to the administration, who also chose to remain anonymous.
Historical experience
The next blow may be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice in any way... as many of the facts that have come to light suggest.
Mueller's investigation is also reportedly looking into whether Trump's team cooperated with Russia in an attempt to influence the election.
If the Democrats win a majority in Congress, they'll probably try to hold Trump accountable, who may face the judgment of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are many uncertainties, and Trump's fall is far from inevitable... as is his European allies.
The length of the fight depends on the weighty decisions that must be made on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, several German officers were ready to assassinate Hitler, only waiting for the West to side with the Czechs in Munich.
The aid was not provided, so the bloodshed of the following years could not be prevented.
At historical turning points like this, the inevitable development of democracy will either accelerate or slow down.
We can identify several such turning points in America today.
What are we going to do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been vacant since last year, when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested recording conversations with the president and suggested that Trump was unfit to hold office.
Rosenstein said The Times was inaccurate in its reporting of the events.
How do we react if the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is biased or incomplete and he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question is, in the midterm elections, are we voting for a Congress that is willing to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy faces a long winter.
I'm confident that it won't, especially given my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once housed the building that served as my embassy home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on the Sabbath on a swastika-shaped table.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident ahead of Rapid Wien
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and a win over the Austrians after an unexpected draw against Villarreal, Spain, could secure them a place in Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans has been ruled out of the season due to a knee injury until the 2-2 win over Villarreal, but he feels that based on this result, the Rangers can assign him even bolder goals.
"It was a big point against a great team, Villarreal", said the 31-year-old.
We believed we could score a point, and we did.
Maybe we could have scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the tie.
They were better in the first half, and we were in the second half.
There's another big European game on Thursday.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good in their last game, but with our fans behind us, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was a tough year, I was injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We've got a good team, the guys are enjoying the game, training is going well.
I hope that if we do our best, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results.
Many women worry about not saving enough for their old age
The survey respondents had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, but only a small percentage of them told their family members about it.
According to a Nationwide survey, only half of those surveyed discussed the expected cost of their care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't usually bring it up", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's what you should do.
First, discuss with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to care for you properly if you do not let them know what your needs are in time.
Choose where and what care you want with your counselor and your family, and these decisions will have a significant impact on your future costs.
Get a financial advisor involved, who can give you helpful suggestions on how to pay for your planned benefits.
Funding can be through a traditional old-age insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy combined with savings, which can cover expenses or use your own wealth as cover... if you have the resources.
Prepare legal documents: This will cut off the possibility of future litigation.
Trust a representative, a trusted person, to act on your behalf on health matters, oversee your medical care, and make sure everything goes according to your expectations even when you are unable to communicate.
You should also put someone in charge of your finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and makes sure that bills are paid when you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the little details too: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about your medications and allergies?
Keep this information in writing so that it is available at all times.
It's not just the financial issues that need to be cleared up, it's not just whoever your doctor put it to, Martin.
What medication are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned.
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was walking home from his evening program.
The victim, in his 40s, was attacked in the Ilfracombe section of Oxford Grove, Devon, with gunshot wounds to his chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. local time, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and authorities say the death toll could rise further.
The area's communications network was also damaged, so there was no news from Donggala Governorate, north of Palut, where the 7.5 magnitude earthquake was centered.
More than 16,000 residents of Palou were evacuated.
Some important facts about Palua and Donggala on Celebes Island:
The capital of the Central Celebes Province, Palu, is built on the western coast of Celebes Island at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a flood.
Donggala Governorate stretches over 300 km along the northwest coast of Celebes Island.
The population of the governorate  administrative region  smaller than the province was approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is predominantly fishing and farming, especially in the Donggala coastal areas.
Nickel mining is an important part of the economy, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit by torrential rains several times in the past 100 years.
A flood in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, West Donggala was hit by a flood, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes are common.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and landslides of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake began off the west coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing a total of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of the deaths occurring in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
On the island of Nias, near Sumatra, hundreds died.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and a subsequent landslide killed nearly 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake devastated near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter volcanic eruption in some areas, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A near-surface earthquake hit Aceh Pidie Jaya governorate, and the resulting panic and destruction reminded many of the terrible 2004 tsunami.
The storm did not form this time, but more than 100 residents were still killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok, a popular tourist island in Indonesia, suffers a powerful earthquake that kills 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were razed, and thousands of tourists were stranded on the island for a time.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, is charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest, according to the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a lady he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention center on a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and, when questioned about his guilt, said, "Not at all".
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
You're also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been in trouble with the law.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged assault to the police.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction of justice, as well as possession of a weapon while under the influence of alcohol in connection with the case.
Her then-girlfriend claimed that the man hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was also criticized by several veterans' organizations in 2016 when she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress from service in Iraq.
Earthquake and landslide in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck on Friday on Celebes Island in Indonesia.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a volcanic eruption that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and telecommunications systems have been rendered inoperative, and the death toll is likely to rise in the coming days.
The epicenter was near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are several videos on social media about the arrival of the spring.
On the shore of Palu, hundreds gathered for a celebration when the waterfall hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the suspect in the New York terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the eight-day New York City terror attack that resulted in the deaths of eight people, the last execution in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged in October with driving a truck rented from Home Depot onto a bicycle path on the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, crashing several pedestrians and cyclists.
To establish the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and "intentionally" injured them, according to a filing with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.
According to the file, the proof of either of these two charges could warrant the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder for extortion purposes, which until then were used almost exclusively against organized crime, and the damage and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack "requires significant planning and premeditated intent", prosecutors say, and Saipov was "consistently, brutally, inhumane" in his words.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the complaint states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York asked for the death penalty for a defendant was a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009 was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Uzbek-born Saipov, according to court documents, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he enjoyed doing what he did.
Saipov said that ISIS videos he watched on his phone gave him the idea for the attack, according to the indictment.
Police say he asked them to put an ISIS drone in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were understandably disappointed by the prosecutors' decision.
"In our opinion, an actual life sentence for confession would have been more favorable, and the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all those involved", says Patton.
Saipov's lawyers have previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for their client.
A Tory MP thinks Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage at a protest at the Tory conference declared that he was calling for a people's army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the pressure from Eurosceptics after a Theresa May party member suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a Conservative who has held no office, told the Birmingham meeting that the UK would have left if Farage had been the Brexit minister.
It's a good indication of the pressure within the party that's been building on May that the Conservative Tories have spoken out at another anti-Brexit rally in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires a constant alignment between the Brexit and Remain parties and the EU.
His allies say he is trying to reach a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, so that the Eurosceptics and Labour can choose between his package or total chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he needed to settle with the Chequers deal.
It suggested that Farage should be elevated to the House of Lords and entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have left by now.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I stand by Brexit but the Chequers deal is a discount".
He criticized the EU, saying: "We did not fight in world wars to be servants to others.
We want to make our own laws.
Bone rejected the assumption that the public mood had changed since the 2016 vote: "There is no real basis for the British people to have changed their minds and want to stay".
Tory Brexit MP Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the meeting and told reporters: "All I ask is that, Madam Prime Minister, you listen to the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote, the party membership is unpopular, and especially among the activists who work in the field and helped us get into government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us.
In a cornerstone message to May, he added: "Only a prime minister can keep his seat who keeps his word".
Farage told the rally that politicians must feel the pressure to not betray the results of the 2016 referendum.
The trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is now at stake.
They want to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't let them.
He addressed the cheering crowd with these words: "I would like our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We call the people's army to fight to win Brexit and we will not rest until we make the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved the banner of the anti-Brexit movement Toryk, which was formed over the weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis has been delighted with the Conservatives' use of the party's security flaws at the opening of the conference.
"These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, for unimpeded border crossing and for a borderless free trade agreement with Ireland", he added.
They're just talking to me.
There is simply no good Brexit.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she's seriously considering running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future Saturday at a civic forum in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign co-chair.
There's been speculation for some time that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office.
A participant asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded by saying it was time for women to take a role in Washington in the repositioning of the declining government, including the highest office.
The person arrested for the shooting of Sims at LSU
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department, at a press conference held at 11 a.m. Eastern time, announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
Earlier, they released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was fatally shot near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the gunshot wound that proved fatal", "Saturday, police captain Murphy J. Paul informed the media, according to a report by 247sports".
Wayde's friend stepped in to protect him, and Simpson was shot.
Simpson admitted to the interrogation that he was at the scene, had a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest was without incident, and the man was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Raised in Baton Rouge, the 6-foot-two Sims played in 32 games last season, 10 as a starter, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world championship after team-mates won the race over Sebastian Vettel
After Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a big role in the race.
Starting from pole position, Bottas started well and almost got Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two laps, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, Vettel stepped out onto the track and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the midfield, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a close action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside bow after making two defensive moves in turn three.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the grid and by the end of the first lap was already seventh.
He then led for most of the race, as he did not change tyres to reach the finish quickly and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in the hopes of fourth place.
He finally made it to the track on lap 44, but failed to improve his pace on the remaining eight laps, leaving Räikkönen in fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri had done a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was ordered to leave.
"The team has done an exceptional job to secure the top two spots", said Hamilton.
She had a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because the senator insisted that she was not the one who leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but merely noted that the events in the Senate prove that people are "disgusting, abhorrent, and liars".
"What can happen, and the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last few days, is when you see the anger, when you see people being angry and mean and hateful and lying", he said.
If you look at the statements and the leaks, you say, "Oh, well, that wasn't me".
That wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak it.
Well, let's stop for a second.
What did we leak? No, we didn't leak.
The letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent by Ford to Feinstein in July, and the letter was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak was the source of his office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, and I did not leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I did, as he requested.
However, his denial seems to have been rejected by the president, who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: "I'll tell you what: your body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women by claiming that the Democrats were using the alleged charges for their own ends.
They're determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They can see the meanness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars and the Belfast Giants
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
With their 5-3 win in the Dundee play-off on Saturday, the Dundee Stars have made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League game.
With Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants had a two-goal lead early on.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game for the home run, after which Dwyer restored the Giants to lead.
Francois Bouchard made up for the loss to Dundee, and then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time the two teams had met this season, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's pass, and then four minutes later, with David Rutherford's help, Beauvillier doubled their lead.
In the rotating opening third, Sullivan brought home the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt's pass equalized Cownie's at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led the way to the break when he scored his second goal late in the first quarter.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard again tied the score with a man-favorite goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's combined play helped Nielsen take the lead for Dundee towards the end of the second third for the first time in the match, then secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the last third.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are headed home to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight controller lost his life to save the hundreds of people on board the earthquake
A traffic controller in Indonesia is being celebrated as a hero for losing his life while making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more were missing after the island of Celebes was hit by a major earthquake on Friday, which triggered a landslide.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many people are trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues' escape, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the shaking control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 which was already on the runway could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
Our hearts were broken when we heard the news.
Authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, and the country's disaster management agency said Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The number of victims is likely to continue to rise as many are trapped under the rubble and many are unreachable", said the organization's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves as high as 20 feet [6.0 m] have devastated Palú, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute, more bodies are being brought in by ambulances.
There's not much clean water.
Small shops were looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country's soldiers to: I ask all of you to work around the clock to carry out evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?
This year, Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing in the lagoon plane crash
An airline operating a plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia has announced the latest news of a missing person, although it has previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini's press release says that as of Sunday afternoon, a male passenger cannot be identified.
The airline says it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further information about the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the plane hit water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
According to the airline and the US Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane missed its runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was flying very low.
"This is a tremendously good thing", Jaynes commented.
Jaynes said he and others were in waist-deep water as the plane was sinking to the emergency exit.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors repairing a nearby dock also helped rescue people and carried them ashore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank 100 feet [30 m] below the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor on Saturday introduced the defendant to a retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in information analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone logs to match the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received several phone records indicating that she was with Tellis Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts the man's previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday, stating that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "lie" because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
According to the cell phone records, they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"You erased him from your life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hiphop trio has called on the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to Bristol's The High Breed, hip-hop has moved away from its roots of dealing with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to those roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is he a black man again?
New York City nan sued for firing a party after a racist message
A New York City nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after a wrongly-sent message from the mother complained that they had hired another black nanny.
The couple denies being racist and liken the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she saw the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, on her first day of work in 2016.
"My wife, I'm going to bed!" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his guilt, Plasco-Flaxman, feeling uncomfortable, fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing grandmother, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was relying on a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation for the dismissal and is seeking $350 a day in compensation for the six-day period of work at the residence he was originally hired to do, although without a contract.
"I want to show them to stop the march, you can't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment because they feared he would be untrustworthy after being offended.
My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone who you were even accidentally rude to?
Your newborn?
Come on, you know what?
Plasco, who likened the lawsuit to blackmail, said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you attack someone like that?
It's not a very nice thing to do, the investment banker said.
While the legal proceedings are underway, the court of public opinion has already quickly condemned the party on social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
According to a letter recently found, the publisher of Paddington was afraid that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to imagine ourselves in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's quite amusing to hear this information now that we know how big a hit Paddington is.
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little toy cat, would not have been upset if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had been a bitter one following his father's death last year.
She called Paddington "a very important member of the family", adding that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was not conceited at all", she said.
But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who takes something, and we're proud of it, even if it's not really our doing.
I think that's how Paddington saw his success.
Though he created it and it was his imagination, he always credited Paddington with the success.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing, she and her daughter were rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"Nad called regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that he was not expected to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly being used up and then left his system.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all over.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the others, who were indifferent to the ordeal she was undergoing.
"No one knew", he said.
I nodded and cried the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.
A picture of mourning women on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from throwing away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting up postcards with inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, and then he committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day.
Ms. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook and that his smile was a source of inspiration.
He knew everyone's smile.
They always said that his smile would blow up anywhere.
However, before his death he gave up his work because he was in very poor condition.
Tyler, who took his own life, was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, "I was constantly worried that this would have some kind of domino effect".
Ms. David designed the postcards to let people know that there are people you can visit and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit quietly. You have to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Ms. Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
She didn't say she was depressed, or anything.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely out of his mind on Christmas Day, when the kids were unpacking their presents, he wouldn't look them in the eye and stuff.
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it, because it left a huge hole in the family.
He tore our hearts to pieces.
But we must continue the fight.

The future of questionable Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could achieve what he asked for, a limited-time, limited-size investigation, maybe we could reach an agreement", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would fall apart because of the party's indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is solely due to timing.
The midterm election is only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans don't perform as expected, it's going to be much harder for them to get their guy on the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby them for the endorsement of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The Senate is in the midst of a vote, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to appoint Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korean dissidents have been declining under Kim
The number of North Korean dissidents entering South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seok cited data from the Southern Unification Ministry and said that there were 1,127 dissidents in the last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for human traffickers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly on this information.
Most North Korean dissidents eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China welcomes dissidents as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, focusing on the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came at the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed broadly on further cooperation on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the Americans, there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances it is inconceivable that we unilaterally disarm", Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and "unfit" for the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his behavior is not appropriate for a Supreme Court justice.
Pelosi said this in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
It occurred to me that if a woman ever did that, I would call her "hysterical" explaining Pelosi's reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has protested emotionally against rumors that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his voice was tingling as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry over the 2016 presidential defeat of Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's behavior proved he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed bias against Democrats.
I think you've been excluding yourself with the statements and the behavior you've been making against the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if he took office and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'm just saying, if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only not fit for the Supreme Court, you're not fit for the court you're in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she considers Kavanugh a conservative judge.
During his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would appeal the Supreme Court's decision.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to sit in the courtroom and expect us to shake with joy", Pelosi said.
And women have to hold it in their hands.
It's a legitimate outburst, a rage that has been building up for months and years, and it's coming out without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's that rare, is it?
"I was helped greatly by a woman who worked in a management position somewhere", she continued. "She told me that she was crying in anger, but she developed a technique where when she started crying in anger, she would say to her interlocutor, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm mad.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, "This is a great idea".
Part of the reason they view tears as a sign of anger is that they have been fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of my early work, in a male-dominated office, is when one day, in my angry helplessness, I started to cry, when an older woman, a cool manager, whom I had always feared, grabbed me by the neck and took me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy they got you upset.
Patricia Schroeder, then-Democrat congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and was disqualified for it, Ms. Schroeder, in her deepest frustration, figured out there was no reason she couldn't run for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they wanted the newest candidate in the middle of their backs.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder was behind on the fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she had the $2 million.
It was a losing battle from the start.
He found out that some of his supporters had given the men $1,000, but he had only received $250.
You think I'm getting a discount?
When he gave a press conference about not launching an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions of gratitude to the people who supported him, and frustration and anger at the system that made it difficult to raise money and reach voters directly, and sexism, that he was thrown off his feet.
"They thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder quoted the press as saying.
They must have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my headstone?
Did you cry?
How is a U.S.-China trade war good for Beijing?
The opening blow of the US-China trade war was almost deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the rift between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warnings earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's most important exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, as the new tariffs already hit $200 billion worth of product, effectively taxing half of all goods from China to the United States.
Beijing has retaliated in all cases, most recently imposing tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. products.
China has vowed to fight back every time, and the world's second largest economy is certain not to back down anytime soon.
If you want to get Washington to back down, that would mean giving up on demands, but publicly bending over to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing is tactically correct, the U.S. trade war pressure could be good for China in the long run, as it reduces the dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could throw either country's economy into a vortex is far more serious than observers have previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, an Asia research assistant at the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to return the refugees voluntarily and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
'The current situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normalcy.
Now, all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who have fled between terrorism and economic measures taken by the authorities, which have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state would welcome any help in rebuilding the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or cooperation from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team by 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six straight on the European stage and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended their title as Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the American star player who struggled throughout the tournament, threw his punch into the water at the par-3 16th hole, handing the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in every round, becoming one of only four players to ever achieve a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5-4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter, who may have been his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the tournament's all-time leading European scorer with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't stop crying today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to have my trophy back.
It's all about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, who struggled with his emotions after winning the European title.
He will give the relay to Jon Rahm, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2 & 1 individual.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's a weird statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the USA team, Jim Fury, the captain of the team, said he was proud of these guys, because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we lit a fire in Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
A great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're reorganizing our team, working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You guys need to raise your hats, too.
The enemy was better than us".
