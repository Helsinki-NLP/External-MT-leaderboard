The concern of the Welsh Assembly Government (AMs) about appearing to be unreasonable
There is some concern among the Councillors of State over the idea of changing the name of their seat to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This idea was born in response to the proposal to rename the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Ministers of State in all political parties are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that  sounded like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means sloth and pwp means idleness.
One Plaid member said that the whole party "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his party "wants to know more about the name change, but this is a shortened version of the change in the language from MWP to nonsense.
In this case the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which drafted the bill to introduce the name change, stated: "The final vote on any nomination of the Members of the National Assembly shall be made by the Members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name of the court.
In April, the Department of Public Works and Transport published a public opinion poll that showed a strong public interest in the Welsh Parliament.
Because of the name of the area, the Association chose the name Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the election of the MWP was largely supported in public opinion polls.
AM is currently seeking additional names, but the challenge of reaching agreement could be a headache for Chair Elin Jones, who is expected to provide legal guidance on the name change in a few weeks.
The proposed amendment will include further changes to the functioning of the court, including rules for the abolition of the AM and the structure of the committee.
The AM will have a final vote on the question of what to call it when discussing the bill.
Macedonians had a free vote on changing the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The election was arranged in an effort to end a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long portrayed its northern neighbor as an attempted secessionist state and has long opposed its EU and NATO membership.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said that he will not support it.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that the name change would cost him his membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent as Harlem churches fight
"According to the old legend, the elders I spoke to said that there was a congregation on every corner", Adams said.
"Today, none of that is available".
He said that the firstborn's mistake was understandable.
"People are now getting into a special kind of addiction", he says.
"We are no longer the traditional resort towns".
But the congregations are concerned that sales will not last as long as the leaders hope, "and that they will soon return to normal".
He added that congregations could be replaced by residential areas where people of all backgrounds could enjoy peaceful living.
"Many of the people who will buy rooms in these buildings will be white", he said, "which will hasten the closing date of the churches because it may not be possible for all who enter these rooms to become members".
All the congregations were established by white religious groups before Harlem became a black Metropolitan Community in 1870 and became St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodists to meet there left in the 1930's.
A group of black people who had gathered nearby took over the hall.
St. Martin's was taken over by a religious congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a protest against the businessmen on 125th Street, Harlem's main thoroughfare, who were prohibiting the use or harvesting of black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building in ruins, but when Father Johnson's students drew up plans for a new building, they produced a carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson who succeeded him at St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's bell".
The carillonneur who played the carillonne in November gave the instruments another name: "The traditional trumpet" and "the instrument of the ages".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also claimed that the first trumpet was played by a black musician in the world, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the main trumpet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's never sought a successor.
The events at St. Martin's during the past few months have been a harrowing tale of architects and builders, some brought in by the congregation, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish board - the vestry - where the congregation's leaders meet - wrote to the diocese in October with concerns that the diocese was "trying to extort salaries" from the vestry, even though the board was not involved in hiring the architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of honesty on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old lobster fisherman in California was injured by a shark
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The accident occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and a group of people rushed to help him out.
Hammel at first thought that it was probably a hobby of his to catch lobster, but then he heard the boy shout, "Nazumi!
I am bored!'
The entire rib cage was removed", Hammel said of the experience when he placed it on the boy.
"I started shouting for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed on the emergency list.
The type of shark that attacked him was not known.
Rescue chief Capt. Larry Giles said in a speech to the nation that the shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it did not appear to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the boy had severe injuries to the upper body of the spine.
Local authorities have closed the access to Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate the incident and to put up a fence.
Giles says that there are up to 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's orders enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's was entering Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a fleet of skincare stores with trained staff.
As part of its entry into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is growing as the apparel and home products industry recovers, the brand will be launched in 11 stores nationwide and will be available in stores from the beginning of the year.
The rise in the cost of cosmetics has come as many stores fill the shelves with TV sets, microwaves, and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it had increased the range of its personal care products to 3,000 brands, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Other established retailers, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees, will also feature in the same display rooms as Boots.
The supermarket is also reopening its boutique business to cater to the growing demand for pet-friendly products.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance will also test its fragrance in a Sainsbury's store, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second is due to open earlier this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the daily shopping of a few thousand people at local stores mean that supermarkets have to work harder to attract customers to shop there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the department store is becoming a bit of a niche market as the supermarket battles Aldi and Lidl for prices on services and nonfood items.
Sainsbury's has already expanded its Argos store into more stores and has been producing Habitat numbers since it bought both stores two years ago, which it says has boosted sales and added value.
The store's previous attempt to recover fragments of the fuel and the medicines failed.
Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots in the early 2000's, but the problem arose after a dispute over the price of the store's wooden shelves.
The new arrangement comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281st pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
Lloyds, he said, could play a major role in this process, adding other skin care products to the range, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
"We have changed the look and feel of the skincare stores to add a touch of beauty to our customers", says Paul Mills- Hicks, a sales representative at Sainsbury's.
We have also arranged for the training of regular staff and for counseling.
Our range of products is designed to accommodate all needs and the attractive and ubiquitous landscape means that we are now at the forefront of a market that is more inclusive than ever before".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby walks out of £11m deal
Dragons Den bandleader Peter Jones is 'outraged' after media mogul Holly Willoughby walked away from £11million lifestyle business to focus on new business partnerships with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had little time to work on Truly furniture and other appliances.
The two's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop products.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning took to Instagram to announce that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby's departure from Dragons" Den has angered Peter Jones because Holly has left the luxury goods business - which was a lucrative one for a short time - to focus on new business partnerships with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The reporter said Jones was "extremely upset" when a TV celebrity admitted at a press conference on Tuesday at their headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business - worth £1.5 million - meant she no longer had time to focus on her Truly furniture and appliance business.
The business has been compared to Goop's property of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to grow to double Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain for a holiday home.
"Truly", says the announcer, "this is one of Holly's greatest passions.
It was to be his profitable business venture that would carry him forward for years to come.
His choice of outcome amazes all involved.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday, so close to the opening of the market.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow HQ waiting to be sold".
The crowd was concerned that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's richest people, would affect the store's operations, which deal with a range of products including clothing and accessories, as well as the delay in opening.
It could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been married to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined in March.
The two partners and Jones own 40 percent of Baldwin's television business.
Willoughby will be the new marketing representative for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity.
"We have nothing to say about this business arrangement", said a speaker close to Jones last night.
Strong words and then love
He joked about the criticism he might have made in the news about saying some things that some might say are "un-presidential" and being very supportive of the North Korean leader.
What was the cause of President Trump's removal?
Trump said in his speech that the "media is the media".
"I didn't say anything".
He knew that Kim was eager to meet again after the first summit in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the talks on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore talks, North Korean official Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not seen a "reasonable response" from the U.S. to the rapid dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
They felt that the U.S. was imposing sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump, in his speech, took it easy and hoped that everything would be fine.
He said, "We're working very well with North Korea",
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of lives could have been lost.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
He said that his efforts to reconcile with Kim had brought good results - ending rocket tests, helping to rescue captives, and bringing back the bodies of soldiers.
He defended his unique speech by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who need to get into this crowded space, we could have 200 people standing there", Trump said, referring to his supporters.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes devastate the island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was left homeless, the country did not declare a national emergency, which would have forced the withdrawal of international aid.
"Many times, unfortunately, it was made clear that they didn't need any help, so it was impossible", Ms. Sumbung said.
At the time Save Children was planning a trip to Palu, it was not clear whether international workers would be able to work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster management agency, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the extent of the disaster in Palu and whether foreign organizations could be allowed to join the relief effort.
In view of Indonesia's frequent landslides, the country is in grave danger of being ill-equipped to survive the natural disaster.
While offshore wind farms have been built in Aceh, other coastal areas are not.
The lack of a warning system in the area, even though it was in place, was a major factor in the death toll.
Travel between many of Indonesia's islands has often been difficult.
Natural disasters also contribute to morals.
The Lombok medical center is on its way to Palu, but it may take up to three days to reach the new emergency area.
President Joko Widodo has focused on repairing Indonesia's damaged infrastructure and roads as a way to win voters over, and has also invested heavily in roads and railways.
But now the money is being withdrawn from Joko's administration as he approaches re-election this year.
Joko had another problem with religious practices in Indonesia, where many Muslims have become involved in a system of self-serving worship.
Over a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands left homeless as Christian and Islamic groups fought in the streets, using swords, arrows, spears, and other heavy weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a 30-yard field goal from Xherdan Shaqiri as Chelsea led 1-0.
He returned the ball to his left before he hit the nearest goal.
The fish went far and eventually fell to the right side of the net.
A ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga's head and he was forced to enter the island.
"You just want to get in there, be on the payroll and players like Shaq always struggle to play forward, so I was struggling to make up for lost time", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming to meet me but I ignored him and I just hit him".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian Eden Hazard.
The Blue's goalkeeper hit the ball to Matthew Kovacic in the middle of the field, before he went around the middle of the field and ran to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic came up with the pass and went into the middle of the field.
Then he hit a pitch, sending Hazard into the corner.
Hazard rushed past the goalkeepers and took the lead on the left-hand side of the pitch over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage match at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will also face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesian death toll from tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami and earthquake has now reached 832, the disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Several people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings as a result of Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake that raised waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters.
Palu, with a population of 380,000, was filled with rubble cut from crumbling buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man who is suspected of killing a woman who was stabbed to death.
An investigation is under way after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with the death.
The police asked people in the area who had seen or heard anything to come forward.

I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have something on their car cameras, to contact us because they may have information that will help our investigation.'
Police spokesmen confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that her body was found in the building.
In the late afternoon, friends who knew the woman went to the scene to ask questions about the whereabouts of the body that morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police say they plan to inform the woman's family.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to enter his room but was stopped by the police because no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
You are shocked to learn what happened.
Residents in the area are now being told that it may take a few hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A policeman was overheard telling a man that the entire area was now being investigated as a crime scene.

The statue of Cromwell Palace becomes a modern monument to 'historical research'
Its ban would be a poetic retribution for his Taliban-like destruction of many aspects of English culture and religion by his Puritan subjects.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's speech as "crazy" and "a historical exercise".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was clear in the debate over the statue that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster might be one of the subjects of the examination.
The planning of the colonial wars did not begin with Cromwell.
Still, Cromwell may have played a role in the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier.
Cromwell's most complete description of Sir William Hamlet Thorneycroft is a confirmation of the 19th century's view and historical record of a man who might be considered worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen more, especially in the late 19th century than today, as the protector of parliament from outside threats, in his view of what would be a one-man government.
If this is the perfect representation of it, it could be a subject of ongoing discussion in secular mythology.
The fact is that the revolutions of the mid-17th century shaped the next generation of our country, and Cromwell is a notable figure who represents one side of this divide.
His heroic deeds as King's Guard are also worthy of praise and honor".
A Chinese Farmer Is Licked to Death by a Wild Pig
A farmer was attacked and killed by a boar in a rural market in northern China, according to local media.
The man, known only by his middle name "Yuan", was found dead with a bloody heart attack near a pig farm in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inoculate his pigs on a grass field on April 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was told that he had taken his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 of his pigs at the market.
The next morning, her nephew found her dead, and the door to the next barn was open.
He said that in the same room was a large pig with a blood stain.
An autopsy revealed that the same 550-pound pig had bitten and killed the farmer, according to the route prescribed.
"My nephew's legs were bloodied and broken", said his cousin, "Wu", according to the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the pig was selected to prevent anyone from attacking him during a police investigation.
The Yuan dynasty and the market officials discussed the matter of honesty at their death.
Although rare, pig attacks on humans have occurred in recent times.
In 2016, a couple in Massachusetts were attacked by a pig on their farm, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig chased a Welsh farmer by his tractor until his wife drove him away and killed him.
After an Oregon farmer was infected with his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not a problem, but the smell of blood can be a "problem"
"Pigs are generally happy.
They have no youthful intelligence, no research.... and no violence.
But he deserves the honor that is due him".
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rain to the western US
According to meteorologists, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it makes its way to the northern tip of Mexico.
However, Rosa is expected to bring heavy rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had sustained 85 mph, Category 1 hurricane-force winds, as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was moving 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At this point, clouds begin to rise over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward near the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to move cooler northerly winds toward the U.S. west coast.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the moist winds combined with the clouds will bring heavy rainfall to the near west in the coming days.
In this area, between 1 and 4 inches of rain will cause thunderstorms, hail, and possibly desert landslides.
The heavy rainfall in the area will bring up to two to three inches of rain, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 2 and 4 inches of rain are expected in much of the northern part of the state, especially in the Arizona metropolitan area.
Floods can occur in a series of weather events caused by heavy rainfall.
It would be a terrible mistake to walk through the desert in the face of such a threat.
Heavy rains can turn valleys and mountain streams into torrential rivers and strong winds can produce heavy rains and heavy dust.
The approaching clouds will bring rain to the peninsula regions of Southern California.
A total of up to one-half inch of precipitation may occur, which can lead to debris and road debris.
This may be the first of their rains.
The heavy snowfall will begin to move into Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before the heavy snowfall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will be expected on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
The U.S. summer season is hotter than the Arctic, but the tropics are warmer.
Sometimes this results in a slight change in temperature.
An example of a temperature difference is seen in the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of up to 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the days that follow, the summer heat will begin to build up and increase again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience high temperatures of up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80°C] from the South to the East.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is 10 degrees above normal.
Long-term weather forecasts suggest that extreme temperatures may be expected in the eastern U.S. during the first half of the spring.
Over 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the six-part, nationwide broadcast of the true-life testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and of a woman named Christine Blasey Ford, who allegedly tried to rape her in the early 1980's.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, as the media scrambles their schedules to air this Friday's news flash: the succession of Arozona Sen. Jeff Flake's representatives at the FBI have been ordered to delay a week's investigation.
Mrs. Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh was caught drunk and tried to strip him during a school funeral.
Kavanaugh, in his honest testimony, also said that he was 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
It is estimated that over 20.4 million people watched the trial on Friday, according to the streets provided by Nilesen
The company counted the ratings of the cases on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership figures were not immediately available from other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen sometimes has trouble accurately counting the number of people who visit their offices.
Put simply, this number can be compared to the number of people watching a football game in a stadium or attending an Academy Awards ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose broadcasts were heavily supportive of Kavanaugh's appointment, had a low audience of 5.69 million over the entire period of the hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The matter was left to the discretion of the court.
Flake was the focus of Friday's talk.
After a Republican official announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning being shouted at by an angry crowd as he climbed the ladder to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
She stood up in shame as she was told about the CNN broadcast.
"I'm standing here before you", said one woman.
"Do you think he speaks the truth to the world?
"You are strong where most women are weak", they said.
Mr. Flake said that his office had already informed him about the case, before the court closed, that he had more to say to the board after the hearing.
All the major news outlets covered the events until hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to move Kavanaugh to the Senate primary.
But Flake said he was doing so on the understanding that the FBI would look into the suspect's election next week, something that a minority of Democrats would deny.
Flake was convinced seven times through his interview with fellow Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election is significant because it means that Republicans cannot get a majority of the vote for Kavanaugh without a referendum.
President Trump has rejected the FBI investigation into all of the Kavanaugh cases.
British Prime Minister May suspects her critics of 'politically manipulating' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politically manipulating" Britain's economic goals, she told the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another discussion that came close to the front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched an attack on May's so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the idea that Britain and the EU should be taxed more "is completely untrue".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspect in connection with LSU coach's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the rape and murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said
The police chief showed a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and also said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on the glass, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he admitted to having severely beaten Sims.
His bail was set at $350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office released preliminary results on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and the local community for their assistance in the arrest.
LSU team president Joe Alleva commended the local legislature for its "efforts and commitment to justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
The guy averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply saddened" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you always worry about", Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it was found that the eruption had increased its volcanic activity by 183 volts in 24 hours.
The area was experiencing frequent thunderstorms and earthquakes.
Some photographs showed cars with ash on the windows in some parts of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have reported an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) northwest of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
Known as "Don Goyo", the volcano first erupted in 1994.
Police clash with Catalan protesters just before the commemoration of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after supporters of the independence movement clashed with police, while several took part in a protest by protesters at the start of the celebration of the Catalan secession vote.
A mob of masked men with facial wrinkles protected by police were being whipped with powdered paint, creating a cloud of dust in the streets where tourists were supposed to be found.
The riot broke out at some point during the day and police used their batons to break up the riot.
For the next few hours, the independence movement chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" while the Unionists chanted "Keep Spain".
Fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries in the blasts, local media reported.
The scene is a nightmare in the centre of the independence movement, a year after the referendum on 1 May, which was declared illegal in Madrid but celebrated by the new Catalan revolution.
Most voters voted for independence, although only a small minority of non-separatists did not vote.
According to Catalan officials, up to 1,000 people were injured this year after police attempted to block the elections in a busy area.
Freedom groups camped outside on Friday to protest in support of the national police.
The protests continued but were forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said that he had lost all hope of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was a very peaceful time for us.
I saw my parents cry tears of joy at the opportunity to make a choice and now we are being forced", she said.
Despite a landslide victory in the December elections, Catalan independence activists are fighting hard to regain power this year as some of their powerful leaders remain in hiding and others in prison awaiting punishment for their role in the preparation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests on her cell phone, said that the protests were supported by politicians on both sides.
"This is a strange saying", they said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine prominent Catalan leaders who was imprisoned without trial last year, announced that he would stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
"European elections are the best way to fight against the regression of the dictatorship and dictatorship that has characterized Spain", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crash
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car struck a house several times in Londonderry.
The accident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the doorway and the house itself.
It seems that the arrow was in the car for a while.
A bloody scratch in the back of the net gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought her victory
The Livingston team was beaten by Rangers manager Steven Gerrard in a double defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's character made a difference when Gary Holt's team joined the Hibernia in the second episode.
Gerrard's side remained unbeaten in the Premiership for the remainder of the season as they faced Hearts, who were eight points clear at the top, on Sunday.
In the meantime, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continues its six-game winning streak under the undefeated head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's team lost the chance to win by taking on stronger teams
Holt's team had to be in the lead with no goals, and their tenacity would make the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson was halfway through but came off the bench to catch the ball, while Alan Lithgow put in his best effort after a slide and head-to-head with Craig Halkett who hit the opposing goalpost.
The owners are very confident in letting the Ranger play in front of them, hoping to beat the visitors in the shorter periods.
That is how the problem was solved.
Rangers came up with the goal line and Livingston worked to clear the field, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to prepare Menga, who caught the ball and hit it out of the middle of the box.
This time, the Rangers took the ball but found the full-back strong and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was well prepared,
This play continued into the second episode, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on a pay raise from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied a game by Rangers defender Allan McGregor and Lithgow came up short of a second-half loan deal made by Livingston.
The penalty shootout continued into the Livingston area but was all repeated, and two points - after Halkett's fight at the bench against Glenn Middleton, and one catch - were denied.
'Surprise' for the Livingston team - a review from
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A surprise game and a surprise victory for Livingston.
For each one, he has tested himself well, going beyond what was expected in this high exaltation.
Their style has not changed since their return to the top, but the praise goes to Holt in the way he has been preparing the crowd since he joined the group.
He has many good players.
Captain Halkett worked hard, arranging for a paycheck, and Menga had Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the sidelines for the duration of the paycheck.
The Rangers are still out of the wind.
Although they have had occasional successes under Gerrard, they have not been able to live up to those standards.
Their last game was a draw - they only had one substitute - and they must have been impressed by Rangers, who were now in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a warm welcome in Cologne
There were smiles and happy smiles on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of a difficult visit by President Erdogan of Germany - one aimed at improving relations between NATO members.
They have withdrawn on a number of grounds including human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a large mosque.
It is the largest Turkish city outside Turkey.
Police said that security measures prevented crowds of up to 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque but that many of the emperor's supporters stood at a distance to see their leader.
Many Erdogan critics - including Kurds - have also spoken out, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him.
This public outcry created a divide between welcoming a visitor who was welcomed by the German Turks and being denounced by others as a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle rider killed after being hit by car
A cyclist died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, on the east side of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics tried to help, but the man died instantly.
The accident came just months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that authorities were investigating the identity of the man so that they could contact his family.
Road closures and lane changes are underway and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six soldiers injured in riot
Prison soldiers were injured in the riot in the main prison for men, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The Tornado infantry were called in to respond to the riot, which involved eight inmates and was confined to one side of the prison.
Soldiers are being treated for minor facial injuries right there in the prison.
A spokesman for the Military Prison Service said: "Specialised personnel were sent to check on the situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six soldiers were wounded.
We do not tolerate riots in our prisons, and those involved in such violations will be taken to the police and may be sentenced to additional years in prison.
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most notorious criminals.
In the month of April it was reported that the warden was being treated in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in the spring of this year, the police were called in to stop the bad raids where workers were attacked by throwing pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and flooded areas
It is unlikely that tropical storm force winds will reach Arizona, but that is likely to happen next week as the remaining force of Rosa moves through the Desert Southwest, where it carries a torrent of rain.
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to northeastern Nevada, central California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass through Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain expected through Monday.
The Phoenix section of the National Weather Service reported on Twitter that 10 tropical cyclones with winds of up to 200 miles per hour have struck Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border".
The National Hurricane Center's final forecasts are for 2 and 4 inches of rain, and in some areas up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the area between the Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with some areas reaching as much as 4 inches.
For those outside the flood risk zone, the Rosa rains can be a blessing because the area is prone to drought.
While the weather is a serious concern, some of these showers will be a blessing in some areas because the midwest and southwest are currently in a dry climate.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a severe drought, the second worst on record", reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa is heading southward toward the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is moving 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The ice is being forced back by the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean.
Therefore, heavy rainfall and tropical storm force are expected in Mexico during the afternoon and evening of Monday.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall can be very heavy, causing a temperature problem.
"A total of between 3 and 6 inches of precipitation is expected from Baja California to eastern Sonora, up to 10 inches at times", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, passing through Arizona and entering southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat to either Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to bring devastating floods and landslides in the desert, and landslides in the wetlands.
Midsomer Norton accident: Four arrested for attempted murder
Two teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST on Sunday.
He is taken to the hospital where he is now in a coma.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The police have asked anyone with a recording of the incident to come forward.
Trump called Kavanaugh "a bully, a bully, and a bully" of the Democratic Party
"The Kavanaugh vote is a vote against the violence and the mismanagement of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has been the target, the target, the target of the Democratic Party throughout his election campaign.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcing him to disprove Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she was sexually abused as a child.
Ford has also testified at the trial on his own behalf.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the strength, intelligence, and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm a man of our time, a judge known for his goodwill toward the public", a group of supporters in West Virginia were told.
The President referred to Kavanaugh's election as a reference to the Republican majority in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks remain until the great riches of our time are chosen.
I am not standing for a vote, but for the truth".
"That's why I've been in so many places supporting the powerful".
Trump said that the Democrats are on a dangerous mission "to divide and conquer".
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held before Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by the earthquake, the tsunami in Indonesia, and the death toll was still rising.
At least 384 people were killed or washed away in waves as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate on the beach in the coastal city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six feet (18 m) high came ashore late in the evening, taking many people with them and destroying everything in their path.
The waves followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the wave alarm was heard yesterday, people were doing their jobs in the sea and they were not able to escape immediately and were attacked", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for BNPB's disaster response agency in Indonesia, told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami waves didn't just hit, they took away cars, logs, houses, and everything that was found on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the waves were traveling at 800 kph (497 mph) before they reached land.
Others jumped from the trees and escaped the waves.
Up to 16,700 people were evacuated and taken to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerial photographs taken by the disaster unit showed that many buildings and shops had collapsed, floors were crumbling and the mosque was surrounded by water.
Small quakes followed us through the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the force of Friday's quake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
They said that the building of this city, which is located on the tip of the island, caused the waves to rise.
Nugroho described the destruction as "massive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, bars, and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of people were found buried in the rocks covered by the collapsed tombs, and another 540 people were reported injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage could increase in the coastal area about 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, near the epicentre.
The conversation was all mixed up with no news from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were on their way to the disaster areas.
"This is a terrible disaster, and it could get worse, they said.
The agency was busy on Saturday with no tsunami warning for Palu, even though officials said the waves arrived on time before the warning was given.
One video posted on social media featured a man shouting from a building to warn people on the street below of the coming tsunami.
Within minutes a floodwaters came ashore and washed away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video at the time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and disrupted communications around Palu, rendering rescue operations impossible.
Military planes have been sending supplies and relief from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still need food and other essential items.
The city's airport is open for humanitarian purposes and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu Survivors' Center on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Donggala has made it safely to Palu, where they are sitting in the tarpaulin sheets of their office yard, they are walking through a devastating area, says Doseba.
"I was told that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It is a terrible thing.
Although relief groups seemed to be getting ready to provide relief, some complained that highly qualified relief workers from abroad were being prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funds, goods, and personnel can only be brought into the area after it has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a provincial crisis", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'OK, this is a global disaster,' we can call for help from other countries, but that is not yet the case".
As the second day of the earthquake and tsunami struck Palu on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing still have hope that their loved ones can be like a miraculous healing force in the aftermath of this terrible disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy is thrown into a toilet.
On Sunday, rescuers found a woman who had been buried under rocks buried for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has coached two of the missing athletes at the Asian Games, which ended last month in Indonesia.
Some of those detained at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students
"I am a paragliding coach, and I carry a heavy load on my shoulders", he said.
Gendon explained how the municipality, after hearing about the Roa Roa Hotel collapse and the news spreading among the participants, started sending WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were taking part in the riverside celebration.
Sadly, their message was a blurred, unadorned blue.
"I think this means that the promise has not been fulfilled, as they said.
A robber withdrew $26,750 from an ATM at Newport Levee
The robbers on Friday stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was depositing cash at an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a traffic report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was pouring money out of the gym's ATM and preparing to take more, wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in the report.
While he was being chased away, another man "came running from behind Brink's servant" and stole a bag of money from the distribution.
Witnesses reported seeing suspects leaving the scene, according to the street, but police could not say exactly how many people were involved.
Anyone who can obtain a copy of the report can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The singer changes his name to Ye
Singer Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
In a Twitter post on Saturday, he wrote: "Kanye West is a legend".
West, 41, was given the nickname Ye at one point by using it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The name change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to open her new album Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled due to "some ideas" expressed by the producers.
As well as the abbreviation of his name used in his current work, West has in the past said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I believe ye is the most common word in the Bible, and the Bible means iwe", West said in a discussion of his new album earlier this year with Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It comes from the One, who is the only One, who reveals our goodness, our badness, our shame, all of it.
This envelope tells us a lot about who we are".
He is one of the most famous singers to change their names.
Sean Combs is better known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Another of West's frequent collaborators, JAY-Z, sometimes removes his name tag and writes his name in lower case.
Mexican president AMLO promises to stop military action against civilians
New Mexican president Andre Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never again to use military force against the population as the nation approaches the 50th anniversary of the student bloodbath.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never again use the military to harass Mexican citizens.
The military broke up peaceful protesters in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people as student groups were forming in America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexico's youth by increasing student fees and opening more universities.
He attributed unemployment and lack of educational opportunities to the youths' involvement in gangs.
The U.S. should increase its A.I. funding.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should increase its investment in research, said entrepreneur and AI founder Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come as many U.S. government departments are making AI announcements, even though the U.S. does not appear to have a comprehensive AI program.
At the same time, China launched its own strategy this year: it aims to become the number one AI market by 2030.
Increasing funding for AI research would be a good start, especially at a time when many countries are lagging behind the U.S., and we are looking at further AI efficiency", Lee said.
Increased funding could increase the chances of the next successful AI operation in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested $1.3 billion in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the early 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that mimicked the American genius Othello, and later he joined Microsoft Research and was a Google executive in China.
Lee referred to past U.S. technology projects such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked what the next step would be, as it might involve identifying people with expertise in the field.
Researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to win federal funding, says Lee.
"China is not taking academic leaders; it is taking institutions", said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have over the years attracted a large number of university graduates to work on AI.
Lee said that changing traffic laws could also help the U.S. to improve its AI-enabled services.
"I think that green cards should be given only to those with PhDs in AI", he said.
The State Council of China will announce the national Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in June 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation in China provides funding for research centers in much the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding for U.S. researchers, but the impact of such research is less in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department opened the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which brings together professionals from the private and academic sectors, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DAPRA announced $2 billion in funding for a project called AI Next.
But on the NSF side, it currently invests up to $100 million a year in AI research.
On the other hand, the U.S. bill to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seemed to work in recent months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would end a decades-long dispute with Greece that has also hampered their bid for European Union and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says that the name of the northwestern neighbor represents a part of its territory and opposes its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two countries reached an agreement in June on the new name, but nationalist opponents of the government said that the name change would confuse the identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjoege Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and that the vote-counting ban will cast doubt on whether the voter turnout will reach the 50% threshold required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper read: "Do you want membership in NATO and the EU and the consent of Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was worth the price of EU and NATO membership for Macedonia, a breakaway country from Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for a national goal, for the youth of Macedonia to live in freedom under the European Union because it means a better life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not all, many lawmakers said they would accept the results of the election to ensure a fair election.
A change of name requires a vote of more than three times the number of members of the legislature.
The national election commission said there were no problems in the polls at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters participated.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on a name change that would pave the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a platform and setting up a bench in front of tents erected by the nonparticipants.
"We want to be in NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads open, not in ignorance", said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor but rich country.
If they don't want to make us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian alliance".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed progress to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I hope that we will have a lot of support because up to 80 percent of our people are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
They said that a "yes" vote would be a confirmation of our cause".
A poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia suggested that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a much lower number than required.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV, a Macedonian television station, found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
A referendum requires at least 50 percent of the votes cast and one vote cast.
The failure to pass the referendum would represent the biggest challenge to the constitutional legitimacy of the Eastern bloc since it came to power in May this year.
Next: Manchester City goalkeeper Sergio Aguero crosses the goal line at Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were the defending champions after Brighton beat Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
An Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran and scored through two defenders in the Brighton side before falling into the open.
At this point Aguero was found surrounded by four-legged clothing.
He passed one guard before running to leave the others at the end of the Brigthton box.
He turned left, and found Sterling.
The Western forward used the forward's possession in the box to return the ball to Aguero who used his right foot to beat the Brighton goalkeeper and put the ball to the right of the net.
"Aguero is fighting a problem in his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told the media.
"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
And that is exactly what happened.
Fortunately, she was able to get the baby in at that time".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first Premier League game.
The score came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball inside the Brighton area in that game.
He sent a good ball to Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane nodded a few times and led Sterling to the end of the room.
The future Sky Blues forward threw a net ball just before he left the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wanted to play against the Rockies.
When the Nationals were finally removed from the bitter rivalry, there was no reason to start over.
But all-time champion Scherzer is hoping to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the restrictions of the draft allow the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, to win.
The Rockies are in the midst of a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night and are looking to work their way to the top of the division.
"Even if we play with nothing, we can walk away with the pride of knowing that the look here in Denver and the crowd and the other teams will be playing at the highest level I'll ever reach this year.
Why can't I win this game?"
The Nationals have not yet announced their start on Sunday, but they are reportedly looking to let Scherzer pick the stadium for this season.
Scherzer, who is making his 34th start, will select the bench on Thursday and will select the field on Sunday during the regular season break.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The President was referring to a speech by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in which he spoke of the Republican surge in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done can be disrupted in November.
Five weeks remained before the day of our great trial.
This is a great, great thing - not that I am elected but that I am elected. For this reason I am everywhere opposed to those who are elected, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this bad group, the bad Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
They also desire to have power for themselves in every way, with violence, contempt,
They do not care for the wounded, who are trampled on to dominate and rule, and they want power and justice, and we will not give them".
Trump said that Democrats are on a difficult mission "to counterbalance it".
"You can see what has happened in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and violent, contemptuous and lying".
He also referred to a Senate Judiciary Committee statement naming Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, which caused a stir in the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you distribute the tract without permission?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for something - that was the worst body language - the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour no longer the largest party
It does not tolerate those who speak truths from their own thoughts
When the Momentum supporters in my party voted to nominate me, I was not surprised.
Yet, I am one of the great leaders of the industry who have been told they are not welcome - just for expressing our views.
A friend of mine, lawyer Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she refused to participate in prostitution.
For my part, the reason for my appointment was my refusal to endorse Jeremy Corbyn.
On the richness of practical economic law, on national security, the same issues Jeremy refused to share with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we want a full and progressive meeting.
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been almost always the same.
Unfortunately today, not many conferences and promises of a moderate, moderate political system have been fulfilled or, in fact, begun.
It is now clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that views are always decided on whether they are accepted or rejected by party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took office, when colleagues who had similar views with me in the past expected me to quickly change my beliefs into beliefs I had never thought possible - whether it was national security or a single EU citizen.
Every time I speak out - and I don't care what I say - there's a lot of hard-hitting words about the people saying I should be removed, about the centrists, about me not being a Labour member.
I do not do these things on my own.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow ministers because the word spoken about me seems to be a political word.
I marvel at the hard work and perseverance of my fellow workers, who endure day after day in the midst of the scourge of death and do not give up.
A sad fact about politics today is that oppression seems to be justified.
Jeremy Corbyn this week said the Labour Party should have the right to take everything.
The fact is that we are no longer as large as we once were and that every time there are laws of "unreliability" the church is getting smaller.
I have received countless counsel in the past two years to bow my head, to say nothing, and then "it's all right".
But that was not the way I got involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student to protest the negligence of the Thatcher government that nearly brought down my school, I have been determined to work hard and provide the good things for the citizens who need them - whether as a chancellor or as a head of a political party.
I have not withheld my political representation, even in my last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused by my verses and some of the things I disagree with about the current administration.
To those who supported this on Friday, all I can say is that as the world moves towards a Brexit that will disrupt many of our lives, businesses and services to the people, I cannot understand this waste of time and energy on my commitment to Labour leadership.
But the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituency, whether Labour or not: I am committed to serving you and I promise that no threat or harsh political words will deter me from doing what I believe is right.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr tops
A two-Test delay would have disrupted the final, but Ayr was undoubtedly in line to win the best game of the night in the Tennent Premiership.
Now there is a heavenly host that has not been subjected to them.
In the end it was their defensive side that beat him, as well as taking advantage of their chances, which led to their victory and their coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have been tested in our race until now, and we have not been defeated, sister, I should be happy", he said.
For example, Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "The credit goes to Ayr, who has done a better job of his chances than we have".
A 14th-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, played by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was allowed by the Warriors to score, gave Melrose the score and Jason Baggot took the unanswered goal to score.
Climo added to Ayr's performance by scoring a penalty, then, at half-time, he scored and then humiliated himself by scoring a solitary goal to take a 17-5 lead over Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose had a good start to the second half when Patrick Anderson hit, and Baggot scored, narrowing the gap to five.
There was a long wait due to injury for Ruaridh Knott, who was ruled out, and when he started again, Ayr went forward through a penalty that hit Stafford McDowall, and was relegated to the Climo.
Ayr's captain's replacement, Blair Macpherson, was this time out for a draw, Melrose was on the scoresheet but a Bruce Colvine goal was missed, ending a hard-fought battle
The owners came out strong, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a free throw for a scoreless Climo, from the penalty area, MacPherson came out with the ball down behind Ayr who was following him.
He scored again, as he had done many times since the start, after Kyle Rowe came to catch the ball that hit David Armstrong in the box and knocked out catcher Gregor Henry on the fifth pitch.
A still game player seems poised to launch a new culinary business
Still Game actor Ford Kieran seemed eager to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he had been chosen as the company's CEO.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a BBC documentary, which he writes and stars in with his longtime friend Greg Hemphill.
The two men stated that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's last, and it seemed that Kiernan was preparing for his life after Craiglang.
According to the executive schedule, he is the president of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although the Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan was seeking to enter the Glasgow restaurant business".
'Our ocean': Bolivia, surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, hopes the court will open a road to the Pacific
Pirates passed through the main port of La Paz.
The buildings of the country are decorated with blue flags.
The port from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is marked with the words: "Our sea is ours.
It is our responsibility to find him".
Across Bolivia, the memory of the coastal lands that Chile captured in the bloody 19th century is still being remembered - just as the desire to plunder the Pacific Ocean is still needed.
This hope has been growing in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a strong, united and tolerant spirit, and a lot of optimism", said Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian ambassador.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on the country's major cities, hoping that the regional court in The Hague will grant Bolivia's request that - after decades - Chile agree to negotiations to give Bolivia access to the Sea.
Bolivia's religious president Evo Morales - who is fighting for reelection this year - has strong support in Monday's ruling.
"We are almost back in the Pacific Ocean", they vowed in late October.
Some historians, however, say that no other court can judge the good of Bolivia - and that little will change if it does.
The UN in the Netherlands has no authority to grant Chile a seat, and I will not be the deciding party in any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's ruling comes shortly after the final hearing showed that the case was not a success, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean geologist.
And on the Bolivian side, the last four years have seemed to be backwards.
"The issue of access to the sea is a matter of the current administration in Bolivia", says Zárate.
The dictator Morales has taken away all that Chile had, they say.
Bolivia and Chile may occasionally talk, but it will be very difficult to continue the conversation after that.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, rejects the idea that the court's decision was often premature.
The day before Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to open a new era of cooperation with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of economic discord", they said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - used the sea-front as a platform for political propaganda.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The judicial process can be a much-needed opportunity to get over the past".
North Korea says denuclearization will only happen if it trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country would never denuclearize without first trusting Washington.
Ri made the remarks on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He has called on the United States to honor the commitments it made at the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
Their comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to launch a major nuclear talks three months after the Singaporean talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri called it an "unrealistic dream" that continued U.S. sanctions and a delayed end to the Korean War would cause the North to swell.
Washington is concerned about the approval of the first Pyongyang-based dismantling talks.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted a second summit.
But there is a question as to whether Pyongyang would be willing to compromise on what it sees as its only defense.
Pompeo was planning to visit Pyongyang for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
A Paris fashion show features a new line of high-end clothing being brought to the High Street near you
If you need to add more shade to your helmets or sunscreens, stay close.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled the stylish hats in the SS19 roadside collection that dominated the Paris Fashion Week.
The beautiful hats that are on Instagram this summer are also being sent to every corner and street.
Valentino's most beautiful crown was a large, bright blue one with a hairlike tip that covered the head of the garment.
Some of the larger ones included a water-filled cap, a magic crown, and a statue - but these were not designed to provide warmth to the head.
Thom Browne also reveals his facial wrinkles - just before Halloween.
Many eyeglasses had a wide-brimmed lip and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One was designed to resemble scuba diving gear with a tube and glasses, and the other was designed to resemble a frozen ice cream cone.
Blessed is the one who keeps the word of the trade in his cloak.
According to the researchers, the giant wreaths are now moving to the roads near you.
Large hats are a nice addition to 'La Bomba' shoes, a two-pointed grass hat seen on many heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Another popular item was a crown that circled the body and made a distinctive emblem - a straw sack that was shaped like a crown, similar to the wearer.
The orange-red raiffia hat, the ribbon and the red leather necklace were featured prominently in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see the big hats and the ladies' hats on the highway next summer - when the designer is so popular that it will be hard to break the chain of big bags.'
John Edward: Language skills are a rich source of income for people around the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue to perform well academically, and this is followed in 2018 by another strong performance, which is encouraged by individual and team involvement in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
As the number of students in Scotland grew to 30,000, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), struggled to provide quality education and services for students and parents.
Schools that serve are designed to prepare students for higher education, careers, and a place in the world.
As a field of study that can create and fulfill a complete curriculum, we see the rise of new languages as subjects in our schools.
"When you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes to his head", said Nelson Mandela.
If I speak to him in his own language, it is to his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the list of top marks in private schools.
Up to 68 percent of the foreign-language students were successful in reaching the Upper Class.
The report, drawn from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved the Top A Grade in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that the Scottish schools are supporting foreign languages as a future resource for children and young people.
Languages are now, as an elective, considered in the same way as science or STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curriculum in private and non-public schools.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons employers are being pressured to fill positions are due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, a greater knowledge of languages is essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
At a time when many jobs require linguistic skills, this skill is rife in a collaborative world.
No matter what job one chooses, learning a second language will open the door to a permanent position.
Being able to communicate with native speakers of other languages will give a person who knows many languages an advantage over others.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 UK adults, up to 75% of people did not speak the country's foreign language to communicate effectively with others, with French being the second most common language spoken by a further 15%.
This is why it is now profitable to invest in language education for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing lands, will help children to have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will have a different language.
Some schools will focus on new languages, while others will teach languages that are expected to be the UK's most popular languages in the years ahead, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, there will be a wide variety of languages to choose from in specialized schools, with trained teachers.
The Scottish Independent Schools are committed to creating an educational environment that equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future may hold.
It is undeniable today, in a globalized world, that nations have become increasingly wealthy for national purposes, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "a global communication tool".
Independent schools will continue to provide this wealth, diversity and education to Scotland's youth.
We should work hard.
John Edward is the Regional Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the exact minutes of the meeting have not yet been announced.
"It can be more than a minute and less than 48 minutes", Wallton said on the Lakers' website.
Lakers broadcaster Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James appeared to have played a decent few minutes.
Following this week's payroll, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a preseason game at this point in my career to prepare", he replied.
Trump's time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began his election campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is one of five events Trump has planned for the next week, including several in public markets in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With confirmation of the vote pending to fill the Supreme Court seat, Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of the House in November's elections.
When is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you get online?
The time of the Trump rally in West Virginia is set for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia on YouTube via live stream.
Trump was expected to speak at this week's Supreme Court hearing on Brett Kavanaugh, which was complicated by the alleged rape attempt as the expected confirmation vote was delayed until next week while the FBI investigates.
But the intense work of all these conventions is helping Republicans to prepare well for the upcoming November elections.
Thus, President Trump's five-speed campaign this week focused on "empowering the Republican lobbyists and supporters to try to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congressional leadership is pushing the president to travel as we enter a busy election season", said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be quoted by Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's event is expected to draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and a large Pittsburgh radio audience", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, despite the state's record win in the 2016 election.
Trump was trying to help out West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who was unopposed in the election.
"It's not a good example for Morrisey that the president should come and help him increase the vote", said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the power of fighting to keep up hope as Sunday's one-on-one draws
After three one-sided games, Saturday's 4/4 game may be the Ryder Cup needed.
The swing of the momentum pendulum is a relatively new sport, one that has been embraced by players for some time, and one that is far superior to such a competition.
So where does the momentum come from?
"They're up six and now we're down four, so we think that's a strong addition", Jordan Spieth said as he awoke late that night.
In fact, Europeans were lucky, four points ahead with twelve games to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, felt they had a lot of wind to blow and a lot of incentive, including Spieth and Justin Thomas who had been out all day with three goals to four.
Spieth is the most famous for translating the color from tee to green as an example.
The party was getting more and more intense as his game progressed, with the difficulty of putting in four cards in each hand when he and Thomas had two.
His courage led to the 15th consecutive game of the same championship, a celebration that would have meant that he believed the American team would not withdraw.
"You just have to sing your heart out and worry about your game", Spieth said.
The remainder of the bread was the same for each of the groups.
18 holes to make a seal.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undisputed Ryder Cup champions.
These two Europeans are in the 4th out of 4 and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only two people who could not get into the bogey on Saturday night, but also did not want to hit the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday evening and after 9 on Friday morning.
The run, and the power display from the crowd, ensured that the players were the winners on Sunday, and no other player of note would determine a European victory at sunset for Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
A sudden event in a different world.
Yet, the European reputation is still far from satisfactory.
The performances of Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson gave Sergio Garcia, who was the morning's winner, a lasting impression, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The bogeyman then sent two doubles ahead of the ninth to put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they could not get out of.
No one is to carry you out of the pit on the Sabbath day.
Games 4 and 4 are interesting to watch closely because of the two-on-one relationships between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the game can change in a short period of time.
Europe have been a very good team so far and they are the best team going into the final day of the season but the fourth and fourth games of the season show that Team USA has a lot of potential that some, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
Europe led 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe had a good chance of entering the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's Game 4 win and a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Two different boys Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-point conversion to Tiger Woods, who was attempting to add four more points at Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, eager to reclaim the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, led the American team in the fourth and fourth matches of the morning, with a 3-1 lead.
The U.S. team was trying to improve on their fourth and fourth games, winning two games, but they were not able to reach the finals.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to win the cup.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four consecutive titles when she and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a strong weekend performance, managed just four in four games since the Ryder Cup began.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in games 4 and 4 and playing hard to beat the weary Woods and his new American teammate Bryson Dechambeau by just one point in games 5 and 4.
Woods, who has been in and out of the lineup in the last two games on Saturday, has shown some good form but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourth and fourth and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting in games 4 and 4 this morning, returns to face Henrik Stenson in games 4 and 4 and defeats Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1- respectively world number 1 and 3.
Not all Europeans were up on this beautiful, breezy day in western Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas began to establish themselves as the best Americans with their two goals on Saturday.
They had a 2-1 lead over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in games 4 and 4 and a comeback to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in games 4 and 4 after having opened the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has come back from a four-game losing streak and entered the playoffs as a one-on-one match, even though Furyk's team needs a draw to retain the trophy.
After finishing second in the standings on those days, Sunday's game looks set to be a tough one.
North Korea says 'no way' of isolating its nuclear power without confidence
North Korean foreign observers told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions reinforce the mistrust of the United States and that the country would not give up its nuclear weapons in the face of the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea had taken "significant steps" in the past year, including halting nuclear tests, dismantling testing sites and eliminating nuclear weapons.
"However, we are not seeing any response from the U.S"., he said.
"If there is no confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and then there will be no effective means of disarming ourselves".
While Ri echoed North Korea's popular complaint about Washington's refusal to pursue "unprecedented" denuclearization measures that would be rewarded if North Korea took a series of steps, his remarks were richer in that they did not deny the denuclearization of its allies as Pyang has done in recent times.
Ri was referring to remarks made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work on "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to provide North Korea with comprehensive security.
North Korea is trying to find a way out of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claims that Pyongyang has already renounced its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls for sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has insisted on 'first nuclear disarmament' and on increasing pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive manner, as well as rejecting 'termination of hostilities'", he said.
"The idea that we can be banned is a dream come true for people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the repeated bans only add to our distrust".
Ri was referring to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. president had announced at the United Nations earlier this week.
The official cited three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the talk of denuclearization were more about South Korea than the U.S., denuclearization on the Korean peninsula would not be so hard".
Ri's remarks, however, were a far cry from what he said this year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea's targeting of the U.S. was inevitable after "Evil President" Trump called Kim a "constructionist".
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps toward denuclearization, but said there was much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump did not have the time frame for the project, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months - don't worry".
China and Russia have demanded that the U.N. Security Council hold Pyongyang accountable for its actions.
Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must be maintained until we have a complete and definitive elimination of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has extended sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to reduce the cost of nuclear weapons.
Pompeo met Ri during the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second session.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July with the message that things were going well, but within hours North Korea had responded by saying that it was planning "a terrorist-like operation".
North Korea is set to meet Moon this month to discuss the destruction of a nuclear facility and a nuclear test site if the United States takes "extraordinary measures".
He said Kim was told that "special measures" were needed to secure Trump's promised vaccines in Singapore and to work toward improving relations with Washington.
Harvard students start a study on proper rest
A new study at Harvard University this year has encouraged new students to sleep more in order to reduce the "macho" habit of reading "all day" with coffee.
One teacher found that students of a major international school were often ignorant of the subject of scriptures to guide their lives.
Charles Czeisler, a specialist in sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted what he called the first study of its kind in the US.
They were encouraged to start the study after discussing how sleep deprivation interferes with learning.
'At the end of their talk one girl came up and said: 'Why was I told this late in my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him anything about the richness of sleep - to my surprise, he told the Telegraph.
The study, which was first launched this year, shows students the benefits of good sleep for academic and athletic performance, as well as for health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and head of the health department there, said that the school decided to introduce the study after finding that students were sleep deprived during the week.
This hour-long study includes a number of interactive activities.
One article features a picture of a bedroom where students were placed on coffee cups, study materials, and books to be told about the effects of coffee and light and how speed is disrupted by lack of sleep and the amount of sleep that is measured.
In another study, students were taught that prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
School maps, along with discussion boards, also encourage students to reflect on their daily activities.
'we know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health risks of your choice to smoke,' adds Prof. Czeisler.
The proud tradition of 'reading too much' still exists, they said, adding that the current trends and increasing demand from students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, adequate sleep can be a "great" weapon for students to overcome stress, fatigue, and stress, they said - even to lose weight, since sleep deprivation depletes the brain, leaving students constantly hungry.
Professor Czeisler was assisted in the study by Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian chemist and physical biologist, who had studied one of his studies last year during his first year at Harvard.
She said that this study opened her eyes and encouraged her to make the study of all the students in the school a priority.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduating students to take this course before entering highly competitive industries.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting a bedtime alarm, including a wake-up time, and alerting to the dangers of blue light and LED lights, which can interfere with the human sleep cycle, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Blood bowl brings Gerrard's men to the ground
Rangers were again defeated on home soil when Dolly Menga's goal scored disrupted Steven Gerrard's united team and resulted in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox were aiming for their first victory in the competition since their 4-1 win over St. Johnsone in the Championship last month, but Gary Holt's team was hampered by Gerrard's second win in 18 games as captain leaving his side eight games behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored with seven minutes to go and the Rangers' weakness was not enough to catch them.
With Rangers now back in sixth place, Livingston climbed to third behind Hibernian in the division.
Rangers also appeared to be in trouble after goalkeeper Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after being hit by a long-range projectile.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances for his side as they beat Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfre Cup.
Holt's team, on the other hand, had the same Liv 11 that had taken one Hearts this week and was very impressed to see how well-trained their team had defeated their opponents.
The Rangers had a lot of time on their hands, but Livingston was the one who made the most of his catch.
He was only two minutes into the first half when Menga's first field goal sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder opened his opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's kickoff went to goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow hit the ball back into the net.
The Rangers were starting to turn the ball over, but there seemed more hope than hope for their play in the third-last period.
Alfredo Morelos thinks he should have had a penalty in the quarter when he and Steven Lawless fought but the quarterback Steven Thomson refused the Colombian's complaint.
Rangers were only beaten on two occasions but former Ibrox defender Liam Kelly was unharmed by headliners Lassana Coulibaly and younger brother Ovie Ejaria.
When Levi's 34th-minute goal was tied at halftime, there was no question that the goal was needed because of the crowd.
The Rangers also lost to the heavily favored Jacobs.
Scott Arfield was silent when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his breath to take Menga to an easy finish.
Gerrard worked through the half when he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change made a difference when the quarterback passed Morelos but coach Kelly ran out of his box and went into a growl.
Livingston, however, continued to follow the visitors to the same ballgame as his favorite, with Lithgow and Halket scoring consecutive goals.
Holt's side led the final half but McGregor stopped Jacobs before Lithgow hit a long header from a distance.
Rangers' starting catcher Glenn Middleton has another penalty kick against Jacobs but Thomson has again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
Now it is a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THIS is the date on which the German physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the invention of the Geiger Counter.
The basis of scientific astronomy since its invention, the Geiger Counter has also become a cultural reference, as in the 1950 collection "Bells of Coronado", which featured some of the most prominent scientists including Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is truth?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, a device used to measure radioactivity in some minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these in your ears, you can feel the energy of the atoms in the rock that are formed by the radioactivity inside".
Evans: "So you're saying it was designed!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the instrument bearing his name still exists.
A new antibody may train the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new antibody may train the immune system to "see" and kill cancer cells
A vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as a treatment
This involves taking immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory
It can then "search" for and replicate the protein that is common in many cancers
The study's vaccine offers hope for patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize cancer cells, was amazed to see how her testicular cancer had survived for more than 18 months.
This involves taking immune cells from the patient, converting them in the laboratory to "find" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinserting them into the body.
"Our results show that we have the potential for a highly effective vaccine", said Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 cancers "control a number of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same technique of taking immune cells from patients and "training" them to attack cancer cells has been used to treat a form of leukemia.
Kanye West launches a campaign to praise Trump for his Blatant Rumours, wearing a MAGA Hat, after his appearance on SNL.
Failed
Kanye West was thrown into the studio for his Saturday night performance on Saturday Night Live after a high-pitched speech praising U.S. President Donald Trump and his 2020 presidential bid.
After performing his third song of the day, Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great hat, he sang a series of Democratic slurs and spoke in support of Trump.
"I often hear white people say: 'How can you like Trump, a racist?'
"If I had been worried about racism, I would have left America", he said.
SNL began its show with Hollywood comedian Matt Damon making a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on his alleged sexual assault allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast on radio, West's performance was featured on a media show with comedian Chris Rock.
It was unclear whether Rock was actually criticizing West for posting this on social media.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had a back problem because of the headdress.
"I have been persecuted a lot lately.
'Come ahead with that suit,' they say.
I am being persecuted!
And they think I'm in a bad place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the hill?" and that he was "putting on my victory hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Follow the course of love".
His comments drew a roar and the SNL audience seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, with one source telling the paper: "The whole studio was silent".
West was a late addition to the cast as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, singer Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love it, dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West was joined by conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of you has a brave spirit: I HELP YOU STAND BRAVELY IN THE WAR".
But the show's host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "showed what he was and what he was good at".
"But I choose NOT to pay tribute to someone (by buying his music or clothes or sponsoring his "bike") who I know is carrying and saying dangerous things around me.
He was free.
We are too", he added.
Before the show, the singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "a man who used to be called Kanye West".
He is the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, becoming known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another musician, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion and Prince, changed his name to the former Prince logo.
The verdict on the attempted murder case in Belfast's food court
A 45-year-old man was found guilty of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a Belfast nightclub on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The case was expected to be heard in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The cases will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington is particularly angry about the abuse of women
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old model is furious at the macho hero's contempt, saying that the sex scenes mean that boys must be bold to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit felt that something was wrong and was keen to find a solution to this violence in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, said that she felt that she 'had to work harder' to deal with the problem.
'I feel for myself, that I should work hard, right now - where have we been fighting for our manhood?' he said.
'What are we teaching the men to grow up, given the problems we see today?'
Kit says that the media is responsible for the increase in male bullying because of the high rate of male violence.
He continued: 'What do we have and what do we learn?
Does the media, the media, and the streets make boys feel that they have to be that way to be considered men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time - can we change the world?
Because there is something wrong with boys.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be planning any further remakes or productions of Game of Thrones when the current schedule ends next summer, and said that he was "getting away from the horse fighting game".
From November Kit will be featured in Sam Shepard's upcoming drama series True West, which is the story of a fictional detective and his dim-witted brother.
The actor has revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of the Game of Thrones franchise.
'I met my wife at the show, so in that way the show gave me my future family, and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning show.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new HIV infections
China has reported a jump in the number of its population living with HIV and AIDS to 14%.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, says the health-care provider.
A record 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Unlike previously, many of the people mentioned were infected by the virus.
In the past, HIV transmission in China has been largely through blood transfusions.
But the number of new HIV infections has now been brought back to almost zero, health officials told a meeting in Yunnan Province.
Compared with previous years, however, the number of new HIV and Aids cases in China has soared by more than 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in China, which has a high LGBT population.
Homosexual violence was outlawed in China in 1997, but LGBT violence is reported to be worse.
Because of the traditionalistic climate, studies show that 70-90% of homosexuals end up marrying women who are not their own.
Many of the most serious infections are caused by a lack of adequate protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide HIV vaccines to all its citizens as a way to combat the epidemic.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP senator's leaked report spreads 'dangerous lies' and 'suspicious stories'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied a rumor that a member of her staff had posted a profile of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the suspicion was being made by "right-wingers" of political media and websites.
"Lies, lies, lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The broadcast reportedly included house calls and phone numbers for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The article appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unidentified source on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on the alleged attempted assassination of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The news spread after the three senators had finished their trial of Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState claimed that the IP address that identified the sender was linked to Waters' office and spread the word about Waters' employee, Hill's paper said.
"This unproven assumption is a very dark and dark lie", said Waters.
"My servant, whom you have appointed for signs, for prophecies, and for divinations, for this deceitful and lying divination, has not spread the word in truth.
"This unproven suspicion is a most dangerous and dark lie.
Waters' comments quickly gained traction on social media, including White House correspondent Ari Fleischer.
"This is a bitter refusal", wrote Fleischer.
"This means that he did not feel that he was a member of the Law Council.
When someone is falsely accused, there is no need to be angry.
He should not use anger to justify himself.
He did not have to ask why the accuser stood.
He must be mild-tempered and patient".
Fleischer was trying to match Waters' anger with the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was suspected by prosecutors of being extremely angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who sought to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also took to Twitter.
"The big question is whether it's true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had "consulted with relevant parties and law enforcement officials regarding this alleged crime.
"We will ensure that the criminals are caught", he said, "and that they are held accountable for their destructive and dangerous actions against everyone and their agents".
Johnny English is back - Rowan Atkinson's experiment in comedy
It is now a tradition to compare Brexit to all the new trends in British history and what is happening to this new comedy franchise called the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and will return in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Would it provide a humorous commentary on the problematic history of our country's ability to export?
In any case, Johnny English's bright, unassuming face is holding up his second entertainment license - a title that shows his greatest dedication to the non-English-speaking world of the comedy genre.
One character uses a simple joke to entertain you by incorporating the comedy of a little Scout, in imitation of Mr Bean and another in a manner similar to that of the voice-over to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
And at first he relied on the now-forgotten traveling international Atkinson, who was on the Barclaycard TV network, to prevent any trouble from coming his way.
There are one or two positive aspects to the new JE system.
I was delighted to see Johnny English flying in a helicopter in a vintage military suit with the wings of the plane gently touching his nose.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is apparent, but comedy sometimes seems to be weakened and sometimes over-exaggerated, especially when the comedy-variety series  such as 007 and Mission Impossible are seen as more modern improvements
The entertainment seems more geared toward younger audiences than older ones, and in many cases Johnny English is not as well-rounded as Atkinson's performance as Bean.
The theme of this year's issue is Great Britain in crisis.
A cybercriminal has infiltrated a secret network of British spies, revealing the identity of every British agent who has been dispatched, much to the surprise of someone on the job at the time - a small task for Kevin Eldon.
This is a difficult task for a proud and troubled prime minister, who is suffering from a decline in her leadership and political profile: Emma Thompson has done well in the role of quasi-Teresa-May but there is little in the agenda of the coordinating speech to do.
The overseers were told that when all the work was done, they should relieve all who had stopped working.
This includes the troublemaker Johnny English, who now serves as principal of a school, but who offers a series of tips on how to operate undercover: one of the funniest is here, when English was teaching psychic studies at the School of Rock.
English is taken to Whitehall for a spring meeting and then meets his former friend and fellow sufferer Bough, a position also held by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, and is placed with the captain of the first ship, the famous lady of the Vicki Pepperdine seemingly exhausted.
The unstoppable threat of the Her Majesty's Secret Service is back in force and the potential replacement for Olga Kurylenko is Ophelia Bulletova.
On the other hand, the prime minister is being ensnared by the dangerous threat of a wealthy philanthropist who claims to solve Britain's philanthropic problems: the threat of Jason Volta, a role played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough's imaginary journey begins: posing as waiters, they are shown a French restaurant; they bring a snack while escaping on Volta's luxury yacht; and English brings a snack when he tries to use Virtual Reality headphones to get a better idea of the architecture of Volta's house.
All the evidence has been removed for the final screening, but as good and entertaining as it is, the children's concerns are still in the story.
A little bit of everything.
And then, like so many of the Johnny English films, I thought: why not give the British film industry a role that would make Rowan Atkinson the best person she could be?
The Labour Party has rejected proposals to change the British work week to four days and pay the British workers five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a plan to make Britain work four days a week - instead of five.
The party reportedly wants executives to take away the money generated by artificial intelligence (AI) and give it to employees by giving them an extra day off.
This will give workers three days off each weekend - but at the same salary.
The presenters said that these plans would "be economically viable" and would "change the world for the better".
The move to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as a way to relieve workers during the economic downturn.
A Labour official told the Sunday Times: 'The revision of this text is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not be a short-term but a four-day workweek that is aligned with the socialist agenda of improving the living conditions of workers and the economic system.'
Labour will not be the first to achieve this goal, while the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election.
However, the plan is not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not even a party idea.'
Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used this week's Labour Party conference to reiterate his vision of economic and business empowerment.
McDonnell said he was particularly committed to taking power away from "unintended bosses" and "extreme profiteers" in the public service industries.
The scheme is a shadow chancellor and means that shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover all their money because the Labour government may "repay" some of the money for certain wrongdoing.
They also approved plans to train workers in corporate organizations and to create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds by providing 10 percent of the company's equity to employees, who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the suspected involvement of Judge Brett Kavanaugh in the final vote in his Supreme Court election is a week away, and raises the question of whether the findings of the criminal investigation will influence the Republican senators' decision to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday night with "60 Minutes", reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find any evidence that would change their minds.
Kennedy, too, seemed to be more relaxed than his South Carolina counterparts.
"I hope so", said Kennedy.
"I went to the trial, I went to see Judge Kavanaugh.
I sent to him at once to inquire whether the scoundrel had come, and said, 'Is it well with thee?'
He was courageous, courageous, and unwavering".
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be unchanged.
"My focus is on Brett Kavanaugh and only the power of hate can distract me", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett is a failure", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No one can prove you to me.
That was 36 years ago.
I've never seen anything new that changes".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring a variety of musicians, in pursuit of a major mission; to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival draws tens of thousands of visitors to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to hear the music of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to raise awareness about the potential of music to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an initiative of the Global Poverty Project, an international organization that hopes to end poverty by increasing participation in the fight against poverty.
To qualify for a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), participants must complete a set of tasks, or "tasks", such as volunteering, emailing a political leader, making a phone call, or performing any other public service mission.
But has the Global Citizen project achieved anything in the 12 years since it began?
Are free concert tickets a legitimate way to get people to ask for a job or just another form of "clickbait" - to get people to feel like they're doing something by signing up for a talk or tweeting a story?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reported that it has received more than 19 million job applications from supporters, urging more to be done.
He said that these efforts helped to force world leaders to announce a $37 billion budget and a commitment to help the population reach 2.25 billion by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has made 390 commitments and announcements about its activities, of which about $10 billion has been raised and distributed.
The group says that the funds raised have helped 649 million people worldwide.
Among these pledges is The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. corporate charity that aims to "help children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to help Rwanda address the country's food crisis after receiving 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can work to make the global food crisis a myth of its own", The Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a concert in London in March 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 petitions to the U.K. government to improve breastfeeding for mothers and their babies, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million mothers and children with quality nutrition.
You can find answers to the FAQ on their website that asks "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It is a long and difficult process - we fail and fail at times.
But like all the other movements for racial equality, we will win, because when we work together, we are strong.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's concert in New York City, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US government could use Navy as "guard" against Russian imports - Secretary of State
Washington could use the navy "if necessary" to block Russian goods from reaching markets, including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's ties with Syria - apparently, where it was acting on behalf of a loyal government - were a pretext for testing the power lines.
"I think they were in the Middle East because they wanted to talk about the power of the Middle East, like they do in Eastern Europe, and in Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the governor, there are ways to do it.
"The United States has the ability, through our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, closed, to ensure that their goods do not enter the markets", he said.
Zinke was speaking to an audience at a conference sponsored by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an organization that has been called "the voice of the energy industry in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, saying that they were the same.
"The economic impact of Iran and Russia, to a lesser or greater extent, is to improve the efficiency and replacement of oil", he said, referring to Russia as a "sniper in one area" in its reliance on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration is expanding its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is costing European consumers more.
As a result, the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, is trying to force Germany to withdraw from the "unprecedented" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Moscow "a slave to Berlin".
Moscow has repeatedly referred to the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to supplement an existing 110 billion cubic meter pipeline, as a commercial development project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington's refusal to do so is purely commercial and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we reject the idea that energy cannot be a coercive tool and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US government's actions have drawn criticism from Germany for its re-engagement.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the US government to withdraw from EU energy agreements and the Berlin-Moscow talks.
"I see a major problem in the intrusion of a great power into our energy infrastructure", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "Very Good" to Run for President in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she should consider  running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren made it clear that he was considering running.
"It is time for our women to go to Washington and fix the broken government and what it means to be a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will begin to consider my candidacy for president".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during a town hall rally, saying that he was "taking the world by storm.
"I am deeply concerned about Donald Trump's handling of our rights that he has not been able to exercise", she said.
Warren is one of the most vocal critics of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "we definitely need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that many people, including Warren's constituency, did not think he should run in the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of skeptical voters in Massachusetts said Warren should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
As many as 32 percent supported such a representation.
The poll showed a strong support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of his candidacy and 48 percent opposed.
Other top names in the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential race include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will vote in January, reports Associated Press
Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD by Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a violent crime that took place on Monday night.
"My son's experience, his return experience, I can relate to other families who are going through the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our veterans come back with", he told a crowd attending a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for Donald Trump.
Palin said that the kidnapping was like a "lion in the room" and that her son and other soldiers "come back angry, come back brave, come back questioning whether there is still the dignity that there is for fellow soldiers, airmen, and other soldiers, to give up their country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault, disruption of a police officer's mess and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 cities in D.C. support the passage of a new public safety bill
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia supported the passage of a new U.S. law that prohibits the admission and protection of people fleeing violent or domestic oppression.
Representatives from 18 cities and states wrote a friend-of-the-court letter on Friday in Washington in support of a petition challenging the verse, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in January to challenge the government's ruling, was not disclosed.
The girl claimed that her friend "and her gang members" were harassing her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
He was raised in Texas.
City attorneys for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as the most dangerous places for people seeking asylum from the U.S. government, as well as the most dangerous places for domestic violence.
The new U.S. immigration law reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new provision "revolutionizes decades of national and international urban law".
"The federal law requires that any request for protection be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the request, and such a refusal is contrary to the provisions of this clause", said the friend-of-the-court.
The defense also argued that the immigration clause was a barrier to U.S. trade, and that these people could become traders and "provide jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges to provide protection for those fleeing the repression of crime and domestic violence during the month of October.
"Protection is available to those who have left their home countries because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his May 11 statement announcing the resolution.
The vaccine is not designed to solve all the problems - even the most serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
Search and rescue efforts continue in Palu as the death toll rises
For those who survived, the situation was not good.
"It sounds difficult", said a 35-year-old woman named Risa Kusuma, as she quietly laid her baby at a shelter for survivors in the city of Palu.
"Every time an ambulance comes in, more bodies are brought in.
Clean water is scarce".
The villagers seemed to return to their ruined homes, picking up some of the wreckage, trying to pick up what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured back and a concussion, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for seismic events.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the quake that shook the fifth floor of a hotel where he lived with his wife and child.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think, I was trapped in the broken walls", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are at peace".
U.S. ambassador accuses China of being a "bully" with "hard propaganda"
Less than a week after a Chinese newspaper published a U.S. trade paper that discussed the potential benefits of U.S.-China trade relations, the U.S. embassy in China arranged for Beijing to use the American paper to make a critical statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday criticized the China Daily and its successor, the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after it organized a Chinese bid to participate in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a move China denies.
Trump's criticism of Beijing's interference in the U.S. election confirmed what some U.S. officials told Reuters as a new strategy Washington is seeking to use to threaten China.
While it is common for foreign countries to place advertisements in newspapers, Beijing and Washington are locked in a bitter trade war that has led to rising tariffs on goods from one country to another.
Tariffs on Chinese goods were imposed earlier this year to target imported goods in cities such as Iowa that have been a strong supporter of Trump's Republican Party, Chinese business analysts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, from a large agricultural community in China, said Beijing had been a great injustice to American workers, farmers and businessmen.
"China is now adding to the pressure by advertising harsh commercials in our free newspapers", wrote Branstad in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper.
"By advertising these expensive products, the Chinese government is exposing American free speech and free press by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on a newsstand on a street here in Beijing, you find few critical comments and no disagreements that Chinese people might have about China's apparent economic slowdown, which is due to the Chinese Communist Party's control of the media", they wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish" his article, though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans discriminate against women voters in midterm elections over Kavanaugh Report, warns news reviewers
At a time when many Republicans support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of attempted rape, analysts have warned of a wave of attacks, especially on women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment surrounding the issue was high, with many Republicans reportedly already ready to vote for it.
That is irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an interview published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) recent push for an FBI investigation would revive the anger of angry voters.
"Women will never forget yesterday - not tomorrow and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, executive director and spokeswoman for the advocacy group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they marched through the Senate chamber as the Republican Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"The Democratic will and will must be based on the written word", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan news analyst, told an online news site.
"People say it's too much; it's true.
But it is even more so among women and younger local voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they dislike the president, are not allowed to vote".
Even before Ford gave a damning testimony about his alleged attempted rape by a Supreme Court nominee, critics said that the attack would be more likely if Republicans insisted on it.
"This has become a major problem for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or whether Kavanaugh was elected, it's about how the Republicans took the issue and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, executive director of Priorities USA, a campaign group that supports the Democratic candidates, told a news conference.
However, the American public seemed divided over Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's, with many supporting Kavanaugh.
A recent YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents either strongly or strongly disagreed with Ford's testimony, and another 35 percent said they strongly or strongly disagreed with Kavanaugh's testimony.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied in his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford's testimony.
Following Flake's arrest, the FBI is now investigating Ford's allegation along with another suspect, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh was assaulted while drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez also said that the Supreme Court nominees had shown him a hidden dress at a Yale graduation ceremony in the early 1980's.
The inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Build a World Wide Web that will Replace Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is developing a new technology that will rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technologist was called Inrupt, a new company working on the Berners-Lee Solid software.
Solid prediction allows users to choose where their story should be stored and who should see the story and when they should see the story.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the main goal of Inrupt's development was to "take over the world".
"We need to do this now", he said of the device.
"It is for a time to be determined in the future".
The app uses Solid's proprietary technology to allow users to create a "continuous online archive" or POD.
There are schedules, activities, dates, music, and other superhuman tools to work with.
The app is designed to allow Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify to be on the same page at the same time.
Unlike the news archives in this tool, it is up to the user to choose which content to display and to whom to show it.
The company called the tool "empowering everyone through my talk".
The design of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, calls for a company-wide set of tools, services and expertise to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now included Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security consultant who was bought by IBM, other volunteers who had been invited to work on the project, and volunteers who had worked on coding.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own devices using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not consulting "Facebook and Google to develop a new technology that would transform their entire business in a short time.
"We do not ask for permission".
In a statement posted on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission" of the Inrupt toolkit is to provide a business and service capability that helps protect the integrity and value of the new Solid web toolkit".
In the year 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the web when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has been talking a lot about the equality of the Internet.
When Inrupt was launched, Berners-Lee was still the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I have high hopes for this new era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Chaplain of the WW1 Victoria Cross awarded
The only Church of England priest who won the Victoria Cross during World War I was buried in the town where he lived 100 years ago.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and then on Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a gunman four days later, unaware that he had won the highest decoration in the British military.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called it "a great sign" that the stone should be unveiled on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on the night of September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his squadron through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a misty fog with the guns blazing".
He then marched up the line of defense "with great courage" as he led the gunmen forward and shot himself, killing three soldiers.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German soldier on October 4, 1918 - less than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "things I probably wouldn't have done but were wonderful.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid flowers after the ceremony, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to be part of the celebration" and added that "the reputation of a person who has done something great is reflected in the support of the many donors".
MMA fans wait all night to see Bellator 206, but they are shown Peppa Pid
Imagine, you have been up all night watching Bellator 206 but have not seen what you were waiting for.
The San Jose broadcast featured 13 professional wrestling matches, including six on the card, and was broadcast live across the UK on Radio 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to get married, UK viewers were surprised when the network switched to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel uncomfortable after staying up late into the night or even late into the night.
One Twitter user described the change in schedule and the showing of the children's game as "a dangerous toy".
"It's a federal policy that the program is not allowed to air at 6 a.m. " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's executive editor of media and communications, when asked about the incident.
""Pray to the pig", yes".
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said that the show would be rescheduled to include U.K. viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the show's reruns, I think we can do that", said Coker.
"But it is the sixth hour there, and it is not lawful for us to do anything until the day on which we celebrate the Sabbath, which is the first day of the week.
But we are working on it.
I know that after the change of the watch, many messages were not good.
We struggled to fix them, thinking that something was wrong.
But that was not the case.
I promise this will never happen again.
Now we're going to show five matches in the sixth season - as we always do - we wanted to impress the audience but we were too busy.
It was a sad thing".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'unemployed' because of his design
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley said that he grew up feeling unemployed to anyone because of his sexuality - but that it gave him the motivation to make a difference in the world.
A 24-year-old did not realize until high school that "other people are not crazy".
During her first Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she was speaking out for the rights of single people to give them "hope".
He also said that being a boxer had helped him to reduce his anxiety about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host, Kirsty Young, is on a month's leave of absence for health reasons.
Appearing as the unemployed man in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it was not acceptable to be attracted to both boys and girls".
"To this day", he says, "those feelings of inferiority, of being special, are some of the things that give me strength and motivation to do something in the world".
He wanted to be sure that he "was something", so that some would not be embarrassed when they learned something about his creation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a hot topic among LGBT supporters and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on other countries to lift restrictions on gay marriage.
He said that he felt that he was blessed to be free from oppression and that he wanted others to have "hope".
The three-time world champion said that a young man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "touched my heart".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior this year but said that the age difference between them did not bother her.
"If you have such a difficult childhood" - she went to the Olympics at 14 and her father died three years later - she said it was hard to find someone who had the same day, the same ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his faces" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, my answer would always be that I wanted to win the gold", he said.
"You know, there are more important things than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is now Robbie".
Her son shares the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father was not sure he was dying and the question was not about tickets to London in 2012 - he was anxious to get a seat in the front row.
"Why did I tell you", he said, "that you would not be able to sit in the Father's house?"
"I held their hand until they died, and when they died, I knew that they too could be defeated", he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to perform in front of a home crowd at the Olympics", he said.
That led to his selection of the theme song - Proud by Heather Small - which he had been singing all along in preparation for the Olympics and which had given him anxiety.
The Desert Island Discs program is broadcast regularly on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson sidelined for a poor performance in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American professional Phil Mickelson will make a name for himself on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to work hard to avoid his most frustrating season.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th doubleheader of the year, was placed alongside his captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's game 4 and 4.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he always is when playing in the United States, the eight-time champion divides his day between being a celebrity and working with his team to solve problems that plague him.
Never a perfect driver at his best, the 48-year-old is unable to compete at Le Golf National course, where the length of the course is often a challenge to the impact of the mud.
And if height alone is not a problem, Mickelson, in his ninth match on Sunday, will have to face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed with top player Tommy Fleetwood to win his fourth match of the week.
If the Americans, who are four points off their 12-game lead, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game will be a little bit more difficult.
Furyk has complete confidence in this man, and he is not afraid to say something else.
"She knows exactly what she has to do today, she touches me on the back and hugs me and says she'll be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has faith in himself alone.
He's one of the hardest-working Hall of Famers and he's done a lot of additions to these teams in the last few days, and this week.
I never thought he would do it twice.
I had hoped to do more than that, but that did not happen, and now we have to make up our minds.
He wanted to be there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson will beat Faldo in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of his Ryder Cup career where he never matched the size of his own stature.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses, and one draw, although Furyk said his participation had brought the team a lot of good things.
"He is funny, sometimes difficult to talk about, cheerful, likes to tell people funny things, and a great person to have in a room", she explained.
"I hope the youngsters enjoyed the game, as did you, and this week was fun.
She has more than she bargained for".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his most famous leadership could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that his famous lead into the final days of the Ryder Cup singles can turn him into a quick-wheeler.
The Danish rider made his first appearance at the 1997 games in Valderrama, where team captain Seve Ballesteros had to beat the Americans by five points but finished in a close tie for 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Always remember that we were way ahead at Valderrama; we were way ahead at Brookline, where we lost, and then at Valderrama, where we won", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and the day before and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the past and the present would indicate that the matter is not settled.
Tomorrow you will be in full force.
Go and do what you can.
The matter will not be resolved until you have the necessary resolve.
We do not run, or run, to win the crown, but we do not exert ourselves in this way.
I always say that my attention is on the 12 players on our side, but we know very well who are on the other side - the strongest players in the world".
Appreciating the performance of his team in a crowded stadium, Bjorn added: "I can't try to work without preparation in this case.
Tomorrow is the night of the meeting of the beast.
Tomorrow is a special day, and this is a special occasion.
It is good to be with a friend and to be successful; but when you are alone, you are tempted to the point of being a golf club.
This is the message you should spread to the workers, that you should get all the benefits of your work tomorrow.
But let your companion go, and he must do his best just as you do yours".
Following Bjorn, number one Jim Furyk will need more players per side than he would have if he were in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have three goals in four games.
Furyk himself was present at this final turning point, being part of the victorious team at Brookline before the European "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every word that was said about this", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, led his team to the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow night, but you might want to go to that first start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When this force is concentrated on one side, it tends to be applied to the central nervous system.
Let's get the players in line and put the guys in the right position, you know, try to work a miracle tomorrow night".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead a rematch against Rory McIlroy in the top flight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter from Europe on the other side of the field.
"I joined a group of boys in this way because I thought it would go all the way", said Bjorn about his team's individual selection.
German battleship again enlarged
The new German Navy ship was scheduled to enter service in 2014 to replace older Cold War war ships, but was not commissioned until this year, due to equipment failures and rising costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until early 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to enter the Navy's fleet in 2014, but problems with the ship's transportation delayed the completion of the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class submarines purchased by the Navy in 2007 were intended to replace the aging Bremen-class submarines.
It is reported to have a powerful radio telescope, a variety of aircraft and ships, and other technological devices, such as long-range, infrared and navigation instruments.
Another important feature of these vessels is their long maintenance life - they can be dispersed from shore for up to two years.
However, the long delay means that the best ships expected to provide German naval support will be inadequate by the time they enter service, Die Zeit reported.
The seemingly slow-moving F125 was in the dock all year when the Navy refused to open her and return her to the Blohm & Voss dockyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to its original owner after receiving it.
The reasons for the rescue were unclear, but German media reported "problems with software and equipment" that could have made the ship unsuitable for rescue.
The technical problems were particularly acute because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be manned by 120 personnel - half the number of the older Bremen class.
Also, it was found that the ship was too heavy to carry and that it would reduce the Army's ability to make further improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of a similar ship used in World War II by Germany.
In addition to the problematic equipment, the cost of all the work - including the training of drivers - was a major problem.
The price is reported to be €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from the original price of €2.2 billion.
The challenges faced by the new ships were particularly acute in the face of the declining German naval presence.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German defense department, said that the Red Army was "not getting enough ships to send to the border".
He said that the problem would only get worse in time, as older ships would be scrapped and replaced with new ones.
The complaint was that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be commissioned into the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secrets of the dark world.
A study in the Scottish Highlands is investigating how plants use their land and environment to grow.
It is hoped that the new findings will help shed new light on the behavior of these flying animals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The scientific study at the National Trust for Scotland will include the common horned lizard and the soprano pipistrelle as well as the long-eared lizard and the Daubenton lizard at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Sound recorders will be placed in the surrounding area to follow the pattern of the lights.
NHS staff and volunteers will be testing the affected devices.
A red noise analysis is performed on all sounds by hearing the sounds of dark waves and dark waves acting in a variety of ways.
The map of the area and the street will then be used to create a larger picture of the harsh and dark conditions.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the findings will reveal which areas are most vulnerable to climate change and how each is affected.
This will help to understand the importance of conserving wetlands and conserving the trees where the trees and other wildlife live.
The number of mountains in Scotland and the UK has declined over the past century.
It is threatened by construction and development projects that disrupt bird habitats and destroy bird habitats.
Wind and light generators are also hazards, as are fishing rods and some weapons-grade materials, and rat bites.
The time is not far.
However, because of its taste characteristics, its ears are used more than its eyes to locate food.
They use a special auditory system to locate insects and prey on their path.
The NTS, which manages 270 historic buildings, 38 luxury gardens, and 76,000 hectares of wildlife around the country, has a special interest in the forests.
The team consists of ten specialists, who perform research, surveillance and sometimes rescue.
The Society has also established Scotland's first and only national park at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species of butterfly.
Park director David Thompson said that the area was a perfect environment for the mountain.
"Here on Threave we have a large plot of land", he said.
"We have old houses, many old trees and a beautiful bird sanctuary.
But there are other mysteries, and our work here will help us to understand what it takes for them to survive".
He explained the value of monitoring the nest before any work is done, since destruction of one nesting site can kill up to 400 adults and young, wiping out the entire population.
Farms are protected and are subject to killing, harassment, or destruction of their habitat
Elisabeth Ferrell, executive director of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to get involved.
"There is much to learn about our mountains", he says, "because we have so many species that we don't even know how they live".
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as prosecutors prepare to take a German magazine to court
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegation of sexual abuse "false", saying that "some people wanted to defend themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers were preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the suspicious report.
A Portuguese Juventus player is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was reportedly offered a reward of up to $375,000 for his report, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In his Instagram video to 142 million people after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the allegations as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is a lie", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, looking into the camera.
"They tried to use my name to make a name for themselves.
It does.
They want to be known by saying my name, but their work.
I am happy and everything is going well", she adds, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers wanted to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they said was "a false statement", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the taxpayer could seek damages for "a series of violations of privacy, the most serious violation of human rights in decades".
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a bar, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the hotel's lobby, where he allegedly raped her from behind, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and said he was "99 percent" a "healthy" person to say nothing of "1 percent"
The papers stated that Ronaldo admitted that the sexual relationship was real but was consensual.
Mayorga said that she went to the police to take pictures of the hospital, but later agreed to settle the case out of court because she "feared retaliation" and "public embarrassment".
The 34-year-old woman said that she now wanted to appeal the case because she was still reeling from the experience.
Ronaldo was in the process of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the news, and this time he was transferred to Italian side Juve for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'laughs forever' at car manufacturers
The UK would 'laugh forever' if it lost its position as the post-Brexit car maker, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disconcerting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a formal deal, it would stop production at its Burnaston site, near Derby.
"We need to agree", said Clark.
The Japanese car industry has warned that the potential impact of delayed border opening due to a no-deal Brexit could result in a large number of job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced up to 150,000 vehicles this year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of October we will see a production shutdown in our region", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concern about the prospect of a no-deal exit from the EU, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would be buying the Mini in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The biggest concern was the automotive industry's position on the market in the absence of Brexit negotiations.
Toyota's designs operate "on time", with deliveries arriving 37 minutes after the UK and EU sales of pre-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 October, there could be border disruption that they say could lead to delays and shortages.
It would be very difficult for Toyota to sit in the Derbyshire area for a day without a production run, the company said, and that would cause production to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's plans for a future relationship with the EU "are well designed to avoid these border risks".
"We need a consensus, a good dialogue and a good agreement that will allow us to, as I said, not only have the current momentum but to have the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The message from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we should stick to a standard that works for us in our business".
Toyota did not specify a timeline for the resumption of production, but in the long run, it has warned that rising prices could weaken competitive industries and lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston resident and president of the local labor union, said that his members were concerned: "From what I've seen, this kind of work is unlikely to happen again".
A government spokesman said: "We have prepared a good and complete plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
A meeting between Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the battle for supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump's ties to Russia and the president's judicial system.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, which could pose a threat to Mueller's freedom, has been a topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was planning to take a recording of his conversation with Trump and see if the president could be impeached by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein disputes this claim.
But the day before Monday, they had gone to the White House, where they received word that they were resigning.
In the meantime, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was hardly a coincidence.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed in the run-up to the Senate judiciary committee's impeachment hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of his alleged sexual assault victims, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both acquitted.
On Friday, Trump launched a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's correspondent, Sarah Sanders, was featured on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date of the meeting is not fixed, it could be this week, it could be that week because of the Supreme Court.
But we will talk and I always want to know the media about what is happening".
Some media outlets may object to this statement: Sanders has not had a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The program's host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders argued that the decline in media engagement was not a lack of "publicity", though he added: "I don't deny the fact that they are".
He also noted that Trump's interactions with the media are increasing.
"Our leaders have preferred Q&A sessions than any previous leaders", he said, adding without specifying when: "We have mentioned those numbers".
The talks are ongoing, Sanders said, but "if the media has any questions for the president of the United States, it would be better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that for a long time and you saw that last week and it's going to happen during the press conference when you talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions on his way out of the White House or during interviews or press conferences with invited guests.
Talking to the media in person is not uncommon.
In New York City this week authorities showed a sense of urgency, a willingness and sometimes a surprise to the media.
Health secretary writes to EU health staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Secretary of the Health Sector wrote to the EU health staff working at the NHS site in Scotland to express his deep appreciation for continuing to work at the site post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP wrote to him just six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already established a scheme to reimburse all costs of social services for EU citizens working in their area.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, the UK and EU negotiations continued, leading to a referendum in the autumn of this year.
But the UK government is already preparing for the possibility of a lack of meaningful dialogue.
I know that this will be a difficult time for you.
So I would like to say now that I respect everyone's work, regardless of where they come from.
You, colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring in a wealth of knowledge that will strengthen and improve the health sector, benefiting both the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your country and we want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie Emergency Treatment After a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers coach Christion Abercrombie was the first to be replaced after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He went off the side of the road and hit himself", Reed said.
The coaches and health care providers gave Abercrombie a breathing tube and took him in for a thorough examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had just returned from a surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was "no definitive evidence of the nature and extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine the time of the injury.
Abercrombie, a sophomore football player, was playing for Tennessee State for the first time after being drafted out of Illinois.
He had five games on Saturday before he left, bringing his team to a total of 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes when they buy goods in the UK
Foreign buyers would be subject to higher taxes on purchases in the UK and additional funding would help the homeless under the Tory scheme.
This would undermine Corbyn's ability to influence young voters.
This paper tax will be levied on non-taxpayers in the UK
The Fund hopes to raise up to £120 a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes on goods they buy in the UK - an additional cost that will help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's power to bribe young voters who promise affordable housing and fairness for the rich.
The paper tax will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional funds will help the Government work to reduce the problem of homelessness.
This tax - a tax on top of the old tax, plus a higher one added two years ago on second homes and rents - can be as much as 3 percent.
The Treasury expects to earn up to £120 million a year.
Up to 13 percent of London's properties are not owned by UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for potential buyers to become homeowners.
Many of the world's most affluent areas have become "city centers" because of the long-term presence of foreign buyers.
The new legislation comes just three weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help teenagers buy homes.
He argued that developers were driving up house prices by owning land without using it, and he and May called for a ban on affordable housing to reduce the "disgrace of homelessness" in Britain".
Corbyn gave a good account of the reforms, including tax reform and the end of "zero-tolerance" evictions.
He also promised to give local governments the authority to build new homes.
"This year I said that I would devote my leadership to restoring the British dream - to a better future for all generations", said May.
This means fixing our messy housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live there.
However, it would not be good enough to make it as easy for non-UK residents, as well as foreign companies, to invest in the same way as British immigrants do.
For many, the dream of home ownership is a distant one, and the stigma of homelessness is growing".
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that his "greatest hope" would be to manage Scotland for a while.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach was eager to coach a team from the North-East, which was in third place in League One, three points off the top of the table.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after returning to St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"My dream was to play for my country as a midfielder.
I had a B helmet and it was all over", Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my father, and that was one thing that kept me going.
Still, the opportunity may come if I can manage to lead the group well".
Ross's successors included Sunderland managers Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow the big names in the league, having turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My current performance will be judged by the question Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure of the club, the fact that the club is in the Premier League", he said.
"It is not an easy task to get this crowd there, but I will feel successful when I have done so".
Ross spent three years in management, followed by a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as Hearts coach.
He also helped Alloa from bottom to No. 3, and helped St Mirren from near collapse to Championship victory the following season.
Ross also said that he was feeling better now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a time of hard work", he recalled, when he started the Alloa group.
"I know that I should be a manager, more than I am a football player.
It sounds amazing because I've done it right, I've made it a good environment, I've felt good when I was in the air.
But playing can be challenging at times.
There are things you need to do each week.
I still struggle with the stress and pressure of my job, but the direction is clear.
I've always wanted to be a leader, and the way I'm leading now sounds like the best thing I've ever heard in my entire life".

The best time to drink this paint is Saturday and 5:30 p.m., according to research
The summer heat has made British farms more efficient than the traditional farms.
Sales of the pigeon rose 2.7 percent in July - but the situation was worse in the developed world where sales fell 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for the CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continuing heat and turnout of the World Cup in England means that July followed the same pattern as June, when the prices were up 2.8 percent, except for a drop in the number of stadiums.
The 1.8 percent drop in June's food market worsened in July.
All the bars have been successful in imitating the restaurants.
Our food supply has also declined, but not to the point of declining to the level of our food stores.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of beer rose 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales fell 3 percent".
"The patterns show the same patterns seen from the end of April", says Paul Newman of the RSM Institute for Health Care Research.
The weather and the many sporting events and gatherings that took place contributed greatly to the increase in sales of the home markets.
It is almost a miracle that the booming markets have kept up the decline, even though a decline of 4.8 percent year-on-year will only add to the deteriorating prices.
The heat wave of summer can't come at a time as difficult for the food industry and only time will tell if the cooler weather we have in August will make the business more profitable".
Sales growth in the food and beverage industry, including new business, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new products.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a UK-based market research organisation, compiles market research from 47 groups in the industry, which together are worth up to £9 billion, and is a leading example of this type of industry.
One in five children has a hidden personal account with their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have had a meaningful conversation with their parents and teachers, the study revealed.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in "fake instagram" pages
This article has raised concerns that the content on these pages may be obscene
20 percent of students said they had a large account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - set up a private account that is kept secret from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in "fake instagram" pages - referring to the instagram photo-sharing app.
This has caused me to worry that the content on these pages may be obscene.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a large, clean account that they could show their parents, and they had a number of side accounts.
One parent who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's private account found that she was pressuring her friends to "force me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of those children reported having separate accounts.
"Unfortunately", says Mike Buchanan, chief executive of HMC, "teens are being tempted to create online communities that their parents and teachers cannot see".
Eilidh Doyle to be "voice of the athletes" in Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most decorated athletes and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for the sport's governing body to benefit from the vast experience she has amassed around the world over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in Scottish sport, the UK and worldwide by the racing community and we hope that racing in Scotland has benefited greatly from bringing him on board", said Beattie.
"I am ready to be the voice of the sport and I hope to add to the influence and help to lead the sport in Scotland", said Doyle.
The American sprinter, Olympic gold medalist in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games and a BBC correspondent, was left paralyzed after suffering a stroke.
"It has been a month since I had a stroke", he wrote on Twitter.
I could hardly walk.
He said to his fellow-practitioners, "I will soon recover.
I have learned to walk again, and now I am a gymnast.
Thank you so much for the encouraging words!"
An advertisement for a milk thresher that compared the brothers to cows caused a rift on the Internet
A dairy company caused a stir online when it compared women to dairy cows.
In the opening of what has been described as "the world's first milk-filled suit", the technology company Elvie is producing a special music video ad that shows the freedom that a milk-filled suit gives to breastfeeding women.
Four women are shown kissing a basket of cow's milk to a song that says: "Yes, I'm sucking milk, but you can't see the tail" and "if you don't look, this is not cow's milk, it's human milk".
The song continues: "Woe, woe, I will feed the sons, woe, woe, I will nurse my young women".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked an online war.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reviews, many saying it downplays the "bad" aspects of the dairy industry.
"It is a terrible thing to use cattle to promote this instrument.
Someone wrote that they, like us, conceive and bear children, only to be adopted shortly after birth.
Elvie's milk thinner fits comfortably into the breast of the nursing mother (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It seems to be a confusion for both mother and child.
But why not use it to promote the baby-sitter formula?"
Another added: "Publishing from the road".
Others also supported the ad, and one woman described the song as "sounding good".
"I think this is a good job.
I too would like to have something if I were to be able to do it.
The milk press made me feel like a cow.
This is a difficult advertisement, but I'll take it from there.
It is a clever device", wrote one.
Another commented: "The advertising is aimed at women who are breastfeeding (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "cows".
It does not promote gratitude or condemn the milk business".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they are all lying down to drink milk in their lap.
The ad's message is based on the claim that many dairy mothers feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is silent, has no wires or no nozzles and sits inside a leaf, allowing women to walk, hold their babies and move around while suckling milk.
"The Elvie Pump is so powerful that it requires a lot of energy to start", says Ana Balarin, an ECD at Mother.
By imitating the nursing mothers we wanted to expose the fragility of breast milk and its problems, while showing in a humorous and vivid way the richness of freedom that the new device will bring.
This is the first time the Elvie pump has been featured in the story.
In the London Fashion Week article, a mother of two appeared at a fashion show of Marta Jakubowski using the device.
Hundreds of Child Smugglers Silently Trapped in a Texas Border Tent Camp
The number of children being trafficked has risen despite the fact that border crossings have remained stable for more than a month, largely due to the harsh restrictions imposed by the Trump administration and the tightening of child support restrictions.
In fact, many advocates also have people who entered the country illegally, fearing that they too would be deported if they came forward to offer help to any child.
The situation reached a peak in June, when authorities ordered that suppliers of medical care and other family members should bring their fingerprints, and other personal information, to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency is counting the number of volunteers who help orphans.
The Panmunja report states that 70 percent of those arrested were never convicted of a previous crime.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are in care or are in care homes are illegal immigrants, many of them fleeing from their countries of origin.
So we are continuing to investigate these people", said Albence.
In an effort to speed up the case, the authorities issued orders that some of these children appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of the usual 60 days, according to camp officials.
Many will be seen via videoconferencing, so that they can defend their immigration cases before a judge.
Those who are found unworthy will be readmitted quickly.
The children's being held in a trance, will cause them anxiety and emotional distress, which can lead to violence and attempts to escape, according to the camp's staff and the streets brought into the facility months ago.
Child advocates say that this concern is growing in large areas such as Tornillo, where signs of child abuse are often overlooked, because of the size of the area.
He added that sending children to the campsite without adequate training and social contact may exacerbate the abuse.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the war now entering its eighth year.
Moualem, who was then acting as Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were in his territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be dealt with accordingly".
"Let them go without delay", he told the council.
Moualem stresses that "the war on terror is at an end" in Syria, where at least 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and many more have been displaced.
He warned that Damascus would continue "to fight this holy war until we are out of the borders of Syria" and that all the groups would be "in attendance from other countries".
The United States has up to 2,000 troops in Syria, providing training and advice to Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad's rule.
France has deployed up to 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the world was too safe for them to return and complained about "some eastern countries" for "spreading fear among the people" that made refugees afraid to return.
"We appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with the return", he said.
"They were incorporating political language into a purely utilitarian narrative".
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that no reconstruction aid will be provided until there is a peaceful resolution between Assad and his allies to end the conflict.
UN officials said that the agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a military base in the heavily-developed Idlib region offered hope for further talks.
Russian-Turkish negotiations have prevented a Russian-backed Syrian invasion of the province, which has a population of about 1 million.
But Moualem said the agreement had "definite deadlines" and expressed hope that the military operation would be a victory for the jihadists, including the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, "which will never be completed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a constitution that would apply after the end of the war in Syria and allow for elections.
Moualem offered the following conditions to the Syrian government for membership, saying that the work of the committee "reviewed the text of the existing national document", and warned that no one would compare the work.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
According to this report, Trump could win reelection in 2020 if, as many liberals hope, his removal from office by a coup would quickly end his reign.
In what was to become "the most devastating speech of the end of human rule!"
For now, there will be no signs of weakness in the viewer.
Since 2014, the average watch time has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed that number to 3.5 million on the daytime newscasts.
"This is a fire that people are afraid of because it's one of the things we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's game show "Designated Survivor", about the secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, writer and performer of the comedy "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Facts About Joining the Boys Club of Hollywood", had another story.
He recalled a drive through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver of the car told her that he would vote for Trump.
What will it be? he asked.
"She said, 'Because they make me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is fun in the yard.
In fact, unlike other television programs, the headlines from Washington can determine the purpose of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the purpose of the global economy.
This program is one of the best that only a few lucky people can afford to watch
However, it is more than a matter of getting the world to know you when you find yourself in the sixth season of a panel discussion about the use of Bob Woodward's "secret" search for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("a stiff and proud jacket", the Washington Post reported) and the potential influence of Stormy Daniels's commentary on Trump's designs.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"The part of his act that makes it look like a reality show is eating something every day", said Brent Montgomery, a leader in the Trump program and the changing nature of the day-to-day (controversy with the N.F.L., to be precise Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford not to watch it for a day, and you will be left behind.
When I arrived at Fleiss' home this week, it was early in the morning and 80 degrees outside her home on the south side of Kauai, but she was locked in watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't even smile, not at a time when Brett Kavanaugh was scheduled to meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's fate seemed on the line.
"I remember when we were doing programs like this in the old days and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of the Eastern boom,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true".
Amy Chozick, a business, political, and media columnist for the Times, writes a weekly column called "Chasing Hillary".
Foreign currency is plunged into the House race for the tough midterm elections.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is the most expensive in the state, thanks in part to a change in congressional districts where two candidates have run for the same seat.
The newly incorporated Pittsburgh area is currently being contested by Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another city in a special election last week.
Lamb was the running mate of another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is in conflict with the 17th district.
The new maps were produced after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old cities had been demarcated in violation of the law in favor of the Republican Party.
The 17th Congressional District is a major campaign finance competition between the major parties in the economy, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after Lamb won a special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the city by 20 points.
The media has given the Democrats a lot of power and influence.
U.S. Examines Sanctions on El Salvador for Supporting China After Withdrawing
The Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing's authority, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a successful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until his colleagues expelled the Trump administration.
The State Department has decided to recall U.S. ambassadors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest round of attacks on Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalty was focused on El Salvador, which received up to $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including proceeds from drug trafficking, development and business support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in aid and a ban on transit, would be more severe in a Central American country with high unemployment and high suicide rates.
While the talks are ongoing, officials from North and Central America have postponed a series of security and economic meetings in the wake of a similar one last year that was seen as a new step in trying to protect immigrants from the United States.
But by mid - September, officials announced that they wanted the convention to last, effectively ending all the sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, which will be held in the middle of the summer, at the headquarters of the import department, officials said.
Three American envoys also returned safely to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any further strong news or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the details of the talks presented by three senior US officials, including two who agreed to discuss the details on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were verified by an outside investigator close to the administration and they also offered to remain anonymous.
Learning From the Past
Another possible story to follow would be the attempts by Robert Mueller's prosecutors to seek Trump's impeachment, which has ample evidence on record.
Mueller was reportedly changing his investigation to look at whether Trump's electoral fraud was a Russian conspiracy to attack our election.
If Congress changes its policies, Trump will find himself guilty of the party, which will make him ready to go back to the electorate, or even stand up for his colleagues.
The uncertainty is high, and I don't think Trump's downfall will happen - or that of his European counterparts.
There are consequences for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that could affect the outcome of the war.
In the summer of 1938, German officials prepared to try to overthrow the dictator Hitler, as the East had done with the help of Czechoslovakia in Munich.
Failing that, we lost the opportunity to prevent the next generation of deaths.
History revolves around this change, and the unchanging history of free speech is either being shortened or challenged.
America is now in the midst of a period of great change.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is the target of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since the paper was published, this year, when he proposed to begin recording secret presidential conversations and speaking out against the government's presence in office.
Rosenstein said that The Times was not correct.
"What if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete and unfair - or if it is allowed to proceed to the Supreme Court despite the suspicion of rape and dishonesty?
And most importantly, will we vote in a midterm election for Congress that will hold Trump accountable for his actions?
If we fail our test, our freedom of speech will be in jeopardy for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who had been deported to Auschwitz by the very Nazi regime that at one time occupied my embassy.
They survived, came to America, and 60 years later, I was sent to light the Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika cross.
But after all this, how can I be hopeless about our goal?"

Rangers forward Graham Dorrans is a bright prospect ahead of Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria, a hard-fought series against Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to be eliminated from Group G of the Europa League.
A serious injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the first game of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he was hopeful that Rangers could use the success of this game as a springboard.
"It was a good time for us because Villarreal is a strong team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered this race hoping to get something out of it and we really have a shot.
If we had won the last one today, it would have been a good thing to have lost.
They did well in the first case and we did well in the second case and we are proud of them.
When we leave on Thursday, it will be another day with them in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they had good points in the game that was cancelled today, with a lot of people supporting us, I hope we will win very well.
Last year was a difficult one, with all the things that happened, my injury and the changes in our team, but now the team is looking good.
The crowd is beautiful and the boys are having a good time; the exercise is good.
I hope, we can move on now, putting the events of the last game behind us and be winners".
The women could not sleep for fear of retirement savings
Even if the respondents had a positive view of their preferences, few would talk to their family about it.
Up to half of the respondents in the National Survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said that they discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't want to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, deputy director of the National Insurance Institute.
That is just the beginning.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for yourself if they do not know what you need in advance.
Be willing to share in the ministry, for such discipline is rich in wisdom.
Involve your financial advisers: Your financial advisers can help you to find ways to pay the bills.
Your long-term care insurance may be covered by a well-known long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy that helps you pay for the cost or to cover yourself and your finances - if you have the money.
Work on your paperwork: Finish your legal battles when they come.
Keep a medical record so that you can appoint a trusted health-care professional to monitor your condition and to make sure that the doctors will follow your instructions if you are unable to speak.
Also, think about who is in charge of your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to set up a deposit and make sure that all debts are paid if you become weak.
Do not forget to include all the essentials: Imagine that your elderly parents are in a life-threatening situation and are being rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about their medical treatment and health problems?
Explain them in a written order so that you are prepared.
"Not because you stole the money, but because you know who the thieves are?" asked Martin.
"What kind of treatment?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare ahead of time".
A number of gunshot wounds in Ilfracombe
One man was shot several times with a rifle while walking home from a nightclub.
The man, in his 40s, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, with a gunshot wound to the chest, stomach and abdomen.
Police described the attack, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as "an emergency operation"
The man did not see who attacked him.
The wounds were not too bad. The police called for any witnesses to the case.
Earthquakes and waves in Indonesia
A total of 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Palu on Friday, officials said, with deaths expected to rise.
At the time of the disaster, the relief workers were unable to receive any regular reports from Donggala, a region north of Palu that was closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, up to 16,000 people drowned in the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located on the western tip of the narrow island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a 300-km (180-mile) stretch of coastline on the eastern coast of Sulawesi.
The area, which houses the provincial administrative offices, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala region.
Nickel mining is also rich in the province, but the mineral is abundant in the Morowali area, on the other side of Sulawesi.
The cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by several earthquakes and tsunami disasters in the past century, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The same wave hit the Donggala volcano in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here is a timeline of the major earthquakes and tsunami disasters in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered tsunami waves that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, mostly in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late October and early November.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and causes tsunami waves along the southern coast, killing at least 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Up to 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing waves up to 10 meters [10 ft] high that destroy dozens of villages and kill 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and concern as people commemorate the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No waves were reported at the time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapses.
2018: A magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia's most popular tourist destination, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many homes and left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Palin, the eldest, arrested for violence and oppression
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on a violent charge
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of assault, a combination of a hate crime and resisting arrest, according to a search warrant issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, when the girl who saw her tried to call the police, Palin finally grabbed her phone.
Palin is currently being held in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is also being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said that he was innocent, true, when questioned about this, the media reported.
Palin was charged with three Class A misdemeanours, which carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
I have also been charged with a Class B misdemeanour, punishable by one day in jail and a fine of up to $2,000.
This was not the first time Palin had been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police about the accident.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was found guilty of using violence, conspiracy to commit violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said that she had hit him in the face with a coffee.
Sarah Palin came under fire from veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violence to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
A total of 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 quake triggered waves that destroyed hundreds of homes.
Power lines and communications failures and deaths are expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the coast of central Sulawesi, a small island just east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media to show the extent of the destruction.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate on the riverbank in the city of Palu as waves hit the island.
Prosecutors in the court have called for a death sentence for a suspect in the NYC attack
Prosecutors in New York City had called for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City attack that killed eight people -- the most unprecedented trial in the country for a national case since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot truck to crash on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crushing pedestrians and cyclists during the summer months.
To carry out the death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight people "on the spot" and injured people "on the spot", according to a death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both cases carry the death penalty, according to the court order.
Within weeks of the accident, a jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with the aid of a machine gun, often used by prosecutors in non-criminal cases, and one count of vehicular manslaughter.
The attack required "preliminary planning and preparation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's behavior as "violent, ruthless and feminine".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused the pain, grief, and loss of family and friends including Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the guests were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York abolished capital punishment.
The accused at the time, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering drug dealers but his sentence was commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a New York state death sentence was carried out was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple later convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse for his actions in the months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was very sorry for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told prosecutors that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to court documents.
He also asked to have an ISIS flag placed in his hospital room, police said.
The man denies all 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, said that he was "not at all surprised" by the verdict.
"We think that the choice of a death sentence over a guilty plea and a life sentence will only increase the suffering of all involved", Paton said.
Saipov's lawyers first asked the prosecutors if they wanted the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be given the job of overseeing Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to 'gather the mob' today at a time of growing protest at the Tory rally.
A former Ukip leader said politicians 'must feel the sting' of Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs put himself at the forefront of the EU's negotiations.
The incumbent Conservative leader Peter Bone made the following statement in Birmingham that the UK would 'have left' by now if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reuniting her scattered faction is intensifying as pro-Remain Tories stage a special anti-Brexit protest in the city centre.
The senior leader is being urged to maintain his position amid attacks from the Brexit, Remain and EU bloc.
His allies said they were determined to reach a deal with Brussels at the risk of a drawdown - forcing both Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their own interests and 'the ghost'.
Bone told a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to 'get out of the Chequers'.
He said that Farage would be appointed as a member and would be assigned to liaise with Brussels.
'Those who were already in the business, would have left by now,' they said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will oppose Brexit but we must get out of the Chequers scheme.'
In his statement against the EU's position, he said: 'We did not fight a global war to be dominated.
We want to set our own standards as a nation.'
Bone denies that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that British opinion has changed and wants to stay is very false.'
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the meeting, telling reporters: 'My point is this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers system is unknown to most citizens, unacceptable to the opposition, unknown to our party and our spokesmen who take to the streets and try to shut us out of our constituencies.
Please turn on the Chequers and start listening.'
In a more positive tone to May, he said: 'Many prime ministers are slow to deliver on their promises.'
Farage told the politicians at the meeting that they should "feel angry" if they wanted to manipulate the 2016 referendum.
'This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and the politicians,' he said.
'They are trying to confuse the Brexit story and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow them to do that and be innocent'.'
In a speech to a seemingly happy crowd, he added: 'I want you to make the politicians who want to disrupt Brexit angry.
'We are uniting the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
On the other hand, the Remnant also traveled through Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of supporters of the Tories took up the Tories Against Brexit banner after the start of the rally this weekend.
A Labour Party official named Adonis was criticizing the Conservatives for the vaccine they had taken from the party's official website after the meeting had opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have the most powerful IT systems and technology in Canada and beyond, a borderless, free market without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'Confusion will prevail
Nothing has ever been better than a good Brexit,' he added.
"Warren was preparing to consider his presidential candidacy".
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat announced his future goals during a presidential debate in eastern Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, was running for re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 vice presidential nominee in Massachusetts.
He is one of the most talked about candidates to succeed Trump in 2020.
Saturday's meeting in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of the community using the hall since Trump took office.
One of those present asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, which means a woman in the top leadership,"
The defendant was arrested in the LSU Sims shooting case
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that one person has been arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department said they had arrested Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET in a report.
The video for Friday's broadcast has been removed, and people are invited to describe the person in the video.
Sims, 20, was found dead at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died from the wound", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde went to protect his friend and was abandoned by Simpson.
Simpson was asked to be found at the scene, armed, and admitted to killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and scored 10 goals in a career that lasted 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Formula One Championship: Lewis Hamilton holds the world title after a jury verdict gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear by the time Valtteri Bottas won the race over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's "decision" would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas started well enough to almost knock out Hamilton as he defended his lead on lap two and called Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel took a step back and left Hamilton to drive to the finish line, which should have been a mistake.
Mercedes came in behind and out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a collision that forced the Ferrari driver to pull out of the middle of the track after the second lap to defend on the third lap.
Max Verstappen started from the back and finished seventh at the end of lap one on his 21st birthday.
He then continued the long run of the race by grabbing his tires and trying to finish faster than Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He then came in on lap 44 but failed to improve on the pace on lap 8 when Raikkonen came in fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri had a great weekend and was the best person to let pass him.
The team has done very well with points 1 and 2", said Hamilton.
What Was the Door of the Flesh
President Donald Trump praised Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for insisting that she not distribute letters to Christine Blasey Ford suspecting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
In his speech to the West Virginia convention, the president did not mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he did say that the Senate's record shows that people are "violent and contemptuous and lying".
"One thing that could happen and one good thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, if you look at anger, you would see angry, violent, dismissive people and liars", he said.
"You look at the story that's being published and they're like, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I did not do it".
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, did you publish the article?
Remember his answer...did you take out the paper - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't take it".
Oh, wait a minute.
Did we get the report", he added, in a speech to the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July outlining any suspicions about Kavanaugh, and the report was released - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's suspicions, I did not publicize his story", Feinsntein told the committee, according to Hill Street.
I was asked to keep the matter confidential and I did as I was told.
But their refusal was not well understood by the authorities, who said during Saturday's meeting: "I know that was bad body language.
Maybe not, but that was the most abusive body language I've ever seen".
In a subsequent defense of the Supreme Court nominees, who were accused of sexual assault and three other women, the administration said the Democrats were using this as a pretext.
They are eager to seize power by any means possible.
Behold the violence, the contempt, the indifference to the wounded, the treading down of power and authority", the Median is quoted as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by the first team
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars claimed their first ever Elite League title on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 replay in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly scored two runs off Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored the equaliser before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard came in to draw the match against Dundee with two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's boys, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier extended the lead a few minutes later.
It was a busy opening period, with Sullivan putting his team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt scored a goal to tie Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead at halftime when he hit the second home run of the night in the bottom of the first inning.
The stadium crowd was gathering and Bouchard again came in with a score of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee a chance to take the lead for the first time in the second half and ensure victory for his side in the fifth and final round.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, were scheduled to play Milton Keynes on Friday.
A flight attendant dies to ensure the survival of hundreds of passengers
An Indonesian air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after he died trying to land a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
At least 800 people were killed and others were missing after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and raised waves.
The earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks, and many people are still trapped in rocks in the city of Palu.
But even as his companions fled for their lives, 21-year-old teacher Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workstation in the busy tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He sits down to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was en route to the airport, can take off safely.
He then jumped from the tower when he saw that it was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital afterward.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said that the flight saved many lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan Hospital in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the plane arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this", they added.
On the other hand, officials feared that the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster management department said that the transportation to the Donggala, Sigi and Boutong ports was blocked.
"The death toll is expected to rise because of the large number of bodies in the rocks", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the group.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] in height battered the tropical city of Palu on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carrying relief and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A carload of bodies is brought in every minute.
Fresh water was not available.
Small markets are crowded everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to the scene but we don't know where we're going to find them.
This is a serious threat, but it is likely to increase".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to end all the activities that are connected with the human rights violations.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims someone was lost after the plane crashed into a ditch
The airline that operates the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after initially saying all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the hijacked plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday evening that the whereabouts of one of the men on board were unknown.
The airline said it was working with local authorities and hospitals to try to locate the man.
The company did not respond immediately because of other factors, such as the man's age and nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the crew and the pilot after the plane crashed while attempting to land on Chuuk Island.
Seven people were hospitalized, company officials said on Friday.
The company said that six of the patients were hospitalized on Saturday, and all were in good health.
The cause of the crash and the circumstances surrounding it remain unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane had crashed into the water as it was heading for the runway.
Some witnesses said that the plane had lost its runway.
American aviator Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low.
"That was a wonderful thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes says that he and others managed to get to the exit during the crash while the plane was flying.
He said the passengers were screaming in confusion, and he also said he had a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, dock workers also helped rescue people by using a lifeboat to get them across before the ship sank 100 feet [30 m] into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered aircraft in the past 20 years.
A researcher estimates the average time a woman has a healthy pregnancy
Prosecutors on Saturday dropped a charge in the trial of a suspect in the 2014 arson of a Mississippi woman.
U.S. Attorney General Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a witness in the investigation.
He explained to the court how he used recorded phone calls to try to piece together the movements of 29-year-old criminal investigator Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the day of her death.
Rowlett claimed to have received location data from phone calls that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the day of his death as opposed to his original statement, the Clarion Ledger report said.
When evidence showed that Chambers had his cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford came to the door and denied that he had been in town that day.
When asked by federal prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that day, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville".
Another variant is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks before his death.
Phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted all text messages, phone numbers and messages on his phone.
"She cut him off from her life", Hale said.
The court is expected to begin deliberations on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected to have a jury trial the same day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Three hip-hop artists wanted to work on their songs with lyrics that could improve society.
High Breed, a band from Bristol, has said that hip-hop music is a departure from its original design to address social issues and good political messages.
The goal was to restore the system to its original state and make it a useful tool in solving the problems facing mankind.
Some artists such as the Fugees and Common have been given a UK revival by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A NY City landlord sued a husband and wife after they were fired over "racial discrimination" claims
A housekeeper in NY City sued a couple after being fired from their job after receiving a supposedly distant phone message from her mother complaining that she was "another person".
Both men deny the accusation of racial discrimination, citing the case as a "pursuit of profit".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to discover that her nanny, Giselle Maurice, was a fat person when she first arrived at work in 2016.
"AYEEEEEEEEE THE BLACK MAN", wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, it was sent to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing that Plasco-Flaxman had made a "process error", they fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their African-American nanny was too weak and expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid her daily wage and fired from Uber.
However, Mrs. Maurice sued the family for up to $350 a night for six months, which she signed off on, without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, that we don't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's biased".
Both husband and wife have also rejected the accusation that Muarice is racist, that it is wrong to fire her, for fear that they will lose their trust after making a mistake.
"My wife sent me things she shouldn't have.
He is not partial.
We are not racist", Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"Can you give your children to someone you have chosen even though you have denied them their right to choose?
Is your child a baby?
Think about it".
To compare the case to a "commercial extortion case", Plasco's wife had only two months to live, and she was "not well".
"How can you approach such a person?
This is a good thing to do", the accountant added.
As the trial progressed, the court filled the family with scandals, mocking their conduct and lack of civic wisdom.
Paddington publishers fear that readers will not be able to trust the narrator, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a first-time reader who is not accepted.
It is a good thing to know now what we know about the proper functioning of Paddington".
His father, who had worked as a BBC illustrator before being encouraged to write the children's book and the playful true story of the war, would be sad to find his efforts rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the author's death was "a big deal" after his death a year earlier.
Speaking of Paddington, who was described as "the richest sheep in our family", he added that his father was very proud of his work.
"He was a modest man, and he was not proud", she added.
"But because Paddington was one of his most famous characters, it was like having a child who did something great: you would be so proud even if you didn't do it.
I hope he saw the usefulness of Paddington in this way.
Although it was his own invention, he always gave credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I hid her on the phone
There her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors performed life-saving surgery.
"Nad kept texting me and telling me how bad it was", said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad saying that she was dying in just two minutes and I told her to come.
I did.
I said: "I love you, my dear Father.
I will be with you right away.
I will be with you.
The medication given to her by doctors to calm her heart gradually wore off and left her body.
He died once to take the lead and now perfected it.
I sat there, and I waited to see if this was so.
I could not cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I just needed to be encouraged".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other young people - who had no idea of the tragedy they were going through.
"No one knew", they said.
"I bent down to the ground, tears welling up all the way.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt this compassion for Nad.
That he wanted my affection and my praise.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women send suicide prevention cards to the bridges
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide worked hard to stop others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have started putting cards on the Welsh bridge with a message and a number to send if they need help.
My mother's son, Tyler Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to hear what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, had a son who was a fine cook and had a beautiful smile.
"Everyone knew her for her smile.
They always said that her smile was everywhere".
However, he retired before he died, having been in a very bad condition".
In 2014, my brother Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, found his older brother after committing suicide.
"I always worry that there might be a repeat of the story with her younger brother", says Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis designed the cards "to let people know that you can go and talk to someone, even a friend.
Don't try to be silent - you have to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, also lost her friend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He did not express any feelings of anxiety or pressure or anything", they said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was very busy on Christmas Day - when the children were unpacking their presents he would not raise his eyes to look at them or to look at anything".
She said that her death was a great loss, but she had to deal with it: "It's a big loss to the family.
It is a source of disruption.
But we must keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's motives are in doubt as the FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked - time-bound, limited research - maybe we could get some consensus", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "split" in the middle of a tough debate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation?
Their impatience is short-lived.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, then they will be very unlikely to have the person they want nominated to the highest court in this country.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators, asking them to support Kavanaugh, who served in the White House during the Bush presidency and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its secrets?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the next president, to submit a qualification report and be confirmed to the Supreme Court.
North Korean expatriates 'reduced' under Kim
The number of North Koreans entering South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Byeong-seug, who uses statistics from the South's unification ministry, said that there were 1,127 foreign visitors last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said this was due to the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the high fines imposed on traffickers if caught.
Pyongyang has not yet made any comments.
Many North Korean immigrants are granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of the refugees have crossed into China, which shares a large border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats these people as illegal immigrants without treating them as refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - often at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the immediate issue of denuclearization.
This followed an unprecedented meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they discussed the possibility of joint efforts to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the delay in the talks.
"Without any confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and in this situation there will be no effective means of disarmament", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "unfit" to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was "misled" and therefore ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during a Saturday discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I don't know how to stop thinking that even a woman has 'been there, done that'" Pelosi said in her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegation that he had a sexual relationship with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh expressed a strong sense of aggression, at times even shouting and yelling about his family and school years.
He also immediately criticized the Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against him were "fabricated and purely to damage their reputation" and were made by people angry about Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she was convinced that Kavanaugh's conviction made it clear that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, because he had shown a political dislike.
"I doubt they've been able to eliminate themselves with the words and the way they've been able to talk about Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was more forceful when asked if she considered removing Kavanaugh if he was approved, and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if they didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then they shouldn't be on the Supreme Court, they should be on the court they're on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh will now be appealing to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about Kavanaugh's decision on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she is supposed to be a conservative judge.
In his most convincing trial, Kavanaugh failed to answer questions about the interpretation of some Supreme Court decisions.
"It is time for the accuser, the opponent, to come to our court and hope that we will say, 'It is all right,'" Pelosi said.
Women too needed to be helped.
The uncertain prophecy of anger, months and months of wrath will come, and she cannot hold back.
"We cry every time we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I helped one woman when I was a local leader who said she cried because she was angry, but she made a point that whenever she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You must think I'm angry because I'm crying.
I am angry with you".
Then he went on his way.
And I thought that was cool".
Tears are seen as a one-sided expression of anger because they are misunderstood.
One of the best memories I have of my first job, in an office full of men, where I sat crying with a rage, was being pushed into the bathroom by an elderly lady - a harsh supervisor whom I had always feared - who carried me up the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", he said.
"They don't know I'm upset.
They think you're sad, but they're happy because they've got you".
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, served as a presidential appointee alongside Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Hart was kidnapped by another woman on the Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, Schroeder, in a fit of rage, began to think about what might prevent him from running for president himself.
"It was a poorly planned wedding", he told me 30 years later with a laugh.
"There were seven brothers who were married to each other.
One person compared it to the story "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was so close, they were underfunded, and they promised not to stand for election unless they could raise $2 million.
It was a fierce battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the men received only $250.
"Do they think I'm being too generous?" he thought.
When she publicly announced her campaign, she was overwhelmed by a mix of emotions - praise for her supporters, anger at the work that reinforced the message of money and justice over justice, and anger at the stigma of being a woman - that had brought her down.
"You would think that my body would probably be destroyed", recalls Schroeder of the media coverage.
"You could say that Kleenex is my support.
I remember thinking about what they would put on my lapel.
"Did they cry?""
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial tensions in the US-China trade war are high, and while the conflict is still far from over, the proposed trade deal between the two countries could be economically beneficial to Beijing in the future, the spokesperson said.
US President Donald Trump was the first to announce the imposition of tariffs on all Chinese goods, including solar panels, metals and steel.
The biggest increase this week was in tariffs on goods worth up to $200 billion (£150 billion), collecting half of all imports into the US from China.
Beijing has reversed course by imposing a 5 to 10 percent tariff on up to $60 billion in goods.
China has promised to do whatever it wants with the US, and the world's second largest economy will never be able to replace it.
To make Washington swell is to yield to the will of others, but to bow to the US would be the greatest insult to Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts suggest that if Beijing is to keep things under control, the US trade war could benefit China in the long run by reducing the economic dependence on the two countries.
"The fact that the election is so early for either Washington or Beijing could create a kind of trade war between the two countries that is more dangerous than ever", said Abigail Grace, a senior Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready to accept refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria has said it is ready to accept the return of unwilling refugees and is calling for efforts to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"The country's current social and economic situation is a result of the efforts made to prevent crime", he said.
The government continues to restore the lands that were destroyed by terrorism to their former glory.
All the circumstances are in place to allow those who wish to return to return to the country from which they left because of the violent attacks and social problems that have affected their lives and their livestock.
The UN estimates that up to 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country needed help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would welcome any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But they insist that they will not accept any help that will be available in the following verses for help from developing countries.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US national team has now made six consecutive European appearances and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
The European team won when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's squad reached the 14.5 tons needed to defeat the U.S. squad.
US professional Phil Mickelson, the defending champion, conceded his tee-shot in the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been a dominant player in all competitions, becoming one of only four players to reach a perfect 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World-class boxer Dustin Johnson lost 2 games to 1 to England's Ian Poulter in what was to be his final Ryder Cup match.
One of eight Ryder Cup players, Sergio Garcia of Spain became the European record holder with 25.5 points.
"I've cried so much, and today I can't stand it.
This has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for taking me in and believing in me.
I am very happy to replace the cup.
All the credit goes to the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, who was overjoyed after the European victory.
He was giving strength to his friend John Ram who defeated US golf champion Tiger Woods 2-1 in a one-on-one match on Sunday.
"The proudest thing I feel, beating Tiger Woods, is that I grew up watching that guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has missed all four of his games in France and currently has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
A difficult schedule for a world-renowned champion, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA battled for a spot all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had the best performances of any team in the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furyk said after his team's humiliating performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was early one morning when we were the biggest threat to Europeans.
We went upstairs.
A tribute to Thomas.
He is a powerful commander.
All 12 of his players are doing very well.
We're working on it, I'm working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're moving forward.
I love these 12 boys very much and am proud to be their captain.
Give appropriate commendation.
We are exhausted".
Red Tide: Lows in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
New data from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicate that there is a decline in Red Tide populations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, decreases in variation are being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - meaning that the numbers are decreasing.
The Red Tide flows 130 miles across the ocean from the southwest corner of Pinellas County south to Lee County.
The fields can be found about 10 miles from the Hillsborough County border, but they are smaller than they were this week.
Red Tide has also been seen in Pasco County.
The pinellas county primary outbreak was reported last week, the first outbreak was reported upstream in coastal Hillsborough County, the most abundant outbreak was reported in Manatee County, the coastal Sarasota County, the least abundant outbreak was reported in Charlotte County, the most abundant outbreak was reported in coastal or Lee County, and the fewest occurred in Collier County.
Bullying by mobs has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
No mass shootings were reported in Northwest Florida during the past week.
