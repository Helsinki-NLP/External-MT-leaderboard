White pawn to f3, black pawn to e6, white pawn to g4, black queen to h4 - check and checkmate! This is what we jokingly call in chess circles the  mat of the fool .
White: a turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: a pawn on a7 and b7, king on a8, fool on b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the a6 turn, after which black has only two options: to take the a6 turn or move their fool to any other square of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, white moves their pawn from b6 to b7 and offers check and mate. In the second situation, white takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
