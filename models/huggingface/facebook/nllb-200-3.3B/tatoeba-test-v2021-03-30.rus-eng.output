Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He opened the bottle.
We're already home.
You haven't returned those books yet?

Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It only makes it worse.

I don't have money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for your eyes.

Mary, are you in a good mood?
I corrected the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom did 20 push-ups.

You're two years younger than Tom.
We've identified them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.

Tom should've told Mary.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.

You should come home early, Bill.
She was sitting in a chair reading a magazine.
From now on, no more crying.

I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting in my chair?
Sounds easy.
I can't afford to buy that.

Put it on the shelf.
I thought you found someone else.
There's always a lot of traffic on this road.
You've fooled us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
There's no point in pretending that you're gonna make me believe that I believe something that you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.

Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed these cards to my friends.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer, you know.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me money and advice.

I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in what was considered by the Jews to be a terrible Galilean dialect of Aramaic instead of Hebrew, thus showing the absurdity of claims that there was any sacred language whose use in prayer brought one especially close to God.

Stop singing

What do you think?

I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do this right now.
The robber entered the house through this door.
I know how to survive.

You'll be safe there.

Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do that again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you get her to do that?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best to keep it that way.
Would you buy one?
Tom will miss his plane.
She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the back of the auditorium.
You will survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman president?
He came hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did that.
I would buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.

Tell me why you're here.

Tell Tom to keep a low profile.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I'm tired, I'm working from morning to night.
What time are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going to happen to Tom?
I hope you're not catching a cold.
He's got a bird in his sights.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, my God!
I have to keep going.
She pressed her nose against the glass.
In English, there is no difference between the verbs ser and estar.
I know exactly what I have to do.
He's very secretive.
Your English is excellent.

I want to go back to that house.
How many pens do you have?
The pitch of the forge was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Tom to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to feel that he has to explain himself to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We're having some guests tonight.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time is the cure.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the chance.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some of the birds didn't fly.
What more do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you?
I told Tom that you came to Australia.
You were looking for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where should I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What do you got?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught in a blizzard.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What have we got to lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Did Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would have wanted us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that Mary doesn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had on him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
How's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not going to introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I'll always love you.
She said she was willing to do it.
She cried.
I told Tom that Mary had to do that.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living in the country?
How long did it take you?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm the manager of Tom.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was shouting.
Which one is better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I'm not the one who told Tom to go.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at 3:30.
I know you're hiding something.

Give me a cigarette, please.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this movie.

Have you told Tom?
I did!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've worked out a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.

It's ten o'clock, my mother must be angry.
White bread, please.

No one knew why.

Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it'll snow at Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from a friend.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like to have a coffee.
No one asked him.

I wasn't sure where to start.
That's a memory!

I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.

He dictated some letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?

He likes to tend the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about a hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since 2:30.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew that Mary was unhappy.

I'm ready to go?
I've been waiting for you.
I still can't see straight.
Run, you chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The net is huge.
You're getting to me!
I think we should pay more attention to the way things are now.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until after two in the morning.
Mary did not feel thirsty.
Tom didn't have as much trouble falling asleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about this, please.
As you know, we were late because of the heavy rain.
She seems to be in good health.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Watch out for your little brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to end.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturdays?
I put milk in the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There are no invincibles.

I don't understand what you're saying.
I know that Tom can draw.

I didn't know it was impossible.
You having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you measure it?

What do you got?
Tomorrow, weather permitting, we will climb to the top of the mountain.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complex it seemed.
His gray eyes were glistening and sparkling, and his usually pale face was alive and blushed.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Have some more.
I'm looking for my passport. Have you seen it?
His hands were grey with the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
I'm having a hard time solving this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Can anyone here speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I don't know how to dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Tom is in charge.
I learned to practice and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's gonna accuse you.
I'm not busy at all right now.
Children like to play more than they like to learn.
He was mistaken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary is in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of the fight.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's move!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom isn't used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, are mustaches suddenly a thing?
Tom said he wouldn't want to waste so much time on this.
You are upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom is wearing a pirate's costume.
That's the truth!
Let's get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
My work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes that Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of there.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald the Blue Tooth, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened to you.
It's been a hot couple of days.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Tom never saw Mary after that.
You can't go in that room.
You had other plans?
Who could blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hesse.
To tell you the truth, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases go to trial, it is customary for a jury to consist of twelve people.

Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized that something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
Another day has passed.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He hurt himself when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, hurry up! We're going to be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is world famous for its hamburgers.
Tom gave Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinions?
Do you like this perfume?
The lock is broken.
A diamond is a precious stone.
Have some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's going to be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice was confronted with, waiting for an answer, was a sudden war, a loud noise so sharp as to tear her eardrums, and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary carry things to the car.
You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
What goes around comes around.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana bread?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Well, isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed up the tree.
The language I'm learning is very complex.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has been in power for four years.
I'm glad you are.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have on you?
Could you solve that question?
Tom and Mary are both here.
Why would Tom do that?
In a building of 20 floors.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
Do you happen to know when Tom is coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you hold on a second?
Will you give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not firing him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'm going to be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind came up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try skydiving.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time are you planning on being home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as a mule.
I think you're a man to be reckoned with.
She knew she was wrong.
This is so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom talked in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl answered the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with the children.
How are the negotiations going?
He prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom has small moustaches.
Did you understand what she said?
You seem distracted.
Don't be mad at her.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place secure?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything is okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect that Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't go on the wrong side of the road.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're finished.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept to him; he always had enough to eat.
We need new curtains for the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
He looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her feet hurt.
That's a risk we can't afford to take.
I have something important to discuss with you.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you were jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't have to do this again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was kind to the animals, too.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Tom stepped away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't stop thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire him?
We cried together.
You want to try it again?
Just wait a little longer.
Why are you so naked?
You can make butter, cheese, and many other things out of milk.
You don't have the authority.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, remember those who dug the well.
Did you know that Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, right?
You are drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary are John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Did you think about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a shot.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one was hungry but me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in an avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll take care of this.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the shop open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
That's a good spit.
I really liked this book.
You are important.
When ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she could stay over.
Tom didn't tell the policeman his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I had pain all over.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Is this gonna hurt?
The girl was wearing a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.

I doubt Tom is still angry.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What do you want to say to them?
We're taking her home.
You smell that burnt rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When is your father coming home?
I know.
Tom handed Mary a book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary aren't married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We are champions.
Tom is a mute.
Tom said that wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring a salad to the party.
Her hair is wet with sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.

I respect his views, even though I don't agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Calling after 9:00 is cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put him down.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using it, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
How long are you planning to stay?
We ate in a hurry and left right away.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You are stubborn.
Be careful not to drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal with soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The door was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day of school.
I'm dying to meet you.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?

Does she sing?
I have to go to the bathroom.

A good coach coaches this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was delayed because of heavy snow.

I told him I was wrong.
I am a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, right?
It should have been you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that water?
She doesn't think so.
Is that where you live?
What would you like to eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning to do that or not.
I'm going down.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
She learned to ride a bike last year.
Help us out here.
You don't have to thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are there on your street?
Ivory tusks are made of ivory.

Can I tell them about this?
She's been silent all day.

It's in her room.
I didn't think you'd be back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.

I thought we could do it.
My mother didn't want me to go alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
You know what you're doing, don't you?

I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There are plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing short of a miracle.
We're the same age.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is free.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
That's gonna have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's half my age.
Tom knows that what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a mild climate.
Check it again.
Don't judge Tom by his behavior.

I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom is watching.
The rain has stopped. We can open the windows again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom is lost.
I was about to leave when the phone rang.
I don't have to put up with this.
Always give way to the obstacle on the right.
We're being asked to take turns presenting ourselves.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
You still having trouble with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing like a hot bath to relax you.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melodic siren song to me.

You are so impatient.
You said you wanted this.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you have to do this a lot?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For the love of Christ, stop!
Nothing like a nice glass of beer after a long day's work.

Honey, I can explain.
You'll soon adjust to the country life.
Keep a bucket of water nearby.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.

This is the deepest river.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Could you close the window?
