Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried they look like muppets.
Some Assembly members were appalled by the proposal to change their title to CHUP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly to the 'Parliament of Wales'.
Members of the political spectrum are concerned that this could become a source of ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that the new name was "rhyme" with "top" and "bottom".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, this is definitely offensive.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the whole group is unhappy and has offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party has indicated that his group is not biased towards the name change, but notes that the new name PPP (in English  MWP) has a certain verbal resemblance to  Muppet.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to change the name, made the following statement: It is understood that the final decision on any descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are referred to will be made by the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found widespread support for the Assembly to be renamed the 'Parliament of Wales'.
As regards the position of its members, the Commission prefers 'Members of the Welsh Parliament', short for 'MPs', but the 'MPs' option has received the most support after public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternatives, but reaching a consensus will obviously be a headache for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of the bill for the change within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final say on what they'll be called when they get to debate the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the country's name, has said he will not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country's name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Day are ringing in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem.
"If you look at it from a historical perspective, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today, they're both gone.
Adams said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways", he adds.
The bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges where everyone gathers regularly.
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, and sooner or later they would be in the same situation.
The man adds that the churches could be replaced by apartment blocks where people live who do not help the survival of the other shrines in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not very likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.
Both churches were built by white herdsmen before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolis community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist flock was displaced in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin's was taken up by black Christians under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against the retailers on 125th Street, which is the main shopping street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939 the building was badly damaged by fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners devised a plan for its restoration, in which they commissioned the bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly calls them the "Poor Bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "invaluable historical instrument".
The expert in question, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world, which was used by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether mentioned that he never had a replacement since St. Martin's.
What has been going on at St. Martin's over the past few weeks has been a complex tale, woven by architects and builders, some brought in by secular church leaders, some by the Episcopal Diocese.
The vestry, which is the governing body of the pastoral body, consisting of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concerns that the diocese would be willing to pass on the vestry's expenses, even though it had no role in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while lobster hunting in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and he and a whole group of people went down to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought the kid had caught a lobster and got excited, then realized he was screaming "Bite me!"
He bit me!
Hamel said that when he got to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his clavicle had been torn.
"I've called on everyone to get out of the water because there's a shark!" adds Hamel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Radius Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It's not yet known what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
The authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Soumi in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them pose no threat to humans.
Sainsbury's is planning an offensive on the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's is standing up to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty stalls at its premises where customers will be served by dedicated assistants.
As part of a major offensive on the UK beauty market, which is estimated at Â£2.8 billion and continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods decline, the largest ever beauty stalls will be set up in 11 stores across the country, followed by similar stalls at more sites if the initiative is successful.
The investment in the decoration industry comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free shelf space recently taken up by televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its range of beauty products to 3,000, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, similar to the offerings in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique range of make-up so that most products can be used by vegans  something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing discount programs at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shifting focus on buying smaller quantities of food at convenient times each day means that supermarkets must do more to attract shoppers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would look more like department stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos facilities in hundreds of stores and has also opened Habitats facilities since it bought both chains two years ago  which the company claims has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to re-design its premises for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals had failed.
Sainsbury's made a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's supermarket premises.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 sites to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for Â£125 million three years ago.
Hence, they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, made the following statement: "We have transformed the look and feel of our decorative stands to improve the overall experience for our customers.
We've also invested in specific training for our colleagues to offer professional advice on the ground.
The range of brands we offer aims to meet every taste and every need in a captivating environment with a convenient location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for beauty products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby's refusal to sign an Â£11 million deal.
The Dragon's Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby dropped an Â£11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's brand of home appliances and accessories.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Wilby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones to boil after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth up to Â£1.5m mean she will no longer have time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, with rumors that it has doubled Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated to be worth Â£11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head to one of her holiday properties.
One of the sources shared the following: "Truly was definitely Holly's highest priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term commitment that would secure her future for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave has made everyone absolutely unprepared.
No one believed that this could happen on a Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlow headquarters that's full of products waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the host of This Morning, one of the UK's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a delay in the launch of the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby herself founded Truly with Capp in 2016, with Jones, 52, joining as the company's chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will also replace Anne McParlin as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We will not comment on his business dealings".
Tough negotiations leading to a "warming up"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from news channels for making a comment that some would consider "inappropriate for the president" and too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump back down so much?
Trump responded in his witty "journalistic" way.
I'm not giving up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as a "major step towards denuclearizing North Korea".
But negotiations to disarm the nuclear weapons are stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal response" from the United States to its country's first steps on the path to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things in his speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are excellent", he noted.
We were headed for war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship.
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - the cessation of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return home of the bodies of American servicemen.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiating with Kim.
"It's incredibly easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we'd have about 200 people right there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island and kill hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
'Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unequivocal view that international aid is not wanted, which makes things a bit challenging', says Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the country.
National disaster agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo said that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery effort.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country still remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life, despite a warning being issued.
Even under the best of conditions, transportation between Indonesia's many islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship recently stationed in Lombok to serve earthquake victims has been heading for Palu, but it will be at least three days before it can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's backward infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, investing heavily in roads and railways.
But the inadequate finances constantly plague his office as Joco is again headed to the polls next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with clubs, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge has brought a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Gerd Shackiri, about 27-28 yards from Chelsea's goal, as his team trailed 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot, then made a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flies over the penalty area and heads towards the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the captive Kepa Arisabalaga and became entangled in the net.
"I tried to get a good position to get the ball because players like Shaq are always looking for passes in front positions, so I just tried to buy myself as much time as possible for a good shot to the goal", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante drowning, I pushed my ball and I just shot without thinking much.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the 25th minute after a goal from their Belgian star Eden Azar.
The Blues striker passed with a five to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from midfield to half of Liverpool.
The blacksmiths exchange a quick double-throw in the center.
Then he fired a quick shot pass, which led to Azar's clean position in the penalty area.
Azar overtook the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm this Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be the Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, news agency spokesman Sotho Purvo Nugroho reported at a news conference.
The city of Palo, with a population of over 380,000, is littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was discovered this morning in Burkenhead, Merseyside.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds from Grayson Mewes on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for help from anyone in the area who saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something with their dashboard cameras, to contact us as they may have information vital to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found on private property.
This afternoon a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived at the scene and asked where she had been found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, with police saying they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but was notified by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man was speechless when he heard what had happened.
Residents have been told it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared, crying.
She keeps saying "this is so awful".
At 2pm, two police vans passed through the cordon, while another van was left outside.
There are police stationed in the cordon to monitor the block.
Anyone with information is asked to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memorial hit by rewriting history.
Its ban will be poetic justice for his near-Taliban destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's public described Mr Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said the following: "It was inevitable in the present debate about removing statues that the one of Oliver Cromwell to the Palace of Westminster should become a goal.
The economic wars of the English Civil Wars were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent performance of Cromwell by Sir William Hammo Thorncroft is a testament to the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps even more so in the 19th century than today, to be the defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, that was the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a distinctly recognizable figure who represented one side of the split that occurred.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Pig killer fatally wounds Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a barbecue in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to inject his pigs with vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Xinhin, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next stable open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the carriage with a bloody saddle.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig fatally attacked the farmer, reports the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and disfigured", said Cousin Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else while police gather evidence from the crime scene.
It was also reported that Yuan's family and the market management are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although they're rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man critically injured.
Ten years before that, a 650-pound pig had tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to chase him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not intent on hurting anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect, the man concludes.
The weakening Rosa will bring frequent, heavy rains to the southwestern United States.
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause torrential rains in northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.
Rosa is comprised of winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. Sunday morning eastern time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a single-shaped storm that is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture farther north into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the tropical moisture along with the approaching single-cloud will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local levels, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, including debris flows and possible desert landslides.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Lightning floods are possible in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely unwise to travel in a handful of deserts when tropical rains are imminent.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause dust to rise and gusty winds.
The approaching single-season will bring heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which will lead to small debris streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the rainy season.
Late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October could bring major temperature fluctuations in the U.S. As the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures expected to be in the 80's from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the thrilling spectacle of the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford - the woman who accused him of sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued, with networks cutting their regular rebroadcasts at the last minute on Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had drunk himself on her and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely adamant that nothing like this ever happened.
That's probably even more than the 20.4 million viewers Nielsen reported for Friday's testimony.
The company has counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No data were immediately available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has traditionally had difficulty measuring the number of people watching from their workplaces.
By comparison, we're talking about an audience the size of a football game or a Hollywood awards show.
Fox News Channel, whose anchors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen reports.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest has remained high since the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday captured him being whistled by protesters as he tried to catch an elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
During the whole harassment for several minutes he never even lifted his eyes off the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's representing the truth to the state?
You have the power, while many women are completely helpless, the attacks continued.
Flake replied that they had already left his office with a statement and before the elevator doors closed he announced that he would make an additional statement during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided close live coverage a few hours later as the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake has said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which is what the Democrats in opposition are pushing.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several Senators, Fleck made a decision.
His election was definitely significant, as it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political play" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" on Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her, previously published on the front page of the paper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Dame's game plan" for Brexit, suggesting that the UK's collection of customs duties for the EU and vice versa is "completely absurd".
Police arrest suspect Deacon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Deetion Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, with police reporting that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shooting of Wade.
His bail is set at $350,000, Advocate notifies.
The East Baton Rouge Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, listing the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Search Unit, the Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanks local law enforcement for "timely justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shocked and devastated" by Wade's death.
Wade said it's something that worries a man all the time.
A volcano spreads ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center has been observing multiple tremors and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Hoquimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to secede from Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed in by the gendarmerie, began to attack the peacekeepers with eggs and paint on dust, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, there were further clashes with the police, who resorted to their batons to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups shouted "We don't forget, we don't forgive" while those who declared themselves to preserve the country's integrity retorted with "Spain forever".
Local media reported that 14 people received medical treatment for minor injuries as a result of the protests.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region even a year after an October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist-minded Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted for independence, although turnout was low as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop a vote at polling stations in the region in a series of violent clashes.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to thwart a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has any hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now it looks like we're stuck, the man added.
Despite a narrow victory in the regional elections in December, pro-independence parties are struggling this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Pugh, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that it's getting more and more tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders arrested pending a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
He claims that "my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing from the Spanish government".
Londoners: Men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 PM UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings has announced that there has been damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's goal brought Livingston to a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Premier League rookie Livingston stunned Rangers, beating Steven Gerrard for only the second time in his first 18 games as manager of the Iberobos.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team tied for second in the standings with Hibernian.
Gerard's team went winless on foreign soil in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday faced leader Hearts, who trailed them by eight points in the standings.
But before that, Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston are now on a six-game losing streak in the Championship, and manager Holt has yet to taste the taste of defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the visitors.
Holt's team had to lead the score a long way before he scored, and his direct style of play made it extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried to get through the defense, but his shot went out of bounds, then Alan Lithgow shot past the barrel after Craig Halkett returned the ball head-on.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing they could seriously hamper the guests from static positions.
And that's how you got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining and drawing Menga, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
By this point, the Rangers had more control of the ball, but they faced the home team's impregnable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
Rangers goalie saved Scott Pittman's kickoff, and a head kick by Littlewood went through the door after another static for Livingston.
In the Livingston penalty area, the centers were rained down, but they were easily cleared, and the referee twice disregarded the guests' claims for the bribe - first after a one-on-one match between Halket and reserve Glen Middleton, and then again when there was doubt about a hand play.
"Fenomatically" by Livingston
Alassadaire Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great score for Livingston.
The team plays just superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and the line-up have remained largely unchanged since the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt has earned much praise for the way he has transformed the team since his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell under constant pressure.
Meanwhile, the Rangers have shown nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they've demonstrated some great things, but in this case, they were way below that standard.
They missed the last pass before the goal, only once they managed to crack the home defense. This loss should wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), we witnessed smiles and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to mend ties between NATO allies.
Friendship is cooling due to issues affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented the 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were still many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both the policies of Erdogan himself and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the rift caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist rests after collision with car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast part of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The accident comes a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a hit-and-run driver on Childers Street, located about a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said that their officers are working to identify the man, and will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot at the high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons reports.
The riot broke out at Long Lartine Prison in Worcester at around 0930 hours UK time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
To contain it, special officers from the "Tordano" unit have been called in, who will have to deal with eight prisoners, including the riot itself, confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured officers suffered minor facial injuries and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons issued the following statement: "Special trained personnel have been called in to handle the incident at Long Lartine Prison.
Six guards have been medically treated.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we make it very clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, with the possibility of their sentences being extended.
Long Lartine prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after an inmate was attacked, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also last October riot police were called to the prison to handle a riot in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flash flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dry areas may benefit)
It's rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but it's highly likely that it will happen early next week as the weakening Hurricane Rosa sweeps through the desert to the southwest, carrying with it the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already established flood watch posts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain likely to fall late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted on Twitter that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of precipitation possible in some places.
For those not threatened by flash floods, the pink rain can actually be a blessing, since the region is severely affected by drought.
Although flooding is an extremely serious concern, some rain will probably be helpful as the southwest is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second-worst category, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still boasts maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountered in cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and is therefore weakening.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"Summary rainfall is expected to be up to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possible up to 10 inches, "weather.com reports.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The primary risk from Rosa or its aftermath is extreme heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", warns the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and waste-carrying streams in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack, four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 0400 hours UK time on Saturday.
He's in a hospital where his condition remains stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are asking anyone who may have captured what happened to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the viciousness and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump declared at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh had "suffered the viciousness and wrath" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual assault decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the arraignment.
The president made a statement Saturday saying that today the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence, courage and virtue.
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation for public service", the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president was indirectly targeting Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the general election.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
"Although I am not a candidate, I am actually running", Trump continued.
That's why I'm running around and fighting for good candidates.
Trump noted that the Democrats have made it their mission to "interfere and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, casualty numbers rising
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were swept off the coast by giant waves when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday when the evening shore was swept by waves as high as six meters (18 feet), carrying many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami is coming after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, which resulted in many being victims of the disaster", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The water had swept away cars, trees, entire houses, and hit everything in its path", continued Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 meters per hour) before hitting the shore.
"Some people climbed trees and managed to escape the water", he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Secondary tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) has issued a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentioned that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
He also added that communications were completely cut off and there was no information from Donggala.
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already made their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get even more complicated.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting the tsunami that struck Palo, although officials explained that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media show a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about an impending tsunami.
In a few minutes, a huge wall of water hits the shore, sweeping away cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the video in time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages, which cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees are still desperate for food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has now risen to over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found shelter in the tarp shelters in the backyard of their office, they passed through a series of devastation scenes, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw countless houses destroyed.
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the rescue and recovery operations of emergency teams, some complain that foreign rescuers with extensive experience in similar situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, sending personnel and supplies from abroad can only start if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still regional", said Auliya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government declared it a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but that's why they haven't declared it yet".
As it falls over Palo for the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those still unaccounted for continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after news of the Roa-Roa Hotel collapse reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the runners in Palo who were participating in the beach festival.
Instead of a couple of blue marks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he added.
Thieves withdraw $26,750 during a cash-flow at a Newport, Va., ATM.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was loading an ATM in Newport on Levi's, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to load it with cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man approached running behind Brink's employee's back and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, the report continued, but police did not say how many were involved in the robbery.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for a while and has been using it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who has pulled out for emotional reasons, the show's creator has told us.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I believe that 'Yeah' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'", West shared earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from Kaniya, which means just one person, to just Ye  which is a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
The rapper is one of many celebrities in his field who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and nicknames, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the aliases Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's former collaborators, Jay Z, also introduced himself in a variant with or without hyphens and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico has sworn never to use the military against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador vowed "never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people as leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for AI development.
As China becomes more active on the AI front, the US should double its research budget in this area, argues AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various U.S. government departments made statements on the subject of AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be the number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling the AI development budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and have yet to make further breakthroughs in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could also double the chances of the next big breakthrough in AI coming from the United States, as Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "The AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies  Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie, Melanie Lee worked on an AI system that beat America's most successful hotel player, then became a CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee credits previous technology competitions of the federal government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be, which would help identify new visionaries.
"Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government funding", Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away the academic leaders, it's the corporations", the man claims.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
"I think that the AI science doctors should be automatically offered green cards", the man claims.
The US State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation AI in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they're currently investing over $100 million a year in AI development.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, had not seen any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which is blocking Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim against its territorial integrity and therefore vetoes its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Georgi Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, while a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the referendum will reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The question on the ballot is: Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the post-Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my voice for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they will abide by its outcome to the extent that the vote is already decisive.
To change the name of the country, it needs a two-thirds vote of the parliamentary representatives.
The state election commission has reported that as of 1 p.m., there have been no reports of irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gose Tannewski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small stage and lined up chairs in front of the tents set up by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held high, not through the servant door", Kavadarkov said.
Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as the unemployment in the country is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The Governor also said that the positive result will lead to "acknowledging the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a poll that showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required activity level.
Another poll, by Macedonian TV station Telma, revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote "Yes".
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would represent the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City goes through the whole of Brighton's defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the defence of Brighton and brought home a 2-0 victory to Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's play for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before sprinting the ball into the empty space forward.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left the rest behind at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he passed left to Sterling.
The English striker with a touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a right foot stroke overtook Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
Aguero is struggling with some leg injuries, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We planned for him to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
But it was Stirling who secured the Sky's first lead in this Premier League game.
He signed in the 29th minute.
In the goal situation Aguero got a pass deep into Brighton's half.
He immediately threw a pass to the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane went forward with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The Skyline's forward was able to get a close-up just before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the fate of the Rockies.
Since the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no particular point in another game for a starting pitcher.
And yet the ever-ambitious Scherzer hopes to be the starter Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the game matters for the Rockies, who lead by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies have secured at least a wild-card berth after a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but it's still not certain they'll win their first division title.
Although we're not fighting for anything ourselves, we want to finish the season with a good game in Denver, where the crowd and the other team will give their all to win maybe the most important game of the year for them.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it's speculated they'll allow Scherzer to pitch if the game is a tie.
For Scherzer, it would be his 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he had a practice session on Thursday and would have his normal off-season until Sunday.
The Washington right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is recruiting supporters in West Virginia.
President Koso hinted at the situation with his nominee for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the general election.
In November, everything we've accomplished will be at stake.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
"This is one of the greatest moments in modern history", he said, "and I also say that even though I'm not a candidate, I'm actually running, and that's why I'm fighting hard for the right candidates".
And then he went on to say, "You all see this terrible, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power by any means, you have seen their ruthlessness, their malice.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to get their grip on power and governance, because they're interested in power and governance, and we're not going to give them that.
The Democrats, in the words of the president, have set themselves the goal of "impeding and obstructing".
"What we've all seen over the last four days", he continued, calling the Democrats "angry, nasty, mean and unfaithful".
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud cheer from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting. That was a really bad sign. Maybe the worst I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer broad-minded.
The party does not tolerate those who speak openly
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I'm just the last Labour MP to have been told he wasn't welcome just because I was speaking out.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment for standing up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with under previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we wish the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most rallies and promises of "more soft and moderate" politics have long been forgotten, if ever they were on the agenda.
It was becoming increasingly clear that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion was judged on how much it pleased the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I had worked for before, who I thought shared similar political views, began to expect me to take a turn and take positions that I would never agree with - whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements - no matter what I'm actually saying - there's a whole outrageous barrage of social media calls for recall, rejection of moderate politics, claims that I don't belong to Labour.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I even got more luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me are at least mostly political in nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face sexist or racist subversion every day without being frightened by it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said Labour must embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer broad-based, and with every sign of mistrust or change in election rules it becomes increasingly narrow-minded.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last couple of years to keep my mouth shut, not talk so much, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government, which by its neglect led to the literal collapse of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country moves towards Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political expulsion will stop me from acting in the way I believe is best in your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Air led the way in the standings.
The two late essays may have slightly altered the final score, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Premier League match at Tennent.
The team is already leading the standings and the only team out of ten to go undefeated so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved crucial in a game that coach Peter Murcie and his team can be very pleased with.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the last few games, and we're still unbeaten", Murcie noted.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "Congratulations on Air, they really took advantage of their situation better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute ass, followed by a successful extra shot by Frazier Climo, took Ayr ahead in the score, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up in the score after Jason Baggott made an ass followed by an unsuccessful extra shot.
Climax increased the lead for Eyre from a penalty kick just before halftime, scoring an ass after a solo action, and then realizing the extra stroke, making it 17-5 for Eyre at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's shot followed by Baggott's successful extra shot cut the lead to just five points.
A long stoppage of play followed due to a serious injury to Ruad Nott, who was put on a stretcher, and after the match resumed Air increased their lead after an essay by Stafford McDowall and a successful extra stroke by Climo.
Then the acting Air Force Captain Blair MacPherson was given a yellow card and the Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by putting a strong push and an ass through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful extra stroke.
However, the hosts regained their presence and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Clima without a ball, from the subsequent penalty shootout, McPherson scored an ass with the forward line of the Air.
Climax made the extra shot, and soon did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught a kick from David Armstrong and took out winger Gregor Henry on the flank for the home side's fifth ass.
The star of Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kearnan seems to be heading into a more direct and warm industry after it was revealed that he was appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he also wrote and co-starred in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kearnan is already planning his life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he's a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kearnan was planning to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The Marines are constantly patrolling the rigged naval headquarters at La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying over the public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: "The sea is our rightful possession".
It's our duty to get it back.
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet given to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive  as is the call to sail across the Pacific again.
In fact, that hope is now strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"The strength is in Bolivia, there is a sense of vigour and unity everywhere, and the country is expecting a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will uphold Bolivia's claim and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is set to go to a contested re-election battle next year, also bet heavily on the court's verdict on Monday.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean", Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court ruling in favor of Bolivia is quite slim, and even if it did, it would not change the reality.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to take Chile's territory and has decided not to determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling is only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case is "not complex", responds Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually hurt it.
"The problem of access to the ocean was fueled by the current government of Bolivia", Zarate claims.
Then he suggested that Morales's militant rhetoric had wiped out what little goodwill remained in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point resume negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to have a normal dialogue.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions since 1962.
Former President Eduardo RodrÃ­guez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was being made unusually quickly.
He said that on Monday Bolivia would have the "incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of discord by achieving mutual benefits".
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - had used the issue of access to the ocean as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems".
North Korea says it will not proceed with nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go to nuclear disarmament first unless it is able to trust Washington.
Ri made his speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of re-launching deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri called it "empty hope" the idea that continuing sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is unwilling to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that it sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to set up a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show is unveiling the latest fashionable hat that will soon be in fashion stores near you.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block out the sun's rays, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which stunned the fashion scene during Paris Fashion Week.
I caused a wave of Instagram activity over the summer, with designers sending their eye-catching designs to stun the fashion community.
Valentino's signature piece was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide rim that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-decorated feathers, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple - but they're not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had lipstick stitches and were less reminiscent of high fashion than Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs looked like scuba gear in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a melted funicular ice cream.
If you are into fashion trends like this, you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the giant hats will soon be on sale in fashion stores near you.
The giant hats come just after the "La Bomba" straw hat with a two-foot perimeter that was seen on the heads of everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that has taken over social media has led to the emergence of another huge design on the fashion podium  a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearer wearing it in a swimsuit.
The burnt orange-colored raffle bag, with raffle eyelashes and a white leather handle, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer. After the designer has made such an impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for large-size accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a reputation for academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another excellent test performance, which was only reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Association (SCIS), strive to offer the best possible level of education to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said this: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, your words reach them.
But if you speak his language, you touch his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with the people of other countries.
From this year's test results, we can see that languages are at the top with the highest scores for independent schools.
A total of 68% of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a high A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of pupils achieved an A in Chinese, with the same score being achieved by 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are recognising foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice by pupils are treated the same as natural and mathematical subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) both in the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Work Skills Commission showed that 17% cited insufficient language skills as one of the reasons why employers have difficulty finding employees.
Therefore, the command of foreign languages is increasingly becoming a requirement to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require foreign language proficiency, making these skills essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you master a foreign language, you will have a real advantage in the future, since you will have a lifelong mastery of that skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person one step ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 UK adults in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language proficiency good enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language with a double-digit proficiency rate of 15%.
That's why investing in language learning today is important for children today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding good jobs.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be plenty of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are experts in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which requires that they be taken into account in the education system.
And really, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellence, to young people in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Association.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the fans who are thrilled to see LeBron James' first game against the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in the team's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play in the match.
"He'll be on the field between 1 and 48 minutes", Walton announced via the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James will likely play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After practice earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the new season", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned rallies for Trump, which include stops in familiar locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the confirmation vote for his election to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump aims to bolster the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in the November ballot.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below via the YouTube live stream.
Trump is likely to consider this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been strained over allegations of sexual misconduct, delaying the Senate confirmation vote for a week while an FBI investigation continues.
The main purpose of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans build momentum for the November election.
So the campaign of President Donald Trump has announced that these five rallies next week are aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so essential to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season filled with commitments", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA will fight to the end, keeping their hopes alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three straight, no-frills sessions, the Sunday afternoon games may have delivered what the Ryder Cup needed.
The shift of advantage in sports is a rather subjective concept, but one that players believe in unconditionally, especially in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They were leading by six points, and now it's only four, so I guess we've got a little bit of momentum", said Jordan Speight at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead with only 12 to go.
But as Speight says, the Americans still have a lot to show and their fans should not lose hope, judging by the form of Speight and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four possible points.
Spieth is showing great form from the start to the end of every hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheers from the fans grew as he advanced into the round, where he hit a precise home run to tie the score in the fourth game after he and Thomas were two strokes behind on the first two holes.
His shot, which won them the game on the 15th hole, was met with a strong reaction of enthusiasm, which leads us to believe that it really wasn't all lost for the American team.
"The important thing is to think of nothing else and focus on your own game", says Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to remember.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe, winning four out of four, and seemingly getting everything right.
They were the only couple in Hollywood who didn't do "gods" on Sunday afternoons, but they also didn't do "gods" on Saturday mornings, or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successive successes, and the way in which energy seemed to flow between them and the enthusiastic fans, solidified the view that they were the players who would win on Sunday and there would be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, who would bring Europe's potential victory as the sun set over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But the tales of European glory were a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly took on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning football games, while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
The gods and two doubles on the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in trouble they couldn't handle.
But on Sunday, there's no way someone else can solve your problems.
Football and soccer matches are extremely interesting to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can change at any given moment.
The Europeans were playing better as a team and so they had a significant lead before the last day, but this session of "four-game" matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last - something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup, having led the USA by 10-6 after playing the Fourball and Foursum matches on Saturday.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, which increased their assets in the Le Golf National by four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years earlier, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning fourball matches over the Americans, who made mistake after mistake, and eventually Europe won the series with 3 wins to 1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the Fourth World Games, where they won two matches, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first rookie from Europe to score four points in a row, and he and the Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood", after this sensational weekend became only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After unopposed beating Woods and Patrick Reid in the fourball matches, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambaugh with an even better score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, has only occasionally displayed flashes of genius, but so far has 19 losses from 29 games in the Fourball and FourSum games, plus a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who was given a break for the morning's fourball matches, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the foursome clashes in a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koppa, respectively world number one and number three.
But the European team failed to enjoy a perfectly pleasant, cool, cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas have restored hope for the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a hard-fought 2-1 win over Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the Fourball matches, and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the Fourball matches, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come within four points of a single-game deficit, and under the rules, Furyk's team will keep the trophy even in a tie.
However, after being beaten twice in a row, their chances of returning on Sunday seem to be slim.
North Korea says there's no way to unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened mistrust of the United States and there was no way the country could give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world body, Ri Yong-ho said that in the past year, "significant measures of goodwill" have been taken, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances will we be the first to unilaterally disarm".
While Ri expressed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures, his statement seemed meaningful because he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and Trump gave assurances on North Korea's security.
North Korea has been pushing for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the lifting of the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The US is insisting on "demolition of nuclear weapons first" and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through force, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust".
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missiles aimed at the US mainland were inevitable after angry President Trump called Kim a "suicide missile man".
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removed its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no deadline for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved.
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing culture of all-night caffeinated learning.
One teacher found that students at the world's top university often don't even think about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he talked about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, teaches students the most important lesson about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic achievement, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One part is a room in a dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes, and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
Another section tells participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that this isn't going to change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know just as you have a right to know the health effects of your choice to smoke, added Professor Keisler.
The culture of pride in studying all night is still there, he says, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Providing adequate and quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says, even in order to avoid fullness, since sleep deprivation puts the brain into a hunger mode that makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Keisler prepare the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says the course has "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be for all graduates to be asked to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competing institution.
Professor Keisler recommends that students consider setting a bedtime and wake-up alarm and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disturb circadian rhythms and lead to sleep problems.
Menga's goal crushed Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after a shot by Dolly Menga broke Stephen Gerrard's scoreless team and brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Iberrocks were looking to record their first win as a guest since a 4-1 February triumph over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side only suffered Gerard's second defeat in his 18th game as manager, which left his side eight points behind the disbanded Hearts, leading Ladbrokes in the Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers, who were lacking in constructive ideas, never looked close to a tie.
After the match, Rangers were relegated to sixth place, and Livingston were third, only one goal behind the second Hibernia.
There may be additional problems for Rangers, as the bench referee, Calum Spence, sustained a head injury after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the away fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livingston XI that pulled a point against Hearts last week, and he should be pleased with the way his aggressive team pared out all the other team's moves.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did better on the rare occasions when they had it.
They should have scored in the second minute when Menga took out Scott Pittman with a touchdown against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' centering from the foul found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow deflected the ball away from the back row.
The Rangers took control of the game, but they failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought he should have scored in the 15th minute when he faced Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only had two hits in the first half, but former Iberox goalkeeper Liam Kelly made it easy with Lasana Coulibaly's head and a weak shot from Ozio Ejaria.
Although Levy's shot in the 34th minute was surprising in terms of possession, it was totally deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' deep center.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who passed it in cold blood to Menga, who was easy to make.
Gerard responded to the break by swapping Coolidge for Ryan Kent, and that switch almost immediately resulted in a win when the wing passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to force the guests to play in a home-court style of play, with Lithgow and Halkett continually bouncing the forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with Jacobs' shot, and at the next corner, Lithgow shot his head across the beam.
Rangers' reserve inning man Glen Middleton demanded a foul at the end of the game after a one-on-one with Jacobs, but Thompson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Year: The inventor of the Geiger counter
A page from our Sunday Morning yearbook: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROWN... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science ever since, the Geiger counter became a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film "The Bells of the Coronado" starred the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What in God's name is this?
It's a Geiger counter and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms being released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
It's definitely blowing right now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to spot foreign cells.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to spot foreign cells and kill them.
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
Then they can see a protein that's common to many cancers and inject it back into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine, which trains her immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away in over 18 months.
The method involves harvesting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and training them to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat that read "Make America Great Again" on his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing a nonsensical performance praising US President Donald Trump and claiming he will run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the caption "Let's Make America Great Again", he went against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
I talk to white people a lot, and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America long ago, he said.
SNL kicked off the show with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a recording of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his post.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes with his hat.
I got interrupted backstage.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat".
I was harassed!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?" claiming he's going to put on a Superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
The comments prompted at least two applause from the audience, and members of the SNL crew appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of them telling: "The whole studio went silent".
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West stunned many with his rendition of "I Love It" dressed as a bottle of Perry.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU for finally making the crowd happy".
But the show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just beating himself up, and that's great.
But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their art) who I think is welcoming and spreading an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free to go.
"That's what we are", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to now officially known as Kenny West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Charged with attempted murder after a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
The star of Game of Thrones, Keith Harrington, is against toxic masculinity.
Keith Harington is best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the macho-hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on screen often leads young people to think they have to be "rough" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels "strongly" that this issue needs to be resolved.
"At the moment I am personally firmly convinced what we have gone wrong with masculinity", he said.
What are we teaching young men about the problem we see today?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to too many masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel they have to become this particular type of man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
Because obviously something is wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended the following summer, claiming that he was "done with the battlefields and the horses".
As of November, Keith will be starring in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in this way he gave me my future family and defined my life going forward", he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl that Keith's character John Snow falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spina bifida.
According to the country's health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health ministry said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet every year the number of people living with HIV and spina bifida in China is increasing by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the LGBT communities was widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with men eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of disease transmission are due to inadequate protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican Senators, denounces the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information on three Republican state senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and ultra-right-wing websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unidentified person at the Capitol during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office, and released information on a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
 The member of my team  whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims  is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie.
Waters's statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There is poison in this denial", wrote Fleischer.
That suggests she doesn't have the temperament of a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, you shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't be provocative.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Really, if it's true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office has referred the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team".
Johnny English's review is back with the lame spy parody with Rowan Atkinson.
It's now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British film, and it seems that this is also true for the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise about Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will self-deprecation and mimicry that speak of how obviously stupid we are become a new opportunity for the nation to export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes and face all twisted and humane has the permission to renew things for a second time. His name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comic creation intended for non-English speaking film fans.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering glamour, owns a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a lot of the man who contributed a note to the musical theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It was also originally based on the chaotic traveller and international man played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
There's a good moment or two in the last Johnny English movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor and for a moment the fins jammed in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather weak and oddly redundant, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible include a dose of comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and Johnny English's mad accidents are not innovative and focused in my opinion, since the lack of play of Actinson reminds me of Mr Bean.
The usual assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has hacked into Britain's top-secret network of spies and revealed the identities of all operatives on the terror watch - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a bloated and pompous figure and already suffering from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she must call in a retired agent, since all active agents have been compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher in a chic center, but who is illegally teaching classes on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is called to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his longtime former sidekick Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, married to a submarine commander, a fun role in which little of Vicky Pepperdine's talent is wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's Secret Service and face the fatal beauty Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Beau begin their odyssey of farces: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes real anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to explore the interior of Volta's house.
All the laughs are definitely taken from the previous film, but since they're so cute and wild, there's a lot more content here that's meant for kids.
It's a rather mediocre production.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: Couldn't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matched his talent?
Labour denies it is working on a plan to make the British work four days a week but get paid five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby British people work four weeks but are paid five.
The party claims it wants the bosses of the companies to provide the savings made by revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend but receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would fit the party's economic program and plans to shake the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day workweek was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a review of the policy will be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen right away, but the four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and into the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to have this idea, the Green Party promised a four-day work week during their general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration is not met with the approval of the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's policy, it is not being considered".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to unveil his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the faceless CEOs and the speculators in the utility companies.
The chancellor's shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not get their full stake, as the Labour government could impose holds on the basis of the found infringements.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and to set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private firms to employees, who can accumulate annual dividends of up to Â£500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk 60 minutes ago about whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could cause some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this allegation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, decisive and unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and to change that, it takes a damning indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it outright", Graham added, addressing Christine Blasi Ford.
And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help in reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive lineup and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together on the grand lawn of Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also get to know the true purpose of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or actions such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful is a "global citizen" 12 years before he reaches his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to get them to demand action or is it just another case of what's called "clictivizing" - people think they're doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters, who are pushing for a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and communications arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Food, a UK-based investor-developer partnership, Aligning Children to Reach Their Full Potential, which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition simply a historic note", said "The Power of Food" ambassador Tracy Ullman to the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the NGOs on its website asking "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"It's going to be a long and difficult road, and we're going to fail and fail again.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just a few of the performers at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use naval forces to block and impede energy exports  Secretary of the Interior
Washington could, if necessary, use its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zink revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claims that Russia's involvement in Syria  specifically, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said.
The official said there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the sea lanes are open and if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products don't reach the market", he said.
Zinc addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that presents itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace fuels", he said, while identifying Russia as "the number one pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting exports of liquefied gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is making Berlin a "hostage".
Moscow has stressed several times that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be looking seriously at running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm going to seriously consider running for president.
Warren expressed his judgment about President Donald Trump during the city council meeting, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A poll conducted on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator shouldn't run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted for this nomination.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic Party figures discussed in terms of potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision in January, The Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed the PTSD to Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the recording in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after he's returned is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the elephant in the room and said of his son and other war veterans, they come back a little changed, hardened, and they come back wondering if they're going to get the respect that they and their brothers in arms have given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, which is included in a report of domestic violence and illegal possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit challenging a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a goodwill petition in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims that her partner and the sons of his violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. attorneys assisting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have been home to large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined in the light of the facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle", the goodwill report said.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the report that a policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the American economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary manpower".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his July 11 policy message.
The refuge was never meant to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious ones - that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double as search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her sick son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance is bringing more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to salvage some of their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake are overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Dwy Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were taken to the Army Hospital in Palo, where patients are being treated outdoors due to the ongoing aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears as he recalls feeling the tremor in the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the collapsed wall, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then she went quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "disturbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump cited the paid publication of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US congressional elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, in which they equalize tariffs on imports between countries.
According to experts from the US and China, at the start of the trade war, tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has been harassing American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a commentary in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, is now doubling down on this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's long-established tradition of freedom of speech and the press by running a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstad.
"In contrast, at the newspaper booth down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited expression and you will not see a real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had avoided the offer to publish his article, although he did not specify who.
With the Kavanaugh pogrom, Republicans are pushing women voters away from the midterm elections, analysts warn.
With many high-profile Republicans backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warned there will be a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around the ceiling are extremely strong and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to proceed with a vote.
These things can't be turned back, Grant Raher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow or in November", Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November Comes!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasi Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be ruled out", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say the problem is serious; it's true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash might follow if Republicans insist on confirming the nomination.
"It's become a big mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it's about how Republicans are handling it and how they're treating it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe in the wake of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, with a slightly more lean toward the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent say they believe Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of intoxication when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while they were at a party during her time at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, is starting a venture that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "global domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the undertaking.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own online personal data repository or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, Spotify, which are accessible in any browser, and at the same time it's all of them at the same time.
The unique thing about online personal data storage is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal data authorization".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company invests resources, processes and the right skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change when all their business models are completely revamped overnight.
We don't ask their permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide energy for commerce and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a strong influence in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the Victorian priest during World War I
It's 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on September 29th, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was shot dead by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's work was awarded a medal.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin in very thick fog and under heavy artillery and machine gun fire.
He later attacked the line of fire and with "incredible bravery" led the squad forward before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wang, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something that I know I could never do, but it makes me humble.
He and his brother Dr. James Van laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wang said it was a great honor for him to participate in the parade and added that the true hero's worthiness is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people.
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you're waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and you can't actually witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six from the main map, and was to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6pm, just as Geogard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after building until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fan described the switching of the children's animated film on Twitter as "some sick joke".
"The government regulated that at 6 p.m. this content was not appropriate, so the program was replaced with a children's show", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in response to a question about the broadcast.
Peppa the pig, yeah.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they're working on scheduling the meetings to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem", Coker said.
But it's six in the morning on a Sunday, and there's no way to plan things so that here the event is on a Sunday, and there it's on a Monday.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was government.
I can promise you that next time, that won't happen.
We're sticking to five fights instead of six as we usually do, and we tried to give more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation.
Tom Daly felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been hospitalized for several months.
When he first appeared on Laverne Daily, he said he felt "less than everyone else" as he grew up, because it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys.
He said, "To this day, the feeling of being inferior and being different are actually the things that give me the energy and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he did it because he was happy to be able to live in the open without consequences and wanted to inspire hope in others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - it was a surprise.
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age", he said, "he competed in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later". He said, "It's hard to find anyone your age who has experienced such ups and downs".
They became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says his whole worldview has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't going to be next to me, Dad, or in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that moment, when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted that he wasn't invulnerable", he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I'd been dreaming of jumping in front of an Olympic crowd back home, and it was the greatest feeling", he said.
It also inspired his choice of the first song   Proud by Heather Small which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him shudder.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays from 11:15am, UK summer time.
The lost form Mickelson remains on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back to his old form if he doesn't want his record tied with a failure.
Mickelson, who is competing in the event for a record 12th time in two years, was left on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for the football and soccer matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a mainstay on the U.S. team again, the five-time major champion spent the day as a fan and practicing his long-range punches in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old, who was never among the top straight players even at the peak of his career, is not in the best shape for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long, uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong shot.
And if the field alone isn't disturbing enough, in Game 9 on Sunday, Mickelson will face the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teamed with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and are looking to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the 12th game of the singles, make a strong start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's confident in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's given so much last week and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing just two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just happened, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could end his career in the Ryder Cup, which never came close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence brings other benefits to the team that can't be measured in numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people, and he's a great guy for any team", he explained.
I think the younger players have had a lot of fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great lead may soon be melted
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the huge lead accumulated before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be erased.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but was almost overtaken in the final and barely managed to hold on to the victory by 141â2-131â2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but very hard", Bjorn said after the 2018 European team won by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, leading by 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history has to show me and everyone on this team that it's not over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try and win this trophy and that's what we have to stay focused on.
I've been saying all along that I'm thinking about the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.
Pleased with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never rush into the festivities.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on individual performances, and that's different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then you put your full potential as a golfer to the test.
That's the message we need to get to the players: You have to do your best tomorrow.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, because he has to give it all up.
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the only exceptions being Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these great reversals on the last day. He was part of the triumph of Brooklyn, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the miracle of Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, led his players on the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but it would be good to get the same good start you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the advantage goes from one direction to the other, these interim matches are played under tremendous pressure.
So we've formed our squad and we've distributed our guys as we please, to try and do the impossible tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose these players in this order because I think it gives us the best chance of success", Bjorn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany again postpones the launch of a new warship
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War-era battleships, but that won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand's new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
Understandably, they will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods  the newest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to home ports.
But the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships  that are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power overseas  will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of major "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of around 120 seamen  only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project  including for training of the crew  also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering â¬3.1 billion ($3.6 billion)  from the initial â¬2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy is actually running out of ships capable of carrying out missions.
The official said the problem has grown over time as old ships are decommissioned but no new ones are provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be incorporated into the fleet.
The National Trust is monitoring the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats as well as the brown arrowholes water nightingales at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the farm to track the bat's activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the bats, as well as the species they make.
A habitat map and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of grasslands, and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Britain as a whole have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelter and lead to habitat loss.
Populations may be at risk from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night-time hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only special bat reserve at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manor manager, David Thompson, says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have great ground for bats", he noted.
We have old buildings, very old trees and perfectly suitable habitat.
But there's a lot more to the bat that we don't know, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
It stresses the importance of bat checks before any property maintenance activities are undertaken, as the accidental destruction of a shelter can kill up to 400 female and young bats and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of our animal species, because we just don't know what's happening to their populations".
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations and his lawyers will sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people want to become famous using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, addressing his 142 million followers, a few hours after the claims were published, the 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the post as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
"What they said about me today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to be famous by using my name.
That's the way it is.
They want to build popularity behind my back, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they call "unacceptable publication of suspicions in the area of private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for moral damages in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident in question allegedly occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the accident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a "99% good boy", but in this case, he just gave in to the "1%".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of revenge" and was worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she wishes to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juventus for a fee of â¬100 million.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret having lost its carmakers
Britain will "regret forever" losing its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a delayed border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant  where the Auris and Avensis models are produced  produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, are saying they're closing their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the 'just in time' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for the custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there could be problems at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to replenish its inventory at the Darbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's 'chess' plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'precisely calibrated' to avoid these checks at the border.
"We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to be able to seize that opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Following the claims not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be suspended, but in the longer term it warns that the additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and will eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsualaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly worried: "I judge from my experience that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have laid out a precise and robust plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed by another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumours about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he was resigning.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him for Thursday.
Trump said he would have preferred not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There's no date for that yet, maybe this week, but given all the other stuff that's going on at the Supreme Court, I think it might be next week".
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would dispute that: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10th.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not because of dislike of the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he shared: "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior".
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has held more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We checked those statistics".
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often, and you've seen us doing it quite often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior to the assembled press.
The Health Minister addressed EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister for Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'The UK-EU negotiations on leaving continued in the summer, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contributions of every single employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable expertise and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's game, when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
He went to the sideline and somehow just passed out there, Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and taken to the locker room for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the nature/seriousness of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore on a college scholarship, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Under new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on UK property purchases, with the extra money going to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today the decision to increase the value of UK property tax on foreign buyers, with the additional proceeds going to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will support the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge  which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for renting  may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects revenues to rise by up to Â£120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are bought by people with non-British citizenship, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to intervene in the property market.
Many of the affluent areas  especially in the capital  have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the federal income tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by looting land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon quotas for affordable housing to remedy Britain's housing shame.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as Prime Minister to rebuilding the British dream and making the lives of every new generation better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not the place for non-British people and foreign companies to buy homes as easily as hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the indignity of sleeping on the streets remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland team".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said that the biggest ambition of his career is to be the head coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot has taken on the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east of England, who are currently in third place in the Premier League, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one game for the B team and that was it, Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland's games at Hampden as a kid with my dad, so the national team always attracted me.
But that opportunity would only open up if I had success at club level.
Among the predecessors of Ross as manager of Sunderland were names such as Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic has said he feels no discomfort as heir to such established names at such a famous club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success right now is measured by a positive answer to the question, "Can I get this club back into the Premier League?"
Because in structure, base and conditions, it's unquestionably at the level of the Premier League, he said.
It won't be easy to get back to the top level of football, but I'll only accept my success here if I can get the team back there.
Ross has been manager for only three years, after spending time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the Third Division and turned St Mirren from relegation to Championship the following season.
Ross said he felt more comfortable now than during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
I was really at a crossroads, he remembers the time he took Aloa.
I really believed that being a manager was the best career for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and having some significant success.
But being a player is hard sometimes.
There's a lot of stuff you have to deal with every week.
I still face the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel like being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my own skin in my entire conscious life.
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on the radio frequencies of Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 UK summer time.
The ideal time for a beer is 5:30pm on a Saturday, a study reveals.
The summer heat has boosted the income of struggling British pubs, but it has added more stress to restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin from the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "Due to the prolonged sunshine and longer than expected for England's World Cup, July follows a similar pattern to June, when pubs grew by 2.8 per cent, but restaurants took an even bigger hit.
The 1.8 percent drop in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and liquor bars reported the best growth performance compared to the declining movement of restaurants.
Food bars also suffered from the sunshine, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, drinks sales jumped 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from the leisure and entertainment analysts RSM, shared: "These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home service sector.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a decline in sales of 4,8% on an annual basis can be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing costs.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service managers, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired break.
The overall increase in pub and restaurant sales, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand deployment.

One in five children hides a secret social networking account from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study has found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows a rise in fake Insta pages
The news has raised fears that sexual material is being published
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" profile that they showed to their parents
One in five children - some one in 11 - set up a social networking account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in fake Insta accounts  links to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual material is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a pure "basic" profile that they showed to their parents, and they also had secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenage boy encouraging others to "rape" him.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Aylind Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Aylyd Doyle has been elected to join the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described this move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to draw on her rich experience at international level over the last decade.
"Aelide enjoys great respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attraction", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I have a desire to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400-meter finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if he would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
An ad for a milk pump that compares mothers to cows shared online views
A company that makes milk pumps shared the opinion online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows that are being milked.
To mark the launch of the highly anticipated 'world's first wearable silent breast-feeding pump', consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous music-video commercial to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to breast-feeding women to express themselves.
Four real mothers dancing in a cow barn full of hay, to the background of a song with lyrics including: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not you, that's my breasts".
The saying goes, "Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, breast-feed my friends".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many stating that it downplays the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
It's a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take it away a few days after birth, someone wrote.
The Elvie milk pump is assembled discreetly in a suckler bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's understandable that it's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use it to advertise a breastfeeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "So much inadequate advertising".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "extremely funny".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The drain made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little bit lame, but I'll take it as it is.
This product is genius, someone wrote.
Another comment: It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who are sweating (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like they're beautiful.
This is not an advertisement praising or condemning the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, no wires or tubes, and it assembles discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they suck.
Ana Ballarin, partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, comments: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the mammals and the dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the milk drain and all the challenges that come with it, while also showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Martha Yakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being smuggled into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult for children to be placed with guardians.
Usually most guardians are undocumented immigrants who are afraid they risk staying in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints, with this data being shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the persons who are either guardians or family members of guardians are residing in the country illegally, many of them foreign criminals.
So we're going to continue to pursue these individuals, said Albenz.
In an effort to speed up the registration of these children, authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many people show up in a video conference call, not in person, to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are determined to be unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have surfaced from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as this one in Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the site.
They added that moving children to the "tent city" without giving them enough time to prepare on an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends could compound the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria demands that the US, French and Turkish occupation forces withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "they will be dealt with".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleared of both terrorist organizations and any illegal presence of foreigners.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are primarily training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said that conditions were tolerable and they could return, accusing "some Western countries" of "breathing unfounded fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns", he said.
They're turning something into a political issue that's entirely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provided an opportunity for progress in political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
That would be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
There's no sign of any spectator fatigue at this time.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops the cable ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime time nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", says Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama "The Last Candidate", which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovall, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he was voting for Mr. Trump.
She asked "Why?"
Mrs. Scowell told me he said "because it makes me laugh".
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, the desire to be an informed citizen is not the same as watching a panel of experts discuss for six hours Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as the source for his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather pilot jacket (a garment filled with arrogance according to the Washington Post); and Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what it does to make you feel like you're part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night", said Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, regarding the changing cast and daily rotations (eating with the National Football League, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you'll be late.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny on the north shore of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he was locked in his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Investments are pouring in the most controversial race in the congressional primary.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is getting a cash flow thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts and two incumbents for the same seat.
The recent redistricting of a suburban Pittsburgh district nominated conservative Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly out of step with the new 17th.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the party's main funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made his name in Pennsylvania after a tough victory in the widely-discussed March by-election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, then withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only foreseen against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about US$140 million in anti-drug, development and economic aid from the United States.
The proposed sanctions, including cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its unemployment and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that serves as a continuation of a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants into the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made clear their desire for the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will attend the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. lawmakers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further strong announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who requested anonymity and agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the investigation
The next step may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is now substantial evidence in the public record.
It's been alleged that Mr. Mueller is also focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our election.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will mean that Mr. Trump will have to answer to this body just as he prepares to face the voters, and perhaps a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his peers in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, provided the West had resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history depends on such pivotal moments, and the relentless march of democracy is either accelerated or slowed.
Right now, Americans are facing several of these kinds of moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this paper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not fit for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein has declared the story in The Times to be inaccurate.
What do we do if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite the sexual assault and perjury charges?
And most importantly, will we vote in the early congressional elections if it forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of it.
But I believe we won't fail, because I learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about a clash with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue ahead of Group D of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from playing his first game of the season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a springboard to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game hoping we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have won at the end of the game, but overall, the tie seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
We've set our sights on Thursday, another big night of our games in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can give our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened around my injuries and the changes at the club, but now things seem to have gone in the rules direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the training is productive.
I hope we can do everything we can to forget last season and achieve the success we want.
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of the type of care they wanted, few discussed it with family members.
About half of the respondents in a Nationwide survey said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven't taken the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's what you can do to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not state your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counsellor and your family where and how you would like to receive care, as these decisions can be a deciding factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial adviser: Your adviser may even be able to help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your choices when choosing a long-term care financial institution may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles early on.
Appoint a healthcare trustee so that you have a designated trustee to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial plenipotentiary.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs emergency medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details so that you are prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors are", Martin asks.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications, aid organizations are unable to obtain information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about the Palu and Donggala Islands of Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow coastal strip on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal area of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morava, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Dongola in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami wave that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the entire coastal strip of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude rabbit lands Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake rocks one of the Mentawai Islands and triggers a 10-meter tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Pidi Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remember the devastation from the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not activate, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention building and on unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, certainly" when asked to plead, media reports said.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and fined $250,000.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a domestic violence offence and possession of a weapon under the influence of intoxicating substances in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the collision are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palo, when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for a suspect in a New York terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipow, suspected of the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It's alleged that Saipov, 30, used a truck rented from Home Depot to carry out the October bombing of a bike path near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, trampling pedestrians and bicyclists along the way.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious bodily injury, according to the Notice of Intent in connection with the death penalty motion filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges could result in a death sentence.
Weeks after the bombing, an expanded federal grand jury indicted Saipow on 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering-related murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of a police station.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "horrible, cruel and perverse".
Saifullo Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Ernan Feluci and Alejandro Damian Panuko, the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953... Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek by nationality, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment alleges.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty verdict and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all concerned", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to mobilise the People's Army today at a protest at the Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should feel the pressure as one of Theresa May's own party members suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boone, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain would have left by now if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling with the deeply divided ranks of the party has been highlighted by Remain Conservatives who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks from the pro-Brexit, pro-Remain and EU.
Allies insist she will make progress in her attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and urge Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the protesters, who chanted "Out means out" in Solihull, that he wanted to throw Chequers.
He stressed that Mr Farage should have been involved on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to scrap the Chequers plan.
He said: "We did not fight in world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bonn rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The perception that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false'.
Conservative MP Andrea Jenkins also attended the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists who actually took to the streets and really helped us get elected.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers hold their ground when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians should feel the pressure if they are going to change the decision taken after the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us, the people and our political class", he said.
They're trying to change Brexit and we're here today to say we won't let you get away with it.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had held up flags with the words "Conservatives Against Brexit" after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues of the party's app when he revealed himself at the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us they can deploy the IT systems and all the technology of Canada and more, and more, for unimpeded border crossing, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren has said he's seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic representative spoke about her future at a city council meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican state representative Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She's at the center of speculation that she might take Trump's job in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the city hall since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was high time women went to Washington and fixed our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
An arrest has been made in connection with the death of LSU Sims.
LAPD in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting Friday that killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 eastern time.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he admitted to being at the scene of the crime, holding a gun and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is being held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6'6" junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, -- Sims appeared in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after team guidelines helped him beat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team's guidance would play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from first position and seriously upset Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two corners, giving Vettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel made the pit stop first and left Hamilton to deal with the traffic at the end of the column, which looked like it could be decisive for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a daring manoeuvre and a tyre-to- tyre drive, which forced the Ferrari driver reluctantly to clear the inside of the track to avoid a time-over-time penalty after he had already closed the way for his opponent with a dangerous double-defence manoeuvre at the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
After that he even led for a fairly long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly overtake Kimi Raikkonen in the battle for fourth position.
He finally went for a pit stop on lap 44, but failed to catch enough on the next eight laps and eventually Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, as Valterie did a great job all weekend and showed himself to be a real gentleman when he let me get in front of him.
"The team has done an exceptional job to win the first two podiums", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her claim that she did not distribute a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "angry and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen and the good things that have happened these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
You know what?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread it?
Do you remember her answer... did you put the document on?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't give it away.
Well, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September, but Feinstein denies that such a distribution occurred from her office.
"I have not covered up Ford's allegations, I have not spread her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reports.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, just like she wanted.
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you that it was very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault of three women, the president pointed out that the Democrats are using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
Look at the dishonor, the shame, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get their power and control back, the president said according to Mediaite.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants, the team that won the league championship.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League to the Belfast Giants, winning the Dundee rematch 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early in the game with two shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied for the home run before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals sealed their victory.
This is the third Elite League win for Adam Keefe's boys, who have come out on top to beat Dundee in Belfast 2-1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three.
The shot that Dwyer kicked the score came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFaul, and then David Rutherford doubled the lead, assisting Bovillier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan got the hosts back in the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquart helped to tie the game with Cooney's help at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer tried to get the Giants to lead before the first break, scoring the second goal of the night late in the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Boucher again equalized the odds with a powerful knock at the gate at 27:37.
Kaunee and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time this match at the end of the second half, as he gave his all and secured the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but last half.
The Giants, who have lost their last four games in five, will host Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight controller died to make sure that hundreds of people on board a plane could escape an earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
The strong aftershocks continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he decided it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Traffic Control spokesman Johannes Sirat said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Baliqapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Butong was restricted.
"We expect the death toll to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people are not reachable", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached 20 feet [6 m] devastated Palo, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carrying aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance is bringing more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There's looting everywhere in the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and addressed the country's military: I ask you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon is now reporting that one person has been reported missing after it said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they could not contact a male passenger.
The airline added that it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their efforts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities announced that seven people had been admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane overran the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane went too low.
"This is extremely beautiful", says Janes.
Janes says he and the others managed to squeeze through the deep, intersecting water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says that sailors repairing a nearby harbor also helped in the rescue operation, using inflatable boats to get people ashore before the plane sank in the water some 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died on PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of the cases.
Analyzer's showing the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded its briefing on the case this Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice has testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone recordings to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones showing that Tallis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tallis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency is that Tallis said she knew Chambers for two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tallis' death, he deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip-hop has deviated from its origins of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are being revived in the UK through acts such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple after firing them for "racist" post
A New York nanny sues a couple for discrimination-related dismissal after receiving a wrongly-sent text from the mother, who complains that she's "the next black person".
The couple denied being racist, describing the suit as "blackmail".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was stunned to learn that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the embarrassed Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day's work then sent home by taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for the firing, claiming the sum of $350 a day for the six-month contract she was originally hired for, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I'm sure it's discrimination".
In response to the petition, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that terminating Morris' employment was the sensible thing to do, since they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even if it was by mistake?
You're the newborn?
Think about it.
Describing the lawsuit as "extortion", Plasco claims that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
You're gonna attack someone in that state?
That's not very nice, added the investment banker.
While the case is still pending, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, denouncing them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington were concerned that readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, born soon after the book was accepted by the public, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
Now it's a lot of fun, knowing the huge success of Paddington.
She shared that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little teddy bear, would feel optimistic about the eventual rejection of the book, adding that he is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", following his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as "an important member of our family", she added that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very humble man and not a braggart", she said.
But because you felt Paddington was so real, it's like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your doing.
I think he sort of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his own creation and the product of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn't expect to survive", shared Mrs. Ednan-LapÃ©roux.
Then Nad called me to say she was gonna die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given by doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She left some time before that and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have held back.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-LapÃ©roux, who is still grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea of the ordeal she was undergoing.
"No one understood", she shared.
I was leaning my head and tears were dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of belonging to Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her.
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she shared.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lights up every room.
But he quit his job before he left, and found himself in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis shared, "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences".
Mrs. Davis makes the cards so people know there's someone to go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not keep silent. You must speak.
Mrs. Humphries, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, her life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He got to the bottom of Christmas. When the kids opened their presents, he didn't look at them or anything.
She said that it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: It opened a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question as the FBI begins an investigation
"I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants - an investigation of limited duration and scope - maybe we could join forces", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "disintegrating" despite the firm supranational blockade.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the moment.
The primary election is only five weeks away, on November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans don't perform well, their attempts to elect their representative to the state's highest court will be severely damaged.
George W. Bush calls senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes their report?
There's a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear yet if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees is declining under Kim.
A South Korean lawmaker claims that the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byung-soo, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fines from human smugglers were key factors.
There's no official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stability in the nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Congressional Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if any woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and getting emotional when he discussed his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality" organized by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it was clear he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these allegations and the way he's persecuting the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and in the event that the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll put it this way... if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's unfit not only to sit on the Supreme Court, but on the court he's sitting on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for some hysterical, prejudiced man to walk into a courtroom and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?' " concluded Pelosi.
Women need to control themselves, too.
That's valid criticism, after months and years of spreading anger, and she can't take it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't find that unusual, do you?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a CEO somewhere, who told me that she cries when she's angry, but she's developed her own technique, where when she gets angry and cries, she tells her interviewer, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then it just keeps going.
I thought that was genius.
Tears are allowed in the expression of anger, in part because they're misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories from my previous work, in an office mostly with men, is how one day, while I was sobbing in an inexpressible rage, a woman older than me grabbed me by the neck -- a chilling supervisor I'd always been a little afraid of -- and she dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did it to you.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me 30 years later, laughing.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was for one more to show up.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because she was late to the campaign, she was behind in fundraising and decided she would not stay in the race unless she could raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure.
She realizes that some of her supporters who give $1,000 to men would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by so many feelings  gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and be able to address the voters rather than the delegates, and anger at sexism, that she was disillusioned.
"One might think I've had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted.
Some might think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my headstone?
Did she cry?
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is still gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has issued the first warning shot this year by taxing key items of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tension came this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion (Â£150 billion) of manufacturing, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing countered with new tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to respond to any US strike, and the world's second-largest economy is not expected to ignore this anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means giving in to demands, but bowing to Washington in public would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow on Asia at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria has declared itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in rebuilding the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem noted that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to return them to their normal state.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'aleem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that no conditional aid or aid would be accepted from countries that have financed the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
So the U.S. has six straight losses on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the required 14.5 points which guaranteed victory over the United States.
USA star Phil Mickelson, who had been weak for most of the tournament, hit his first hole-in-one (par 3) on the 16th hole in the water, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players in tournament history to reach a 5-0-0 tie since the tournament has been held in its current format since 1979.
The American Jordan Speight lost decisively by 5&4 to the player in the European team, who is at the bottom of the rankings  TorbjÃ¶rn Olesen from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this is likely to be his last Ryder Cup appearance.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cup appearances, became the European's all-time leading scorer in the tournament, this year raising his asset to 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to be able to lift the cup again.
"The team is the most important thing and I'm happy that I was able to help", shared the excited Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the relay to fellow American John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his overall Ryder Cup record is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles - a mark second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed some top-class golf on all days of the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of the team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we were pressing the European team.
There was a fight.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players have done very well.
We'll regroup, discuss the important issues with the Professional Golfers' Association of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll just look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't help but take your hat off to your opponent.
We were just being played.
