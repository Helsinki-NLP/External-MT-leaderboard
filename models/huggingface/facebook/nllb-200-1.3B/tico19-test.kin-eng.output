The overall number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases increased rapidly in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The overall coronavirus (COVID-19) infection figures in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom show that, despite varying degrees of spread by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience in Italy, countries, hospitals and emergency departments must be better prepared to accommodate the large number of COVID-19 patients who will be required to be cared for, especially in terms of care for terminally ill patients.
On 31 December 2019, cases of influenza with unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that you were infected with a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 patients develop mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 results in severe illness requiring hospitalization while in the remaining 6% of cases, illness occurs requiring intensive care.
The rate of hospital deaths from COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we analyze the overall COVID-19 prevalence in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to that in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with those in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread to other countries and the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to that in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri and colleagues published the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO patient definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were identified by France on 24 January 2020 in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 15 March and 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were reported in Italy alone.
Determining the overall number of COVID-19 cases and how it is spread in general
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) reports country-by-country COVID-19 cases worldwide from reliable sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health agencies and WHO, which are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the status of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it to Italy.
To reflect the current status of COVID-19 cases, we have collected the 14 days COVID-19 cases, thus focusing on the COVID-19 transmission pattern in each EU/EEA Member State and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also show the number of cases reported by each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Status of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
Overall, the overall COVID-19 prevalence in the EU/EEA and UK over the last 14 days is similar to that in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
Overall in the EU/EEA and UK, COVID-19 cases started to rise around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional information).
This was mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK, where there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases (Additional information).
Figure 2 shows the estimated number of COVID-19 cases, across EU/EEA and UK countries and Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March 8:00, the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases equal to or less than Italy's in the previous 3 weeks.
Our conclusions suggest that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 will soon rise in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the overall COVID-19 infection figures indicates that the epidemic is spreading at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries have different levels of testing, health practices are changing, and the definition of infection may vary from country to country, and there are different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including testing for those who have not yet been tested.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas in Italy reported that up to 10% of COVID-19 patients needed emergency room care and media reports that hospitals and emergency departments in those areas had already received a number that could not be exceeded.
Data on COVID-19 hospitalizations or emergency care currently available at EU/EEA level is currently only 6% and 1% respectively (data not disclosed).
However, it needs to be compiled in detail to provide data on current patient follow-up focusing on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A 2010 study11 found that emergency rooms and nursing homes are available in varying sizes across Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less facilities than Italy (it had 12.5 emergency and non-emergency beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010).
The sixth update of the ECDC's COVID-19 emergency response brief, which includes examples of patients exceeding capacity, is accompanied by estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK of COVID-19 hospitalized patients and 90% of those exceeding emergency room beds.
As some regions in the EU/EEA and UK are currently the most affected, and hospitals and emergency departments are usually more likely to receive people from a specific region, information on patients and emergency beds should be available at the Regional Statistics Level 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and the situation in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and emergency departments must prepare to deal with the continuing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population and the rising number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, especially in terms of critical care, as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC Emergency Response Assessment, it is important to use rapid and early public response to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2, thus replacing preventive measures with confinement, as the expected rise in cases may leave decision-makers and hospitals with insufficient time to analyze, agree on and implement appropriate measures if not taken early.
A quick analysis of the issues also indicates public health measures taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There are few opportunities for countries to further step up their efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on health systems.
If this is not done, it is likely that health authorities in other EU/EEA countries will face a problem of a high number of serious cases in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and around the world, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
Like the similar virus, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by mosquitoes and has similar symptoms and symptoms.
However, COVID-19 is less aggressive and less lethal than SARS, although it is more rapidly transmitted and more common in older adults than in young people and in men than women.
In view of the increasing number of publications on this new disease, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive and meaningful review of this increasingly researched topic.
We focus on the basic outcomes such as the disease's identity, cause, virus, diagnosis, treatment, transmission and prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this study will help identify and eradicate this health-threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has set a historic record for all Chinese who were asked to stay home throughout the holidays and for several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus has many similarities to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease strain is now known as CoV 19 Disease (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and spread throughout the country and to some 50 countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported, of which more than 40,000 had been discharged and more than 3,000 had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "general enemy No. 1" and that it can have a greater impact than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications have been published on COVID-19 including information on the virus that causes it, its pathogen, its origin, its diagnosis and treatment since the first report was published on 7 January 2020 describing the viral characteristics of various patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research that has been done on this new and highly researched topic.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-borne diseases, such as Middle East flu (MERS, identified in 2012).
We will explore the lessons learned so far on preventing the spread and identifying the root cause of the disease and some of the urgent questions that remain unanswered.
CoVs, which are generally considered non-lethal viruses, are the most common cause of the 4 most common influenza viruses at a rate of about 15%.
However, in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then spread to many other countries with countless infections and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third confirmed outbreak of CoV in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1 below, cases of influenza with unknown cause were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 and reported to the National Health Commission of China.
A seven-day post-COV status document was released.
The first death in Wuhan occurred on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to other cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, cases of infection among doctors were reported, which means that humans can be infected with the virus.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed under a lockdown and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical trial of the disease revealed that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had reached the seafood market in Wuhan, where the infection was believed to have originated from an unidentified animal.
On 30 January, WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and some 50 other countries worldwide (Figure (Figure 2).2).
With the rapid spread of the epidemic, it is difficult to predict the extent and impact of the outbreak.
On 11 February 2020, a cross-institutional study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 provided a more up-to-date picture of the current state of the epidemic, available on the website (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a wide range of ages, but are predominantly between the ages of 30 and 65.
About half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years old, a small number were under 20, and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
Men are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread especially in Hubei and surrounding areas.
On average, the time from COVID-19 detection to detection is about 5 (2-9) days.
It took an average of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) to show symptoms.
The average age of the first death was 9.5 (4,8-13) years after the first case.
The baseline susceptibility (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the median R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased sharply before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the mass travel ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed incidence was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the overall mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main issues with COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe asthma.
CoVs are a subset of large, membrane-bound viruses that contain single-stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four types, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta CoVs are the most susceptible to human infection.
The head (S) membrane glycoprotein binds to ACE2 and DPP4 receptors in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the sequences are correlated.
The viral RNA genome is transcribed into the cell; once the viral genome is transcribed, the genomic RNA is accompanied by glycoproteins that bind to the nucleocapsid proteins to form a nucleotide complex that binds to the plasma membrane to form the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome variant was identified on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV variant with a 99,98% genetic match in 10 genetic tests taken at the outbreak site, at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 has more similar genes to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
In electron microscopy for infection, SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in the deepest parts of the respiratory epithelium of humans.
The ACE2 gene in humans has been identified for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 receptor much less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 infects patients less severely than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be a new short protein produced by the orf3b protein and a newly discovered protein produced by the orf8 protein.
The orf3b protein in SARS-CoV-2 may be involved in the pathogenicity of the virus and in inhibiting IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 protein does not have known morphology or status.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the cryogenic electron microscope (cryo-EM) detection of a complete human ACE2 at a thickness of 2.9 Å in the amino acid B0AT1 transport chain.
They found that the complex, which has both open and closed structures, binds as a double helix and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which are a marker of the expression and infection of the CoV virus.
B0AT1 may be used in the testing of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The first animal to be infected
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and then were transmitted to humans by camels and rats.
Using the SARS-CoV-2 cross-genesis with other CoVs, it was determined that the bacteria were SARS-CoV-2's ancestor as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs derived from the bacteria called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
But the first infected animal that enabled the virus to spread from one species to another is not known, and the mechanism of transmission is not well understood.
Ji and colleagues suggested that snakes may have been the first to infect humans with the virus, which was caused by a mutation in the S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that mammals, long-mouthed, star-eating mammals that are widely used by Chinese medical professionals, may have been the first to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the 99% similarity in gene structure found in the reptile CoV virus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference observed in both genomes is still large; therefore, conclusive evidence is awaited (Figure 33).
Most of the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive for up to 48 hours in a warm environment and up to 5 days in a temperature below 20 °C and a temperature between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be resistant to sunlight and to temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, detergents containing coral, peracetic acid, choroform, and other oily solvents, but not choroxidine, can effectively kill the virus.
In general, all people are not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to the new virus.
At present, no extensive studies are being conducted on the body's response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we only use previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
In general, once the virus has entered the infected person, it is first detected by natural immunity via a receptor differentiation receptor (PRR) that includes the C-type reginine-like receptor, the TLR receptor, the NLR receptor, and the RLR receptor.
In a variety of ways, viral inflammation, inflammation of the host cell, and the accumulation of IFN (type I) proteins produced to fight the virus slow the spread of the virus and increase the consumption of the pathogenic virus.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to break through the immune response.
After a short time, the body's immune system begins to fight the virus.
T cells include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that play an important role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies that can fight the virus, which in turn kills the infected cells.
Helper T cells produce cytokines that help to burn to help protect cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function leading to T cell death.
Fluid immunity including C3a and C5a and antibodies is also important in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies removed from a recovered patient have been shown to inhibit MERS-CoV.
In addition, excessive immunity leads to the production of large numbers of unwanted cells in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, if it goes wrong, organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in early infection, is more common in older adults with other conditions than in pregnant women.
People with high viral load or poor immune function are often at higher risk of infection.
The average duration of SARS-CoV-2 before symptoms appear is between 1 and 14 days, usually between 3 and 7 days based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the time taken for symptoms to appear was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
The most recent study, as mentioned above, found the time to onset of symptoms to be 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a total of 8,866 patients.
It is important that health authorities establish appropriate quarantine times based on the exact time it takes for symptoms to become more apparent, thus preventing infected but asymptomatic individuals from infecting others.
As a general rule, people who have been exposed to the infection or have been infected with the virus are required to quarantine for 14 days.
If the quarantine period is extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first major symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, multiple colds, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and vomiting.
Some patients have difficulty breathing or low blood oxygen levels within a week of exposure.
Patients with severe depression have experienced severe respiratory problems, low blood pressure, acidity problems and hypertension.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if they do not show any symptoms of pulmonary problems, should be tested for the virus early.
A patient-group study conducted in late December 2019 showed a 98% symptom-representative ratio for fever, 76% for whooping cough, 55% for oxygen problems and 3% for diarrhea; 8% for patients who requested respiratory aids.
Similar conclusions were made in two recent studies of family and non-symptomatic cases.
Similar to this study, a 2012 case study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), whooping cough (47%) and oxygen deficiency (55%) as primary symptoms.
However, 80% of those requests for respirators are higher than for COVID-19 patients and the death rate from MERS is higher than for COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), whooping cough (29%-75%), oxygen problems (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were found to be the most severe symptoms with patients requiring respiratory aids reaching about 14%-20%.
On 14 February, the COVID-19 death rate was 2% when the global confirmed cases were 66,576.
As with the virus, the death rate from SARS was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases in November 2002.
For MERS, based on infection data from June 2012, the fatality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies have shown that the baseline infection rate (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 was high at 6.47, the 95% infection rate (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is found in Table Table 1.1.
The data reported suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but a lower mortality rate than the other two.
Therefore, it is more effective against SARS-CoV-2 than against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The redheaded are usually seen in the same family or congregation or in the same vehicle as the boat they travel in.
Patients have usually been in or traveled to Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected or sick individuals within the two weeks prior to their arrest.
However, it has been shown that people can be symptom-free for more than two weeks and that recovered patients who are discharged from hospital may still be infected, suggesting a need to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or low white blood cell counts (especially stem cells) in the first few days.
For example, the minimum number of white blood cells is 4×109/L including 1×109/L of stem cells, and high levels of amino transferase (AST) and viral isolates have been observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of dark matter and myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and the accumulation of dark matter and erythrocytes has increased in the blood of many patients.
In the more severe patients, the level of D-dima, a decay-induced protein found in the blood, was elevated, and the number of stem cells decreased.
Problems with the respiratory system are common in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by either bilateral pressure or pulmonary hypertrophy (PMS).
Patients often develop acute diarrhea, acute lung ulcers and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of acute respiratory distress disorder (ARDS), extreme heat, fluid buildup and pulmonary inflammation severely impair air circulation.
The dysfunction of pinemosytes type I and II reduces the amount of interstitial cells and increases the ability of the joints to replicate, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and thus increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, poor radiation response is often associated with an increased risk of infection.
On 18 February 2020, the first analysis of the COVID-19 virus revealed pinemositis, inflammation of the pulmonary arteries, a splenic tumor, and a high concentration of collagen cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which corresponds to the origin of viral infection and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is similar to SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using laboratory RT-PCR has been used as a primary test for COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false positives, which can lead to further spread of the epidemic, screening was started for screening (no longer focused on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
This was also the case with the SARS test.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, symptoms, laboratory tests and diagnostic results is important and necessary to make an accurate diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, a team led by Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects RNA-like RNA molecules of SARS-CoV-2 at a rate of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of input) using a mavutta scale in less than an hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique could significantly improve the quality if tested in clinical trials.
Due to the lack of familiarity with new CoVs, physicians may initially be in close proximity to COVID-19 patients, while testing a variety of prescribed or targeted therapies prior to treating other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Table (Table 2).2).
These include medications that can be used with or against viruses, immunosuppressants, anti-inflammatory drugs, plasma extracted from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and cardiovascular therapy.
It was hoped that plasma extracted from recovered patients could be used to treat the virus.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing vaccines to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lungs and may, in low concentrations, also infect other ACE2-producing cells such as the adrenal gland and the kidneys.
However, malfunction and dysfunction of the respiratory system are the most serious health problems and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential to alleviate symptoms and to save lives and includes general ventilation, maximum ventilation, moderate ventilation and ventilation on ventilator for the duration of the illness.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be advised to avoid ECMO supplementation, an alternative cardiopulmonary respiratory method used to treat those with severe cardiac or respiratory problems.
In addition, attention to renal function, prevention and treatment of other diseases and hypotension, and maintenance of function of vital organs are also beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine excess is caused by excessive immune response in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine uptake is a mechanism of the innate immune response characterized by the detection of various cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release large amounts of unstable cells which are the primary cause of ARDS and multiple cell death.
Immunosuppression is useful in the treatment of cytokine overload, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilismab, a single-corone antibody that acts against IL6, have been used to treat cytokine overload.
Other immunosuppressant drugs for the treatment of cytokine overdose include immunosuppressants for T cells; inhibitors of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibitors of JAK; drugs for the treatment of cytokine 4 symptoms; and HDAC inhibitors.
Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of immune response.
However, taking multiple anti-inflammatory drugs did not have an effect on lung lesions with severe lesions in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause serious complications, especially osteoporosis (AVN), which has a significant impact on the treatment of disease.
However, it is recommended that low and moderate doses of corticosteroids be administered to severely impaired COVID-19 patients in a short and prudent manner.
At the time of writing, a positive antibody to the virus has been identified.
But the injection of remdesivir, a nucleotide-like drug, has been shown to be effective in an American with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg virus infections.
Later, remdesivir also showed its ability to inhibit other RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on the above, Gilead has provided the vaccine to China for two studies on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, with the public eagerly awaiting the results.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been shown to be effective in treating patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and other serious complications may occur with combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions between this medicinal product and other medicinal products used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma extracted from recovered patients by antibody activity
The collection of blood from recovered infectious persons for the purpose of treating others with the same disease or preventing the transmission of the disease to non-infected persons has been a long-standing practice.
Yes, recovered patients often have a high level of antibodies against the virus in their blood.
The antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight viruses and other pathogens and recognize single viral molecules and kill them.
Based on the above, plasma is extracted from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and then injected into 10 patients who are severely affected.
Symptoms began to improve within 24 hours, with decreased inflammation and viral counts and increased oxygen in the blood.
But further evaluation is needed to provide a wide range of patients before specific treatments are developed.
Also, due to the pharmacological effects, some of the adverse effects associated with plasma should be carefully evaluated.
For example, antibodies can over-exert the body's immune system and then trigger the production of cytokines, which can be life-threatening toxins.
Antibodies are usually low in the blood and higher plasma levels are required for the treatment of critically ill patients.
It is not possible to develop specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global pandemic.
It is therefore necessary and desirable to extract B cells from recovered patients and then to identify the genes that code for acute antibodies or to test for acute antibodies that are compared to the essential proteins of the virus.
By doing so, we can actually increase the production of the immune system.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments in China.
But its effectiveness is largely based on the combination of different drugs in a variable manner due to the diagnosis of disease based on the methodology used in TCM.
Many of the most effective drugs are not known or are not well known because of the difficulty of developing and controlling these drugs or their compounds.
Currently, due to the lack of a specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the most effective complementary treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen drops have been shown to be potentially useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
High recovery rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in many provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of local patients, such as Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), and Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest recovery rate (13%).
But this is a poor estimate because many other factors such as patient numbers and morbidity must be taken into account in the analysis.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing single-use therapy in Europe and the US with a combination of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required to regain normal body temperature, develop symptoms and be admitted to hospital was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Interestingly, the severity of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still awaits further research in large populations and in many institutions.
It is also advisable to demonstrate the efficacy of these drugs and to explain the benefits of TCM alone or in combination with other drugs if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection often have a high risk of infection and death, and those who are isolated may also experience a negative reaction, loneliness and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, shortness of breath, cough and adverse drug reactions such as corticosteroid insomnia can lead to increased stress and mental health problems.
At the beginning of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric disorders were identified including chronic depression, anxiety, panic, paranoia, delusions, depression, and suicidal ideation.
The mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of the COVID-19 response by public health agencies can lead to increased anxiety and guilt about the consequences of infection, isolation and discrimination from family and friends.
Mental health services should therefore be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected contacts and other people in general who need support.
Counseling should include the establishment of multi-agency mental health teams, a comprehensive system of regular updates on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the management of patients, and the use of digital tools and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to prevent infection between infected animals and humans and other animals or humans that may be infected and are often complementary to antiviral medicines in fighting infections caused by new viruses.
There have been efforts to develop S protein-based vaccines to create long-term antibodies or to increase the body's resistance to SARS-CoV.
Vaccines using inactivated viruses have been tested in animals for SARS.
However, the efficacy of this vaccine in healthy older and critically ill animals and in protecting against animal-derived infections cannot be determined without clinical studies.
This may be because it has been 17 years since SARS was first discovered and no one else has been infected.
On the other hand, a small number of cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and the virus is spreading to other regions due to the continuous transmission of animals to humans in areas of high prevalence.
Measures have been developed to prevent MERS using deactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, ultra-fine particles, viral-like particles and proteins that are self-replicating and some of these measures have been tested in animals.
Developing an effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for people without immunity is a necessary and urgent step in the fight against the pandemic.
However, it is difficult to solve this problem because of the long time (about 18 months) required for the vaccine to be produced by the mutant CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun to show a potential treatment in thousands of infected patients.
Patients can often recover without any side effects.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also highly contagious and deadly in severe cases.
Therefore, the development of a treatment plan is essential for hospitals and clinics to be able to make the most of their services or in areas with insufficient facilities.
Based on clinical studies conducted to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the progression of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age is a critical factor in the diagnosis of SARS, as is COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affected those aged 30 to 65 years with 47.7% being over 50 years of age in a study of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients who requested ICU admission were more likely to have other conditions and conditions and were significantly older than those who did not request admission (average age 66 to 51 years), indicating that age is a factor in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection.
Gender: Men were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000), as defined by the CDC.
Concomitant conditions: COVID-19 patients seeking emergency room admission often have severe, inflammatory and convulsive heart problems.
Cardiovascular disease has also been a major cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can also attack ACE2-containing ant-pathogen proteins, causing dark circles in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that the age of the person with the disease is strongly correlated and can affect the outcome.
Special laboratory findings: The level of the red blood cell protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of tumor or tissue lesions and has been shown to be one of the potential factors in the treatment of disease, drug reception and recovery.
A link between CRP and age and COVID-19 immunity has also been identified.
In addition, high levels of LDH, AST, ALT, and CK can also predict the outcome of treatment.
These lesions are highly expressed in various tissues, especially in the heart and in the dark, and are released when the organs are damaged.
They are therefore the most common indicator of heart problems or darkness.
Key symptoms: Chest pain and transient symptoms should be considered along with other issues in the planning of COVID-19 diagnosis.
Use of anti-inflammatory drugs: As mentioned above, anti-inflammatory drugs are immunosuppressant drugs that are commonly used as adjuvant medications in the treatment of infectious diseases to reduce the inflammation of immune response.
Because high doses of corticosteroids have been used extensively in severe SARS patients, many patients have recovered from osteoporosis with permanent disability and poor health.
Therefore, when necessary, COVID-19 patients should take low doses of anti-inflammatory medication and for a short period of time.
Stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients experienced extreme stress due to prolonged isolation and severe depression and the loss of close relatives of those who had been infected.
It is important to provide these patients with psychosocial counseling and long-term support to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the patient studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different characteristics from SARS.
In addition to respiratory tract infection, SARS-CoV-2 can enter the respiratory tract through the nose and throat and cause mild or no symptoms in the early days of infection, as with other commonly occurring influenza-causing CoVs.
Therefore, patients infected in the early days or during the onset of symptoms may have a high number of viruses functioning normally, thus making the fight against the disease more effective.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV has been shown to occur when patients are infected, as most cases are not contagious in the early days.
Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS pandemic.
Currently, a number of measures are being implemented in China, including a curfew in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuing quarantine of nearly all populations to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have severely disrupted the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most interesting estimate is that the epidemic will end in March, and the recovery period will be between 3 and 4 months.
But some experts are skeptical.
Paul Hunter and colleagues found that COVID-19, which is more infectious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a predictive model for the end of the pandemic and predicted that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the chest and throat samples of recovered patients 2 weeks after discharge, suggesting that the new virus may be a recurrent influenza.
But there are encouraging signs in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the measures taken may be productive.
Initial estimates were that one million people would contract Ebola and 500,000 would die.
But thanks to strict quarantine measures, the disease was successfully contained.
Like SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infections may become rare and then become extinct or become a less lethal virus in human contact.
A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS is shown in the following table (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted by contact with infected objects.
The virus has also been detected in the urine, suggesting that there may be a new mode of transmission of oral contact with the urine.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of patients may have been infected by hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 physicians.
Therefore, greater vigilance is needed to protect people, especially doctors, social workers, relatives of patients, coworkers, and even travelers who may come into contact with patients or infected people.
The first precautionary measure that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; the use of medical and N95 masks (class # 1860s) helps to prevent the spread of the virus.
Medical masks help to prevent contaminated air or contact with other people from being passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (class # 1860s) are effective at absorbing airborne viruses at 10 to 80 nm, with 5% of the virus being able to pass through; SARS-CoV-2 is about the same size as SARS-CoV and both are 85 nm.
Because some areas can pass through five medical masks in succession, physicians who frequently see patients should wear N95 masks (class # 1860s) instead of medical masks.
In addition to wearing masks, doctors should wear special suits to further reduce the risk of infection.
Viruses can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; this suggests that the virus may have entered his body through his face.
Thus, doctors must also wear face shields or refractive lenses when caring for patients.
For people generally living in areas where the virus is or may be spread, it is absolutely essential that everyone wash their hands frequently with disinfectant, try to isolate themselves and stay home and avoid contact with people who may be infected.
A distance of one and a half meters should be maintained between the patient and the person.
These practices are an important way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to humans as a new virus, the fact that it has many similarities to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 must have caused China to be highly suspicious as it recalled the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the head of Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the public that the new virus is not highly contagious and that people are not highly contagious and therefore the control and eradication of the disease is not a problem.
This message has significantly eased public awareness, especially as the country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and the chances of preventing the outbreak in Wuhan are diminished.
China's disease control agencies can learn from this big lesson and make big changes in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more discerning in providing public information as the public takes every word into account and then changes their behavior and decisions; (2) be more attentive to the unique information provided by hospitals and make appropriate decisions rather than waiting for reports from doctors or officials in a formal manner; (3) take more action to prevent the entire outbreak from occurring instead of trying to calm the public; and (4) organize multi-disciplinary workshops to help the public become more aware of the epidemic and try to improve response in different situations.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to some 50 other countries worldwide by the time we wrote this report.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to speculation that SARS is returning.
However, there are distinct differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in the prevention of the outbreak and in the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and affects men more than women, and the age and mortality rates are also higher among older people than young people.
SARS is more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when they are asymptomatic and SARS patients are more likely to spread the virus when they are ill, making it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This is one of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and over a larger area than SARS-CoV.
An approved RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may not be infectious in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be re-infected.
All of this greatly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Despite this stage of COVID-19 research, several key questions remain to be answered:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is a 96% similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs from bats, we cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
Which animal was the first to transmit a virus from a virulent source, say a tick, to humans?
Unless we know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread of the virus, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular and genetic testing has shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract and cause subsequent disease mutations?
Does the virus infect ACE2 producing cells in other tissues?
Until we have definitive answers to these questions, we cannot quickly and accurately diagnose and adequately treat the virus.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve as it spreads from person to person?
Will it become a global pandemic, a SARS-like outbreak, or a recurrent flu?
Finding answers to these and many other questions is important but may take time.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return people to normal life.
Animals infected with human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have caused both human and animal coronavirus (CoVs) to evolve over thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human-infected CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East influenza (MERS) have changed the paradigm of how HCoVs can be devastating and life-threatening.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in mid-late 2019 has led to a resurgence of media coverage of CoVs and has been surprising due to its high infectivity but low pathogenicity compared to its counterpart SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are a zoonotic disease and therefore identifying the zoological origin of HCoVs can be helpful.
Most HCoVs have been isolated from bacteria and are not pathogenic.
Animals previously infected with some of the HCoVs are also unknown.
Knowing your pets has a direct effect on preventing infectious diseases.
Research into animal interactions with CoVs may also be useful in determining how CoVs infect humans.
In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their origin and how they spread between different species.
The most important is that we compare different HCoVs by focusing on how the virus mutates and how the genome is expressed.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is being studied in this area.
In addition, the documentation required for the transmission of the virus to the effects and mutations of the viral pathogen is also presented.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of RNA viruses that are highly pathogenic and highly resistant.
These viruses contain large genomes with 26 to 32 kilobytes of RNA viruses called CoVs because they are crown-like in the electron microscope.
In terms of morphology, CoVs have unbroken genomes that are structurally identical.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large, closely related proteins (ORF1a and ORF1b), which form the proteins pp1a and pp1ab with different functions.
The oppositely charged proteins are then modified to form 16 homologous proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains ORFs of uniformly arranged proteins, including the head (S), tail (E), number (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The protein is highly expressed in families that are also expressed by different families of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein structure, CoVs are divided into four subtypes (alufa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delita-CoV), with the beta-CoV subtype being the most common HCoV and divided into four families (A, B, C and D).
The primary evidence has shown that bats and bats are the primary ancestors of the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary co-infectants of gamma-CoVs and delita-CoVs.
Over millennia, CoVs have been common in a variety of strains and some have been shown to be potent viruses that can infect humans.
To date, only seven human-infected CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
The HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are among the alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute influenza coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East influenza coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
On the other hand, the recently identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic viruses, causing severe respiratory disease in the lung in many patients at high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary distress.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was identified in nasal fluid of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, there has been a growing body of knowledge from extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause pathogenicity.
Yes, it was widely accepted that HCoVs were normally non-communicable until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the deadliest outbreaks in recent history, affecting 8,000 people and killing about 10%.
A decade later, the Middle East flu (MERS) epidemic has spread to a pandemic that is common in the Arabian Peninsula and occasionally to other parts of the world.
The novel 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) which, as of 2 March 2020, has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000.
The world has long been warned to prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs originate from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several studies have shown that HCoVs are derived from mosquitoes, with which the viruses are often unrelated, but which are genetically distinct.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious health, education, social and behavioral problems in China and around the world.
The study of animal HCoVs provides a way to understand natural history, causation and barriers to species crossing.
This may also help or facilitate the search for a host of SARS-CoV-2, the first infection and the primary cause of its spread, which could have a significant impact on preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a summary of the animal origin of HCoVs, their transmission across species and pathogenicity.
In particular, we point out and discuss the commonly held view that HCoVs are not normally pathogenic to their hosts but rather to humans or newly infected animals after spread across species.
We also study the evolution of HCoVs where high prevalence often results in a decrease in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also examine the ultimate outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
CoVs have been known to infect animals since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first detection of the HCoV-229E strain, B814, in nasal secretions of patients with the common cold, several CoVs were detected from various infected animals, including mice, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoVs discovery (Table 1) provides information on human response.
The first HCoV-229E strain was identified in the respiratory tract of patients with nasopharyngeal disease in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have shown common flu symptoms, including headache, diarrhea, nausea and sore throat, with fever and cough occurring in 10~20% of patients.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was found in the embryonic stem cell and was detected in the brain of mammals.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is not distinguishable from infections caused by other respiratory viruses such as avian influenza virus and common influenza virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both globally prevalent, and are most commonly spread during the spring and autumn.
The average time for both viruses to show symptoms is less than a week, followed by an infection duration of about 2 weeks.
As demonstrated in voluntary studies, non-infected individuals with HCoV-229E have been exposed to non-malignant influenza.
A small number of patients with immunological problems developed acute respiratory chest disease.
SARS, also known as SARS-CoV-2, was the first fully studied HCoV outbreak in human history to be caused by SARS-CoV, the third identified HCoV.
The first case of SARS was identified in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS outbreak has infected 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Except for highly contagious individuals, it has been shown that each patient may be as likely to infect as two others, with the time to onset of symptoms being between 4 and 7 days and the virus reaching its peak on day 10 of infection.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced joint pain, headache, fever, nausea and tremor, followed by difficulty breathing, coughing and severe respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Decreased stem cell count, poor dark matter testing and increased acute creatinine levels are the problems that SARS identifies in the laboratory.
Severe respiratory distress disorder (DAD), epithelial proliferation and immune cell proliferation are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require emergency room treatment and ventilation.
In addition to respiratory tract infections, various organ damage such as lung, kidney and liver can also occur in these severely ill patients, often resulting in an increase in cytokines, which may be fatal especially in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was first identified in a lung swab of a patient who had first been infected with the virus and had traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a number of advances have been made in the field of HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was first identified in a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first seen in infants, adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Nose-burn, eye redness, eye-burn and bronchitis are the most common causes of HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study identified the virus in a nasal swab taken from an 8-month-old male with measles in the Netherlands.
Although it originated in the Netherlands, it is actually found worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to cause about 4.7% of common respiratory infections, and is most common in early June, winter, and spring.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a cold-blooded virus that causes nasal congestion.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man hospitalized with measles and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the pathogenic influenza and boronhormonal disease, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to cause an increased risk of infection in patients with influenza.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been identified globally, causing mild respiratory illnesses.
All four HCoVs are highly pathogenic and are generally unlikely to mutate into highly pathogenic viruses, although there have been cases of unknown causes such as the rare case of the highly pathogenic HCoV-NL63 virus, which was recently identified as causing severe respiratory illness in China.
In general, when these HCoVs are found to have the potential to spread and persist in humans, they have a low susceptibility or infectious capacity.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases identified by laboratory tests originated in the Middle East, cases of other migrants occasionally infecting cohabiting individuals have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another mild outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive inflammation.
In addition to SARS, MERS patients also developed severe renal impairment, thus making MERS the most common HCoV infection to date.
Over 30% of patients develop symptoms of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as nausea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory tests have identified patients with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to date.
From mid-2019 to late December, cases of influenza commonly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) a public health emergency of global concern, also known as COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
In this context, the mortality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, and outside the province is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe influenza-like illnesses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are associated with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Some patients have had seizures.
Gastritis is one of the most severe symptoms and can lead to rapid respiratory problems.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the large number of similarities in nucleotide structure of about 82%, they have different branches on the stem.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported and may be contributing to the rapid global spread.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals similarities and differences that should be considered.
First, the time it takes for symptoms to appear and the duration of HCoV infection are closely related.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between that of SARS-CoV and that of the four locally isolated HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 presents a more common symptom during infection than the locally transmitted HCoVs, which may be characterized by mild or no symptoms.
Also, a very small number of COVID-19 patients may also be detected during SARS-CoV infection, although the rate is slightly lower.
The first is the presence of a virus that is not a virus, but a virus that is a virus.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of host HCoVs depending on the location.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to investigate whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human introduction as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in viral tests.
Future studies should determine whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and oral fluid is as significant as SARS-CoV in at least some areas.
It is also important to specifically look at whether SARS-CoV-2 is as susceptible to a variety of conditions as HCoVs are to a variety of strains depending on their location.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human exposure will contribute to the end of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
HCoVs are typically characterized by their four mildly localized strains that have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it is also possible that it is actually humans who are able to adapt to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could have survived past HCoV outbreaks.
HCoVs that cause acute human disease and people with acute HCoV disease have died.
To survive, human coronavirus (HCoV) produce enough proteins to allow them to mutate and destroy the antibody protein that inhibits the virus from multiplying.
Therefore, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads and infects more people, there is a greater risk that it will become fully adapted to the human body.
If it is well adapted, further transmission in the population will be difficult to control with quarantine or other measures.
Over the years, four types of out-of-hospital CoVs have been transmitted to humans, causing infection in normally immunocompromised individuals.
These viruses do not need to be present in animals.
On the other hand, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses have not adapted well to the human body, making transmission to humans short-lived.
They need to be replicated in host animals while awaiting transmission to humans with low immunity, via one or more of their primary predators and hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar morphology to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the HCoV four-transmitted virus.
It is as transmissible as the HCoVs that are transmitted outside hospitals, at least for now.
However, it is more virulent than non-hospital HCoVs and is not as virulent as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt to humans and move between humans without a predator.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it is worth discussing the definitions and characteristics of the animals in which HCoVs mutate, naturally coexist, breed, grow, and reproduce.
The HCoV is transmitted to animals when they are closely related to a common ancestor that shares many of the same genomic characteristics.
The animal-derived virus is normally adapted and does not cause disease in the animal.
The animal that has been hosted thus remains a host of the HCoV virus for a long time.
For both reasons, the infected animals are either infected with the HCoV or the vector virus.
On the other hand, when HCoVs are introduced as novel to a host shortly before or near the time of human infection, they are not well adapted to the target and often cause disease.
The host may be the most susceptible animal to human infection, which causes the virus to spread rapidly and spread to humans by increasing the rate of human infection.
The HCoV may be non-infectious if it has not been able to mutate in its host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can adapt to and remain in a host for a long time.
In this case, the animal that grows on it becomes a naturally-occurring hybrid.
Epidemiological data indicate that the first case of SARS was transmitted during sport hunting.
Subsequent blood tests showed that commercial animals had a higher immunity to SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
The first case of a SARS-CoV-like virus was identified in a mouse and a puppy in the animal market.
This was directly confirmed by the continued spread of SARS after it killed all the bats in the market.
However, it has been reported that wild or feral mice have not been exposed to market animals and have been tested positive for SARS-CoV, meaning that mice may also be a major source of SARS-CoV in which they can thrive but not naturally coexist.
In particular, with 80% of the animal species in Guangzhou's market having antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is undeniable that many species of small mammals are susceptible to SARS-CoV.
Both of these appear to be non-transmissible to SARS-CoV.
Subsequent animal studies with the immature SARS-CoV virus showed that the CoV was very similar to the bat CoV, which is named bat SARS CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese bats.
The bacteria have antibodies against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene.
These other bat-type CoVs share 88-92% of the SARS-CoV genome.
The study confirmed the new idea that the viruses in the premature larvae infect humans.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in bats, but none other than WIV1 is considered a pathogen.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 is extracted from the testes of the small intestine using ACE2 to enter the body.
Surprisingly, the serum of SARS patients was able to inhibit the WIV1 virus.
To date, WIV1 has been shown to be predominantly derived from SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% of the species being common only in bats.
Although the two viruses are closely related, it is generally thought that WIV1 is not the causative agent of SARS-CoV and that the bacteria are not the primary hosts of SARS-CoV.
A mutation analysis of the virus classifies MERS-CoV into two groups, CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 from bats.
Both the bat-CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV are receptors for the same DPP4 protein, which is used by the virus to enter the body.
The RNA polymerase protein in MERS-CoV is very similar to its beta-CoV host virus found in Europe and Africa.
At present, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in wild boar.
MERS-CoV and the closely related strain of the mosquito CoV-HKU25 are only 87% identical in the mouse.
Thus, the larvae may not be the MERS-CoV host.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels have a particularly weak immune system to MERS-CoV, as do camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV virus is similar to the human virus from camel nasal samples, which further suggests that camels are the true host of the MERS-CoV virus.
It should also be noted that the overall evidence of mild but extensive viral transmission was found in camels tested for MERS-CoV.
In particular, infected camels have released the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the urinary tract, which is the primary route of transmission of the virus from the larvae.
However, concerns remain as most confirmed MERS cases have not been in contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which could be attributed to human transmission or unknown transmission and could possibly be an unidentified animal strain carrying the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% of the genome and the CoV RaTG13 from the mouse was isolated from the mouse.
In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to be considered homogenous.
Bedbugs may not be the primary host of SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar CoV is detected in the future.
The animals that feed on SARS-CoV-2 are likely to be the wildlife that is sold and forgotten in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where most of the first COVID-19 cases originated, suggesting that animals may have transmitted the virus to humans.
Several recent metagenome-based studies have suggested that a group of endangered microorganisms known as the parasitic worms may also be derived from the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV.
The newly identified mouse CoVs contain 85-92% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
However, they are as closely related to RaTG13 as 90% of the species.
They belong to two subclasses of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the viral evolution, one of which has a RBD protein that is 97.4% similar to SARS-CoV-2 in its amino acid structure.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although they are highly similar in terms of genome sequence.
Previous studies of mosquito-borne diseases have also reported the detection of viral isoforms in lung samples, which are related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of matching and selection techniques to provide one of the genome sequences that make up 86.3% of the total virus genome.
It is also possible that the mouse is one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from the mouse as the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are related to beta-CoVs that are mouse-mediated.
Also, the interval between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is the shortest between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs that are susceptible to parasites.
The pathway of SARS-CoV-2 mutation in bats, reptiles and other animals is yet to be explained.
While strong correlation patterns have been observed in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and the mouse, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share strong genomic correlation patterns.
It is widely reported that the high frequency of RBD between SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is due to selection-dependent mutations.
Another project seeks to switch the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV from the mammalian to the RaTG13 in a third species of wildlife.
As for the cause, mutation is common in beta-CoVs.
The team is still testing for animal viruses of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the animal lineages of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Evidence of viral mutations suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the bat CoV, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in bats.
A strain of the mosquito-borne CoV known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Mountain CoV) was reportedly identified in a North American three-colored mosquito that showed close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another camel CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, while a camel strain was suspected of carrying the virus.
To clarify, the knowledge available on the animals known to have transmitted HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of viral mutations has provided evidence for historical transmission between HCoV species.
When HCoV-OC43 was isolated from a strain of domesticated animals in the 1890s, an outbreak of respiratory illness was observed.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
A bacterial alpha-CoV similar to HCoV-229E has been identified.
Among them is the alpha-CoV that is found in the urine.
The majority of evidence supports the idea that the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans.
First, nonresidents often meet with a number of bugs in shared accommodations.
However, humans are the most likely to encounter the arpagas.
Second, HCoV-229E is related to the influenza alpha-CoV and is not pathogenic to influenza, whereas the influenza alpha-CoV is caused by respiratory infections in animals.
Finally, the arupaga alpha-CoV was detected in the wild.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the arugula was infected with HCoV-229E related to the alpha-CoV in humans.
In short, the parasites are responsible for transmitting the measles virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus to humans.
Therefore, it is not uncommon for bacteria to be able to transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
In contrast, where alpha-CoVs are the HCoV-229E gene family, macaques and camels may have evolved the virus and transmitted the virus to humans, similar to MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of cross-species transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The mutations of the MERS-CoV strain in bats were known when they were first identified and confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is evident that cockroaches are a major group of animal viruses in gene transfer and animal-to-animal transmission.
Longevity, coexistence, close proximity and the ability to fly are the factors that make cockroaches the best 'virus-spreading' animals.
On the other hand, it has been several years since the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to camels.
He has adapted the camels from being a predator to a safe and natural host of viruses.
MERS-CoV is a mild pathogen and slowly mutates in these animals.
Transmission to humans is accidental and humans are not susceptible to MERS-CoV as its transmission is slow.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of mosquitoes, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is variable.
In particular, mammalian beta-CoV is highly pathogenic to mammals.
They may be related to the SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV but are not transmissible like the SARS-CoV twins.
It is highly likely that animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans may or may not be confirmed in future studies.
First, the parasites may be a strain of SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is identical to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
People can share shelter with the villagers by cutting and mining coal.
Second, mammals may be among the most virulent and virulent animals to be recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 related viruses.
Humans are infected by the bite and ingestion of wild animal flesh.
Several mammals including domestic animals are likely to be suspected of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of domestic and wild animals have found that they have antibodies to the virus.
Third, the reported mutations and adaptations of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third animal species exposed to mosquitoes and camels.
The search for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is ongoing.
In addition to the different strains of the host, three factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating the transmission of CoV to other strains of animals.
First, it is a very high rate of mutation in the synthesis of other RNA molecules.
Compared to other single RNA viruses, the average or higher CoV mutation rate is ~10-4 per year for every 2 genes, depending on the adaptation stage of the CoV in the newly introduced species.
CoVs have an RNA-modifying enzyme, which clogs its components to cause severe mutations that can be debilitating or even non-existent.
Interestingly, at the molecular level, Remdesivir is known to inhibit the production of other CoVs by an enzyme that inhibits the production of RNA polymerase protein.
Remdesivir is one of the promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that has been clinically evaluated.
However, the variation of CoVs is almost one million times greater than in the animals in which the virus grows.
And, mutations are often higher when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host animals.
In comparison to highly variable SARS-CoV, the lower variation of SARS-CoV-2 is more noticeable, which makes it more familiar to humans.
It is said that he had already become acquainted with another animal very close to man.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to living in camels.
Therefore, it is unlikely that a genetic mutation would cause the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and anti-viral drugs to fail anytime soon.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs uses alternate transcriptional pathways in the transgenome to modify and modify the host cell; thus, increasing the chance of mutation in the host, which is beneficial in the development of new CoV viruses when appropriate.
This is supported by the structure of the protein-forming RNA and its function in the 3rd phase of the genome.
Third, CoVs also often mutate into other RNAs through the process of genome modification.
In the host animal, genome mutations occur frequently when the CoV RNA is transferred to the host cell.
Very similar RNAs with additional genomes can modify the base protein to produce new CoVs.
Natural viral mutations have been identified in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and zoonotic CoVs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 are present in bats.
Animal-viral interactions are involved in transmission
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, viral interactions with their host animals are another factor in the transmission of infection between different species.
Thus, the mutation of SARS-CoV is considered a viable model, which has also shown selective targeting of the virus in animal-to-animal transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human and mouse SARS-CoV, it is thought that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly to different host organisms, particularly to RBD mutations of the S protein.
In general, RBD in the S protein of the CoV virus is associated with a receptor receptor and is selected for its resistance to intron antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located at the 318th to 510th position of the S1 amino acid chain, which makes it bind to human ACE2 and is the primary entry point for the virus.
SARS-CoV RBD can detect ACE2 receptor viruses in a variety of animals, including chickens, mice, rats, and rabbits, which allows the animals to transmit the virus.
In summary, only 6 amino acid residues were identified as distinct from RBD in humans and mice and 4 of these contained a binding domain for the ACE2 receptor.
The twin SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase binding to the S protein and the ACE2 human receptor.
In other words, conversion of the two amino acids may be essential for the virus to adapt to the human body.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 is receptor-positive by the same receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein suggests that the association of the S protein to ACE2 in humans may have been modified.
In fact, cryo-EM studies indicate a 10 - 20 times greater association of human ACE2 to the SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also of interest to determine whether other receptor subtypes are used in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but to a different S protein.
There are other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N of HCoV-229E, and sialic acid with acetyl 9-O of HCoV-OC43.
It may explain how CoVs adapt to the body of an infected person or animal.
In addition to the host genes, the transmission of HCoVs in animals is also regulated by the host environment and the anti-virus protein.
The differences in the viral growth proteins between humans and animals that make up the HCoV genome such as bats, camels and bats can prevent transmission of the virus between different species.
HCoVs mutate local genes and destroy the anti-viral protein to infect other animals.
Thus, the molecular components of this complex virus-parasite interaction need to be further characterized and explained.
A random genome analysis of the viral growth site and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein using the state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be successful.
The emergence of a new HCoV: its origin
The majority of the CoVs in bats present a high probability of the emergence of a new HCoV.
Thus, the bat CoV is the gene source for HCoVs.
And rapid mutation and gene mutation that cause HCoV mutation are two key steps in this process.
For example: The acquisition or loss of protein-producing genes has the potential to dramatically alter the pathogenicity of a virus.
In SARS-CoVs, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, and SARS-CoV-related mosquito viruses that have been isolated appear to produce a different ORF8 protein.
The 29th SARS-CoV variant was identified in the early human genome.
This gene codes for ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be capable of adapting to mutations in animals.
And SARS-CoV is known to mutate genes in alpha and gamma-CoV strains, with a large number of mutated genes being encoded in RNA polymerase proteins.
The standard deviation is also seen in nsp9, most of nsp10, and some of nsp14.
In one case, MERS-CoV mutated the baseline between two different strains of the virus in Saudi camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, gene mutation activity has also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs mutate the genes of other animal CoVs into their own specific genes.
It should be noted that non-natural selection can contribute to unintended mutations in the viral genome, which can lead to the virus being isolated from the target area, such as the immune system of the host animal.
An example of this is the absence of a normal ORF4 gene in HCoV-229E, which results in the deletion of the true genome.
While a strong ORF4 was found in HCoV-229E-associated strains of the virus, the alpha-CoV of the arupaga shows intrusion by a single genome, resulting in mutation.
Finally, the mutation of new HCoVs is also due to the longevity problems of mammals.
Only mild or no symptoms were detected when the bats were infected with CoV, indicating an adaptation between the CoV and the bats.
It is clear that the mosquitoes are highly adapted to the CoVs in terms of biology.
For example: Inadequate immunity molecules in cockroaches effectively reduce the spread of CoV infections.
And natural antibodies in the larvae have been discontinued due to the addition of NKG2/CD94 receptor and the lack of expression of the type I tissue-binding molecule.
And, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from multiple metabolic processes can inhibit the spread of CoVs and affect the repair of gene-modifying enzymes, thus selectively pathogenicising the virus when introduced into new species.
Other genes that cause CoVs also mutate, creating a new protein or subunit that allows the animal to adapt to the virus.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs do not cause mild illness or symptoms in nesting animals such as bats and camels.
They evolve rapidly without significant resistance from the body's growing immune system.
This is the secret to why infected animals do not show symptoms and cause severe illness in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to over-activation of the immune system and the release of too many cytokines, the stronger the immune system and the more lung damage.
This is in contrast to asymptomatic animals, where the immune system is activated by the mutant CoV.
Isolation of antibodies may be useful in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Antiviral proteins are strong in the larvae.
Thus, the provision of an anti-virus type I protein at least before SARS-CoV-2 infection would be beneficial.
The NLRP3 antiviral protein is also inactive in the larvae.
According to these hypotheses, inhibition of NLRP3 protein with MCC950 activity could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the evolution of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the mouse beta-CoV has been shown to share 95% of the same genomes with SARS-CoV, it shares 96% of the same genomes with SARS-CoV-2.
While mice and other marketed animals have been found to be infected with SARS-CoV, no SARS-CoV-2 strain has been identified.
A reptile beta-CoV was found to be very similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that reptiles may be a predator or that reptile beta-CoV is one of the genes that bind to SARS-CoV-2.
Although questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally introduced by humans.
CoVs have been re-introduced due to the recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
Research on CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly altered our understanding of the HCoV-carrying animals that infect humans.
There is strong evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from the common cold and are transmitted to humans through their host animals.
The fact that SARS-CoV infections originate from human and mouse interactions in animal markets, closing them and killing the infected mice would effectively prevent the SARS outbreak.
Mammals should also be removed from animal markets to prevent transmission to other animals, according to research on the origin of the closely related SARS-CoV-2 mammalian beta-CoV.
However, the human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mammals and other mammals is yet to be fully understood in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been present in camels.
These camels are important transportation animals and provide meat, milk, fur and wool for clothing to the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Thus, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to combat MERS, as has been done in animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the recurrence of MERS, the development of a MERS-CoV vaccine must be combined with other preventive measures.
If we cannot eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause epidemics.
Various CoVs are present in wild animals.
In particular, the CoVs in the larva have different potencies.
In the future, it is highly likely that animal-transmitted CoVs will mutate, leading to the emergence of new, highly infectious or potentially lethal CoVs.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be stopped to avoid unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In view of the ongoing challenges posed by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a comprehensive strategy to combat these viruses is needed.
In short, the world has been in a state of viral decline for a long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to escape.
Although mosquitoes have many characteristics that allow them to spread the virus, the risk of human contact with mosquitoes and other species of wildlife can be reduced if humans are trained to avoid them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the habitat of CoVs and their hosts, which is useful for preventing animal transmission to humans and preventing future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal viruses is to understand the vulnerability of the virus and the animals it infects.
There are still many animal strains of SARS-CoV-2 that are not known.
First, if the parasites infect the parasites with the virus that causes SARS-CoV-2, it is interesting to see why parasites and parasites are in the same habitat.
Second, if the parasite infects humans directly, the human exposure to the parasite should be documented.
Third, if the third mammal is actually a predator, how it interacts with different species of animals such as humans, reptiles and mammals must be understood.
Finally, in cases where a large number of mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, follow-up and transmission should be undertaken.
Whether it is a tick, a mammal or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its vector viruses will be more likely to be found in mammals in the future.
Further studies in these animals will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will play a major role in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the screening guidelines for COVID-19 suspected and confirmed is essential
On 6 February 2020, our team published an expedited guideline containing recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV), and the guidelines provided us with experience and provided a better understanding of how to combat the pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge of it is gradually improving based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually being updated.
In this letter, we have responded to one of our guidelines and provided new testing guidelines for the screening of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 according to the latest screening and treatment guidelines (stage 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed emergency advisory guidelines and published them on the Military Medical Research website on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted a lot of attention.
However, it is important to recognize that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, published seven volumes with some significantly modified sections.
Our guideline then adopted the idea of Zhou and others, who developed a simplified method of scoring based on clinical experience.
Their work has added new concrete evidence to our line of thought and has provided useful insight into this global pandemic.
We support and commend their hard work.
However, their performance also needs to be updated in line with the latest guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (Phase VII Trials) and the latest research.
As indicated in the seventh publication (3 March 2020), confirmation of suspected cases must be matched to one of the following two epidemiological characteristics for a full diagnosis, or to three characteristics if the epidemiological history is unclear:
Outbreak history: (1) Travel or residence in Wuhan and its environs, or other COVID-19 cases reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) Contact with SARS-CoV-2 (including nucleic acid test); (3) Contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs, or other COVID-19 cases reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) Contact with prevalent cases in a particular area (more than 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms reported in 2 weeks in places such as clinics, homes, schools, offices, etc.).
Symptoms include: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) with symptoms indicating COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, no increase or decrease in baseline.
Diagnosis of confirmed infection should be based on suspected infection with one of the following pathological or blood-based symptoms: (1) a timely PCR test that detects SARS-CoV-2 infection; (2) sequencing of viral pathogens that indicate a link to a newly identified coronavirus; (3) detection of infection with specific IgM and IgG strains of SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or mutation of specific SARS-CoV-2 gene in an unreproduced patient, or an increase in one site of infection by more than 4 times during the recovery phase of the infection.
We note that time-bound respiratory nucleic acid tests or blood samples have been added to the second volume (18 January 2020) and the third volume (22 January 2020).
Diagnosis from blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); then blood-based data were added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on ongoing research into better detection of nucleic acid exposure for rapid testing, as well as respiratory samples including blood samples, which provide a variety of samples, and support the introduction of specific antibodies to the infected individual into the established protocols.
In addition, there are numerous warning signs for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
For this reason, the table of Zhou et al. needs to be updated, as they classify a person without symptoms as "minimal risk".
Score systems should also be monitored in other clinical and research activities.
Finally, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to comment.
Regarding the screening of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we request that they follow and comply with the new guidelines of their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest number in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on the same day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a total of 114 cases and 33 recoveries.
The total death toll is 17.
In a report circulated online, IEDCR Director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that among the dead were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two of the deceased were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also announced that two of the victims had come from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, the country's leading newspaper, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the head of Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Sunday, in a video announcement posted online, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport Obaidul Quader said that public transport has been suspended for longer than planned until Saturday.
This travel ban was scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic goods including medicines, fireworks and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on 8 March, in two people who had returned from Italy and one of them was a woman.
As of March 9, all three patients had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than a million people worldwide
The total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand people have died from COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The figure was announced on the same day Malawi reported its first coronavirus case and Zambia's first coronavirus death.
On Thursday, North Korea announced that it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 infections in the 24 hours leading up to 10 a.m. central European time (08:00 GMT) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus have been reported, with 5,900 deaths.
According to Johns Hopkins University, CBS News reported 1,000 deaths from the coronavirus in the United States on Wednesday.
Worldwide, countries have announced strong measures to contain the spread of the epidemic.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the curfew to May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament extended the state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to a full day; previously it was from 15:00 to 06:00.
Thailand plans to introduce curfew between 22:00 and 04:00.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that his administration has extended the curfew to May 1.
Australian stores set a limit on the amount of toilet paper a person is allowed to buy
On Saturday night, Australia's Woolworths and Coles stores reduced the number of toilet paper to two and one pack of toilet paper per person in each of the stores nationwide.
On Monday, ALDI also announced that one pack should be limited.
The limits were announced as messages at the checkout point, and on the Facebook pages of the stores.
It was reported that consumers were buying the toilet paper in bulk due to fears of COVID-19 when quarantining was necessary.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also reduced the number of toilet paper items in household packaging to one pack per order.
The subsequent changes would have limited the number of packages of four toilet paper sets available from Woolworths and Coles stores on March 4 and 5.
In a March press release, Coles said that under the guidelines of not more than one pack of four toilet paper, "many stores are running out of supplies after an hour of replacement", and said that such purchases "have never happened", while ALDI said on Facebook on Tuesday that this was "unexpected".
Sales have "surged" in the past week, according to a spokesperson for Woolworths.
Costco in Canberra also reduced the number of packages of toilet paper to two last week.
To further reduce the shortage of toilet paper, Coles ordered larger packages from retailers and increased the frequency of ordering, and Woolworths ordered more toilet paper, while ALDI stockpiled the merchandise for the Wednesday promotion that was sold earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, said that retailers could increase supply, but the regulations for truckloads set by the local council made it difficult.
He believes that prices will rise, while retailers try to meet customer needs and give them less promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to early stock outs, some stores will not be able to offer Wednesday's promotion.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, marketing expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are stocking goods at night.
He also claimed that clean paper is a packaged product, which makes it scarce in stores and leaves a lot of space on shelves when it is sold out, adding to the feeling of being out of stock.
Russell Zimmerman of ABC News: "Coles and Woolworths believe that having more products on the shelves like toilet paper and pesticides in bulk would reduce the fear of people".
Who Gives a Crap, which processes used toilet paper, said the stock was stolen last Wednesday.
News.com.au reports that Kimberly-Clark, a manufacturer of Kleenex and Solaris Paper, a manufacturer of Sorbent, have both insisted on working 24/7 to keep up with the market.
Domain.com, a real estate website, announced that real estate agents would also offer free cleaning certificates to first-time homebuyers in Melbourne, where the tower was used sparingly as buyers had a workday that coincided with the weekend.
Thursday's issue of NT News, a daily newsletter in Darwin, added eight pages that can be cut and used as a clean sheet.
Stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report, which said they did not plan to impose restrictions on purchases.
Other products that were also popular, says Russell Zimmerman, included masks, pesticides, dry foods, hand soap, and flour.
The same was true outside Australia, where on Sunday night the British online retailer Ocado reduced Andres's toilet paper to just two packs of 12.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to be a pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" refers primarily to the spread of the disease, not specifically its severity, WHO has stressed the need for governments to intervene in its response:
"All countries can change the direction of the pandemic.
"Countries have identified, tested, treated, quarantined, isolated contacts and promoted prevention", says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned about the rapid spread and spread of the epidemic and the lack of action taken to control it.
For Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director General of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic "has never happened".
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said: "Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has surpassed its exposure and become a global pandemic".
Ghebreyesus also joined the discussion, where he said: "We have not seen a coronavirus outbreak".
He continues, "We have not seen a pandemic that can be effectively fought".
The pandemic development follows the WHO's January decision to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of global concern.
"It is clear that the pandemic is making things worse", said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director general of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that at least 126,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 of those dying.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the current outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the highly pathogenic influenza-causing coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
In December 2019, an outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China; on 30 January 2020, it was declared a public health emergency of global concern, and on 11 March 2020, it was declared an epidemic.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million people had been infected with COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, with nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The global mortality rate is 4% in China, while it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.8% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Severe symptoms include nausea and severe respiratory problems.
Symptoms usually begin within five days of exposure, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or cure for the virus.
Primary care is to treat symptoms and help prevent illness. Essential precautions include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, monitoring and quarantining people suspected of infection.
World leaders have been frustrated by the pandemic with travel restrictions, lockdowns, curfews, workplace epidemic control and closures.
The pandemic has disrupted economic and social activities, postponed or halted sports, religious, political and cultural activities and caused a global shortage of goods caused by mass consumer fears.
Schools and universities were closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Rumors of the virus also spread online, with reports of violence or discrimination against foreigners, especially Chinese, East and Southeast Asians, and others from areas affected by the virus.
Due to reduced travel and the closure of major industries, air pollution and air pollution have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of influenza with unknown causes, and in early January 2020 the testing began.
The cases are related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market, where the virus is suspected to have originated from animals.
The virus that caused the pandemic known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus similar to the coronavirus in bats, rodents and SARS-CoV. The first known case of the virus was reported on December 1, 2019, and the patient had no contact with the zoo.
The first cases were reported in December 2019, with two-thirds of them being related to the source.
On 3 March 2020, unconfirmed reports by the South China Morning Post reported that the case, which was identified on 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, may be the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections were decreasing in China but increasing sharply in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding new cases in China for the first time.
There may be many unreported cases; especially those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, the lowest number of cases among adolescents has been reported, with those under 19 accounting for 2.4% of the global cases.British government scientific adviser Patrick Vallance says that 60% of the UK population may be infected before getting vaccinated.
Cases are the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed according to government protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and several countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have introduced guidelines not to test those with mild symptoms.
The study published on 16 March showed that as of 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 cases in China had not been detected, with 79% of the cases being unreported.
Statistical analysis released on 30 March showed that the number of cases in Italy was higher than reported.
The number of new infections (R0) of COVID-19 would range from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure could be 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 patients recover.
For non-treated patients, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, but the most common is 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 97,000 people have died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of the deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The government-reported deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic were mainly for people who tested positive for COVID according to government protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher than reported, as it does not include untested deaths, e.g. deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Some data from Italy suggest that the current death toll from the pandemic is higher than the official estimate of COVID deaths by 4-5 times.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: "We know that the reported death toll is not consistent with the actual death toll, which is consistent with reports that the United States is not responding to the pandemic. This is often during pandemic times, such as during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed case of the pandemic was reported on January 9, 2020.
On 1 February, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside of China, more than a dozen people in Iran, South Korea and Italy had died.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.Multiple measures are being used in various locations to count deaths.
The figures vary by region and time, and are based on measurements taken, medical practices, treatment, post-epidemic time and population conditions such as age, gender, and overall health.The average death rate among infected individuals is the number of deaths minus the number of infections over a period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the average death rate among infected patients was 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by region.
In China, the average death rate among infected individuals decreased from 17.3% (symptomatic cases on January 1, 2020) to 0.7% (symptomatic cases after February 1, 2020).Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which indicates the proportion of infected individuals who died from the disease, and the infection rate (IFR), which indicates the proportion of infected individuals (whether tested or not) who died from the disease.
The statistics are not randomized and track specific individuals from infection to recovery or death.
Many universities have tried to count these specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Symptomatic Medicine estimates the overall prevalence of the disease to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above figures are in line with the results of the first COVID-19 test of vaccinated people in Germany and the study's mortality rate based on the test results.
WHO says the epidemic is preventable.
The prevalence and duration of the epidemic are not well understood and may vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: "Without control, pathogens often come and go in a limited way and then begin to decline when the disease is no longer contagious.
But it is difficult to predict the end of the season.
"The epidemic may be over by June", said Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government's chief medical adviser, "when all countries have complied with WHO guidelines to contain the spread of the epidemic".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 will move from one location to another, possibly for a year or two.
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, quarantine and other measures should be observed "until a vaccine is available (18 months or longer)".
"I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's so contagious, will go extinct", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, "and that it could become a seasonal disease, recurring every year".
The return of this highly contagious virus will be driven by human immunity and viral mutations.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be unique and infected individuals may not show symptoms.
The most common symptoms were fever (88%) and cough (68%).
Uncommon symptoms include fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, bloody cough, diarrhea, or blue skin. WHO reports that approximately one in six people will be infected with the virus and develop respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies symptoms that include difficulty breathing, chest pain or tingling, sudden dizziness, difficulty waking, sore eyes or lips, and advises immediate medical attention if symptoms do not resolve. If the disease progresses, it can lead to diarrhea, severe respiratory distress, bleeding, internal acid reflux, and death.
When some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, while no symptoms are present and test results are positive, researchers recommend that close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be monitored and tested for infection.
China reports a low prevalence of asymptomatic cases to 44%.
The average time to manifest symptoms (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; usually a few days.A dubious example is the number of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell from 30% to 15%.
Some of the information on the transmission of the disease is not well understood.
It is thought that the disease is primarily transmitted by close contact with the fluids that come from coughing, sneezing, or being within 1 to 2 meters of another person.
Studies have shown that uncovered coughing can cause fluid to move from 15 to 20 feet [4.5 to 8.2 m] away.
Others suggest that the virus may be transmitted by long-term respiratory fluids, which may be released when a person speaks. Respiratory fluids can also be released when a person breathes out while speaking, which is primarily a respiratory virus.
The fluid may fall into the mouth or nose of people in close proximity or inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as pulmonary resuscitation and CPR can allow the respiratory fluid to be absorbed into the air and the disease to spread through the air.
It can be spread by contact with infected areas such as the skin and contact with the face, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted via sunlight, these risks are thought to be minimal.
The Chinese government denied that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted from infected saliva and through the infected mouth.The virus is most transmissible within the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can spread before symptoms appear and during severe illness.
People who are diagnosed within three days of showing symptoms may be infected before showing any significant symptoms.
There have been a few reports of asymptomatic cases that are only laboratory confirmed, but asymptomatic infections have been detected in some countries during contact tracing testing.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) reports that it is not clear how easily a disease can be transmitted, with one infected person potentially infecting two or three others.
In particular, the virus can survive for up to three days on plastic material (porporopyrene) and 304 days on stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four days on copper.
However, it varies depending on temperature and humidity.Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals and after touching a person who may have been infected.
The highly pathogenic influenza coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, isolated from three people who had a measles infection related to the outbreak of the Wuhan flu pandemic.
All forms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are identical to the coronavirus.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that is crushed and covered with a coating.The SARS-CoV-2 virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV derivative virus.
It is thought to have originated from animals.
Genetic analysis has identified the coronavirus as belonging to the same group as the Betcoronavirus, which is in the family of the Sarbecoviruses (B family) and both originated from bats.
It is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) genomes.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found a single amino acid difference in genome structure between the virus from mammals and the virus from humans.
To date, comparison of all genomes has shown up to 92% of the genome of the mammalian coronavirus with SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to confirm that mammals were the first to be infected.
Viral infection can be diagnosed on a case-by-case basis, while definitive confirmation is expected by laboratory RT-PCR of contaminated tissue or CT scans.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan found that CT is more accurate in detecting viral patterns than PCR, although it is not well defined, some of the characteristics of this laboratory method have been linked to other tests for influenza and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology states that: CT should not be used for screening or as a primary method of testing for COVID-19.
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing of SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses the real-time rRT-PCR laboratory method.
Testing may be done on samples taken from the respiratory tract or blood.
Usually, responses are available within a few hours to days.
This test is usually performed using a nasal swab, although nasal swabs may also be used.Many laboratories and companies are developing blood tests that also detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these methods have been shown to provide reliable measurements for widespread use.
In the United States, the Cellex blood test is approved as a preventive measure but is only used by licensed laboratories.
Radiography and CT scans are used to test people who show symptoms including a lack of GGO or fluid in the lungs.
The Italian Association of Radiation Therapy is developing an international database of radiation test results from confirmed cases.
Due to similarities with other diseases such as adenovirus, PCR-confirmed test samples may not specifically detect COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT and PCR chest tests and found that while the CT scan is not a reliable diagnostic tool, it is a fast and accurate detection of viral activity, which is considered a diagnostic tool.
The CNN artificial intelligence method was developed to detect the pattern of viral images using scanning and CT scans.
Measures to control the spread of the disease generally include adequate physical hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the face, nose or mouth without washing hands, and coughing or sneezing with a towel and immediately throwing the towel away.
Those who have been infected are advised to wear a mask when in public.
Contact prevention measures are essential to prevent spread.Many governments have banned or advised people not to make non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, in many parts of the world, the virus has spread from one person to another.
This means that the virus is spreading in the population, and some of the population does not know where they were transmitted and how they were infected. Healthcare providers who would be treating a person who may have been infected are advised to follow standard precautionary measures, contact avoidance guidelines, and face protection. Tracking contacts is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones has raised privacy concerns with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing statements calling for an end to this surveillance.
Various applications were developed or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen teams of experts sought a privacy-friendly solution such as using Bluetooth technology to store data from mobile phones that had been connected.
Users receive messages if they have been in contact with a person who has been tested positive for COVID-19.There is a growing misinformation about prevention practices, such as nasal decongestants and oral laxatives, which do not kill the virus.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many companies are developing it.
Hand washing is essential to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; in particular, after using the toilet or with apparently contaminated hands, before touching food, after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
This is because when the virus is not in the body, it is killed by household soap, which has the ability to break down the virus-containing barriers.
CDC also recommends the use of a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their face, nose, or mouth with unsanitary hands.
Viral microorganisms in a variety of environments can be killed with a range of biological agents (in one minute after exposure to a stainless steel insecticide), including 62% ethanol, 50% isoporopane, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogens peroxide and 0.2% povidone iodine.
Other drugs, such as benzariconium chloride and corhexiscidine gurukonate, do not kill ticks effectively.
CDC recommends that if there is a suspicion or confirmation of COVID in an area such as an office or daycare, any area such as offices, restrooms, public areas, portable electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, desktop computers, laptops and ATMs used by patients should be disinfected.
Health authorities require people to cover their mouth and nose with a towel or a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and to immediately discard the towel.
Medical masks are the best for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask will prevent the amount and amount of fluid released when you speak, sneeze and cough.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
 According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, Wearing a mask reduces the risk of facial contact, which is the most common source of infection when hands are not cleaned properly. Masks are also used by caregivers who may be ill.
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks when they are at high risk of infection, such as in the care of someone with COVID-19, and believes that wearing masks protects people from touching their faces.
Many countries have begun to encourage their citizens to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC requires people to wear non-medical cloth masks.In particular, China requires non-infected citizens to use disposable medical masks, especially when within 1 meter of others.
Hong Kong requires people to wear medical masks when traveling or in public places.
Health authorities in Thailand would encourage people to work at home with cloth masks and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia it is illegal to go outside without a mask or nose and mouth cover.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks in public places for self-protection and protection.
The Australian government mandated that everyone entering a grocery store must wear a mask.
Israel requires all citizens to wear masks when in public.
April 1: Taiwan, which produces more than ten million masks a day, requires passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear masks.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear masks whenever you go outdoors, and requires homemade masks for those who cannot afford factory-made ones.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as social distancing) includes actions to prevent transmission to reduce the spread of the virus and to increase social distancing.
The measures include quarantines, travel bans and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shops.
Individuals may use social distancing by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding public places, using non-contact greetings, and maintaining social distancing.
Currently, many countries are mandating or asking people in areas of epidemic concern to avoid contact with each other.
The maximum number of people required by US government agencies and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 (when no COVID-19 cases were known to be present in the area) to 50, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people. Older adults and those with other conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immunodeficiency disorder at high risk for disease and health problems were advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible if they are susceptible to contagion. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations began to use the term "contact avoidance" to describe "personal distancing", meaning that the focus is on preventing contact while maintaining a clear distance between people.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to a sense of isolation, rather than encouraging people to remain in contact with others through other means.Some agencies have issued guidelines for healthy sexual behavior during the pandemic.
The guidelines state that you should only have sex with your partner, who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Home quarantine is mandatory for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or suspected infection.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued detailed guidelines on effective self-quarantine.Many countries have mandated or required that all people living in areas where infection is common quarantine.
Strict self-quarantine instructions were given to those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with an infected person with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to infected countries or regions are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last day of possible contact.
The measures to control the epidemic are to contain or contain it and to slow its spread.
Prevention is carried out at the early stage of the outbreak and is aimed at monitoring and isolating infected individuals and introducing additional infection control measures and vaccination to prevent the disease from spreading to other populations.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of an epidemic, then efforts are made to contain the spread: measures are taken to slow the spread and minimize the impact of the epidemic on the healthcare sector and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures can be taken simultaneously.
Controlling the epidemic requires strong containment measures by reducing the number of new infections to less than 1.One component of the pandemic response is to try to contain the extreme increase in infections known as the reduction of new infections.
It reduces the problems of health services being overwhelmed by the number of patients and provides sufficient time to seek out vaccines and treatments.
Non-invasive measures include containment of the epidemic through personal precautions such as sanitation, masks, and self-quarantine; community containment measures such as school closures and mandatory closures; public awareness and response; and environmental measures such as mass cleaning. Other major containment measures were taken in China as the epidemic began to re-emerge, such as urban containment and strict travel restrictions.
Other countries have also taken various measures to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun mass testing and quarantining of certain areas and has announced travel for infected individuals.
Singapore has funded the quarantines and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and punished those who steal medical supplies.The United Kingdom and the United States have also shown that both containment (reducing the number of infections without stopping the spread of the disease) and containment (reducing the number of new infections) have been challenging.
Measures to reduce infection rates may reduce the extreme need for medical services by two-thirds and the number of deaths by one-half, but do not prevent tens of thousands of deaths and health services from continuing to receive large numbers of patients.
Prevention is the best course of action but should be continued as long as the virus is circulating in humans (or until a vaccine is available, depending on the previous experience), spreading and otherwise the virus will return when these measures are relaxed.
Long-term efforts to contain the epidemic are socially and economically disruptive.
There are no specific drugs approved to reduce the severity of COVID-19, but development is ongoing, including the testing of conventional antiviral drugs.
Taking flu medication without a prescription, drinking plenty of water and resting may help to reduce symptoms.
Due to the high fever, oxygen therapy, hydration and respiratory assistance are necessary.
Steroid use can be dangerous.
Several drugs that have been approved to treat other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO has stated that "traditional and home remedies can reduce the severity of symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19".
Increasing capacity and adapting to the needs of healthcare institutions in treating COVID-19 patients is defined by WHO as a key strategy to combat the pandemic.
ECDC and the WHO European Regional Office issued guidance to hospitals and primary care providers to shift focus from other services, such as focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, discontinuing unnecessary medical services, isolating and quarantining COVID-19 patients, and increasing the capacity of emergency services with physician training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are differing reports on the origin of the first infection (the first detection of the virus).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei has been increasing.
The infections were mainly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale wholesale market, which sells live animals, with other reports suggesting that the virus originated from some of these animals; in other words, it originated from animals.The patients were diagnosed with an unknown pathogen on December 26 and treated by Zhang Jixian, a physician at Hubei Provincial Hospital, according to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed colleagues of the existence of a "coronavirus-like SARS".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were questioned by the Police for spreading rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was warned by her superiors for not revealing the problem.
The Wuhan Metropolitan Health Commission issued a public statement on 31 December that provided information to WHO.
Health authorities were informed of a large number of cases of unknown influenza in Wuhan, prompting testing to begin in early January.Since the outbreak began, cases have doubled nearly every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, aided by increased travel in China and Wuhan's status as a major inter-provincial railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, government data showed 6,174 cases as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in having the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
Nearly 200 countries had at least one case.
In response to the outbreak in Europe, Schengen countries have reduced travel and introduced border controls.
Countries have implemented pandemic-control measures such as quarantines (also known as curfews) and lockdowns.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or nearly 90% of the population, were under curfew-like measures in the United States, with more than 50 million in the Philippines, nearly 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under curfew, rising to 2.6 billion two days later, nearly a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; unconfirmed reports indicate that the first case was reported on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian followed up on cases of influenza with unknown causes on December 26, and the hospital where he worked notified Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
A preliminary genetic test performed on patients on 27 December 2019 found a coronavirus-like SARS.
The general statement was released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO received the same information on the same day.
In the reporting of the incident, Wuhan medical staff were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially announced that there was no "confirmed evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government announced the launch of a massive campaign, which was later described by Communist Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Xi Jinping as "the people's fight" to stop the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest mass quarantine in human history", the travel curfew announced on 23 January suspended travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching nearly 57 million people.
Private vehicles were stopped in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of the Huoshenshan Provisional Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Other hospitals were later built, such as the Leishenshan Hospital, to treat more patients.
In addition to new hospitals being built, China has also converted 14 other buildings in Wuhan into conference facilities and stadiums for temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government issued further guidelines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including health guidelines for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures; in particular, those related to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been adopted in various regions of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transportation has been altered and Chinese museums are temporarily closed.
Public transit controls have been implemented in several cities, with an estimated 760 million people (more than half of the population) being placed under curfews.After the pandemic became widespread in March, authorities in China took strong measures to prevent the virus from "entering the country" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all foreigners entering the city.On March 23, one person in China was infected within the previous five days, returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that domestic transmission had been contained and the epidemic had been contained in China.
On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei after a two-month curfew was imposed but were maintained in Wuhan.On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that travel restrictions on visa or residence permits were suspended from 28 March onwards, without providing specific information on when the restrictions would expire.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
March 30: The Chinese government urged businesses and industries to reopen, and provided financial assistance to reopen businesses.The State Council announced a three-minute national day of mourning at 10:00 am on April 4, coinciding with the Qingming Cultural Festival, when the government urged families to pay homage to the deceased via online social networking to avoid close contact and prevent the recurrence of the COVID-19 outbreak.
On 20 January, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had arrived in South Korea from China.
On February 20, the National Health Service reported an increase in confirmed cases, largely due to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious group known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.

Several sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Championship, the 2019-20 British Championships, the 2020 European Championships, the 2019-20 United States Handball Championship, and the 2019 NHL20.
The pandemic also delayed the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; on 24 March the International Olympic Committee announced that the Games would be "postponed to no later than 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021". Gambling venues and other sports venues around the world were closed and card games such as poker tournaments were postponed and cancelled.
This has led to a shift in online gambling, with many gambling sites reporting a sharp increase in subscriptions. Entertainment has also been affected, with many bands cancelling or postponing their concert tours.
Large theaters like Broadway have shut down all entertainment.
Some artists have sought to maintain their productivity and share their work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, online concerts, or online "parties" that are attended by artists, thus promoting and even publicizing their work.
On the Internet, humorous images focusing on the coronavirus have become popular as many people seek to be entertained and distracted while they are still unaware of the direction of the situation.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as people from high-risk areas in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere.
A sense of fear, prejudice, and conflict has been evident in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and even the Asia-Pacific region.
The February reports (when most cases were still in China) showed a racial bias among groups around the world, saying that the Chinese deserved the virus or would have been punished.
Some African countries have also seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their region of origin.
There has been support for the Chinese, both in person and online, and for those in the affected areas.
As the pandemic spreads to new countries, the population of Italy, the country with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Europe, may face a crisis of self-loathing and xenophobia.People in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a letter warning other countries not to allow Chinese into their countries in order to curb the spread of the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been widely shared on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in Britain and the United States report an increase in racial violence and are subject to attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that critics consider to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuees from Ukraine and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, are studying in major Indian cities because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal branch, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese were ruining the environment "because God punished them".
This was immediately condemned by the Chinese Embassy in Kolkata, calling it "inappropriate".[22] In China, xenophobia and racism have been exacerbated by the epidemic, with foreigners being labeled "foreign trash" and should be thrown away.
Many newspapers with paid websites have removed some or all of the fees for coronavirus news.
Scientific writers have published scientific papers on the epidemic and are available to the public.
Some scientists have chosen to share their recent research findings on servers of applications such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes both viral detection and antibody recognition.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is intended for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
It is used to confirm new infections or cases.
Antibody detection (blood test) can be used both for testing and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests indicate the number of cases, including those with too few symptoms to report to the authorities or those without symptoms.
The actual number of deaths from the pandemic and the level of immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was wide variation in the number of tests conducted in all countries.
This change can also have a significant impact on death rates, possibly being more pronounced in some countries.
Using rapid reaction-to-infection (rRT-PCR) tests, testing can be done on respiratory samples obtained using a variety of methods, including a tracheostomy or nasal swab.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with urine samples is the only reliable method during the first week of infection.
The virus can then be eliminated in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For those who have tested positive within the second week, it is advisable to repeat a series of tests such as a test of the testes.
One of the most recent PCR tests was tested at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the rapid reaction-to-reaction (rRT-PCR) method with 250,000 kits donated by the World Health Organization.
The United Kingdom had also scheduled a test by 23 January 2020.On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech scheduled a clinical trial of a PCR-based (PowerChek Coronavirus) SARS-CoV-2 detection device.
E-cell detection is carried out by the human coronavirus strain, and the RdRp gene is detected in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to be approved by the National Institute of Medical Devices to use PCR-based SARS CoV-2 detectors.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is deploying RT-PCR Diagnostic kits for the detection of the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) in public laboratories through Reagent International Resource.
One of three cell-cell-specific tests in an earlier version of the diagnostic toolkit resulted in poor results due to the inadequate medication used, and testing difficulties at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of 100 tests per day being successfully tested throughout February 2020.
Two-stage testing was not expected to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization.Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing.
Quest Diagnostics also made nationwide COVID-19 testing available as of March 9, 2020.
No limit has been set; collection and processing of samples taken must be done according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and is being developed by the State Institute for Viral Research and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the Federal Health Service began testing for the virus. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that the Mayo Clinic had developed a device that could detect the COVID-19 outbreak. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was granted FDA approval to develop a virus test that would provide results in a maximum of 3.5 hours, allowing one machine to test 4,128 people in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received emergency clearance from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA approved a test using the nucleic acid thermal enhancement technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of heat exchangers, the system can provide a positive result in about five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbot plans to increase capacity to 50,000 tests per day.In Taiwan, a test using N-type antibodies to coronavirus is underway, and it is hoped that it will provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid flu test.
In March 2020, research papers concluded that "in the beginning, chest X-rays are of little use in diagnosis, and CT scans may be available before symptoms develop".
The features of CT scanning include the ability to view all sides of the lungs, with precise views of the lateral, medial and posterior parts.
Lower lung size, high pressure in some areas of the lungs increases with the progression of the disease.
A study comparing PCR and CT scans in Wuhan to determine the source of the outbreak found that the evidence suggests that the outbreak was more severe in Wuhan as it was more mixed with respiratory diseases.
As of March 2020, the US National Academy of Radiation Sciences has ordered that "The Wuhan test is no longer used for testing for CoronavirusCOVID-19". As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that PCR be used as the primary screening test.
One of the body's immunity mechanisms against infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can be useful in detecting infection in humans as early as day 7 or after initial symptoms, in assessing immunity and in conducting population monitoring. Analysis of samples can be done in a conventional laboratory (CLT) or other dedicated testing facility (PoCT).
The mass-testing data in many medical laboratories will be used for analysis, but the availability of results will depend on the speed of the process.
In conventional laboratories, a single sample of collected blood is usually used, although a series of samples may be used to monitor immunity.
At another site, a single sample of normal blood is obtained after a perforation of the skin.
Unlike PCR, pre-exposure prophylaxis is not required before testing.On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced 29 companies that notified it as required and can now provide antibody tests that have been performed.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for use with emergency authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostic received European approvals for their diagnostic devices, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood tests.
The detection capability can reach hundreds of tests in a matter of hours and is much faster than the standard PCR test for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected within 14 days of the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that no antibody testing equipment had been purchased and none could be used adequately.
Hong Kong has introduced a system whereby anyone suspected of being infected can stay at home, with the emergency department providing a "targeted kit", which is then disassembled and returned to the patient for a later response.The UK National Health Service (NHS) has announced plans to introduce home testing for suspected infections, which will eliminate the risk of the patient spreading the virus to others while in hospital, or requiring the patient to be vaccinated in the car.
The vehicle testing facility has enabled South Korea to perform some of the fastest and most extensive tests in the world.In Germany, the Medical Insurance Association announced on 2 March that it has a capacity of nearly 12,000 tests per day using emergency equipment and that around 10,700 tests were performed in the previous week.
The cost is covered by the health insurance if the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total testing capacity of 160,000 people per week.
As of 19 March, testing was conducted in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only cases were reported.
The first laboratory study reported that at least 483,295 people had been tested in the week of 12/2020, including the 12/2020 sample, of which 33,491 (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam hospitals have developed and tested a system for testing 64 patients simultaneously, where they take samples and repeat the tests later if someone is infected.In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter emergency laboratory called "Huo-Yan" 火眼 in Chinese, or "The Eye of Fire" in English, was officially opened on 5 February 2020 by the BGI, which can grow more than 10,000 people per day.
The construction work was supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasted for 5 days, samples taken showed that infections in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the cost of quarantine would have doubled if this testing capability had not been available.
Wuhan laboratory was soon followed by Huo-Yanmu laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in all 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, a total of 50,000 tests are being performed per day.The fast and user-friendly method developed by Origami Assays can test 1,122 COVID-19 patients using only 93 tests.This standardized method can be performed in small laboratories without the need for chemical processing robots.
As of March, the shortage and lack of English laboratory drugs has been a major barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some authors to write about the testing process where it is necessary to heat the test to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to produce the test cells.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates had the highest population testing capacity of any country, with the country planning to test almost all of its population.
This was due to the combination of the ability to test people in their cars, and the purchase of multiple simultaneous testing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on Huo-Yan's rapid testing laboratories).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory can perform more than 10,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of its kind in the world to operate outside of China.
Different testing methods covering different aspects of the coronavirus's characteristics have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has approved a German proposal to manufacture equipment for developing countries that cannot afford to do so.
On 17 January 2020, the Germans announced their own system, the system developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was no longer available until 28 January, leading to delays in testing in the United States.China and the United States had concerns about the quality of the available testing equipment, and these countries along with Australia were unable to meet the market for the equipment they had and to comply with the advice of medical experts.
However, experts say that South Korea's expanded testing system has helped slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, especially in private laboratories, have been built up over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on countries to increase the number of tests and related programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for diagnostic equipment due to the spread of the virus, which has left many of them out of the reach of U.S. laboratories, has created a serious problem in providing the necessary equipment and medicines for the treatment of the pandemic.
In March 2020 China announced that there were concerns about the quality of its testing equipment.
In the United States, equipment developed by the National Center for Disease Control was defective, and the government removed barriers to independent testing.Spain purchased equipment from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, a Chinese company but found it to be of poor quality.
The institute explained that incorrect results can be due to improper sampling or improper use of equipment.
The Spanish ministry said that they would remove the false-results devices from the market and replace them with products made by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the devices the Czech Republic purchased from China gave false-results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million devices from China that were found to be of poor quality.
Prime Minister Matovič wanted the test kits to be dumped into the Danube. Turkish Health Minister Ateş Kara said the test kits purchased from China were of poor quality and should not be used. The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but recently announced in April 2020 that they were unusable.
Testing, followed by quarantine and tracing of contacts with SARS-CoV-2 infections, was successful.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vò, where the first COVID-19 case in Italy occurred, doubled the population of about 3,400 people over a ten-day period.
About half of those who tested positive were asymptomatic, and all those who tested positive were quarantined.
Restrictions on travel to other regions have effectively halted the spread of the new epidemic.
Due to strict surveillance of contacts, restrictions on movement, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore was relatively low compared to other developed countries and was achieved without the complete closure of restaurants and shops.
Most activities were suspended, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holidays on 23 March.
Many countries that have also responded to the pandemic are implementing contact tracing, restricting domestic travel, testing, quarantine, and moderate home confinement, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics show that countries with high test rates, relative to mortality, have low mortality rates, perhaps because those countries are better able to identify those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that lack testing capacity and laboratory capacity for COVID-19 send their samples of the first five positive cases and the first ten positive cases of COVID-19 to 16 WHO model laboratories for validation.
Of the 16 model laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Infected as % of tested" may vary depending on national testing policies.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher rate of infection in the tested population than a country that tests the entire population, whether symptomatic or not, unless otherwise specified.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands to remove dirt, oil, germs, or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing at "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases such as measles, cholera, which are transmitted through the urinary tract.
People can contract respiratory diseases such as the common cold or flu if, for example, they do not wash their hands before touching their face, nose, or mouth (i.e., the organs that are infected).
The five key times of the day when hand washing with soap is necessary include: before and after washing, after giving a baby a hand or changing a diaper, before feeding a baby, before eating, and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hand washing can be done with a washcloth.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the baby's towel or after cleaning the baby after using a toilet.
After coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, feeding it, or cleaning its waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene in medical practice.
Hand washing before administering medicine or before caring for a patient can prevent or significantly reduce the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of medical handwashing is to clean hands that have been contaminated with infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens) and chemicals that may cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also a virtue that should be shared by all.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing other causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory diseases; and reducing the risk of heart disease.
And they reduce the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that proper hand washing can contribute to the healthy development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child deaths from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced with simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple approach can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Handwashing practices can reduce about one third of diarrheal cases and this is equivalent to providing clean water to low-income communities.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea-related illnesses can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory illness (ARI), and should be a practice in homes, schools and the wider family.
Diabetes, the most serious respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death among children under five, claiming the lives of some 1.8 million children each year.
Both smallpox and measles kill some 3.5 million children each year.
Based on data from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), regular use of soap before and after eating and using a facial mask can save more lives than any vaccine or other treatment, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory diseases by a quarter.
Hand washing is often included as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) system.
Hand washing also prevents skin diseases that are spread through contact with others.
A minor side effect of handwashing is that frequent handwashing can cause skin damage due to excessive dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause nausea, a skin condition commonly known as hand-skin infections, which is common among healthcare workers.
Excessive hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times of day when hand washing with soap is essential to reduce urinary and oral infections: after using the urinal (coughing, coughing), after breathing (changing the diaper), before feeding, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other areas where handwashing should be used to prevent infection include before and after treating a wound or ulcer; after urinating, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching feces.
In many countries, there is a low standard for hand washing with soap.
A handwashing study conducted in 54 countries in 2015 found an average of 38.7% of households used soap to wash their hands.A 2014 study found Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States had nearly 77%; and China had the lowest rate at 23%.Today there is a trend towards a shift in attitudes to encourage handwashing with soap in extreme situations.School children to wash their hands at a set daily frequency is one of the ways in developing countries to teach children handwashing.
The Health Care Initiative implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is a good example of initiatives aimed at improving children's health and education.
Two-yearly oral contraceptive doses, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride brushing, are the cornerstones of the national program.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The disinfection of the skin is enhanced by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main benefit of soaps and cleaning products is to reduce anti-wrinkle agents and increase the effectiveness of the cleaning.
Water alone does not cleanse the skin properly because oils and fats, like those found in soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleanliness, in turn, involves the use of adequate water.
Non-water soaps, because they can be recycled, can retain germs that infect the disease from previous users.
A small number of studies have examined the infectious effects of contaminated soap and found that contamination is impossible because the bacteria are removed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) still recommends that "soap-water and soap-free soap-water are the best options".
Antibacterial soap has been highly praised by people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antibiotics or antibiotics is effective against known antibiotic resistance.
However, insecticidal soaps contain pesticides such as triclosan, which has a large list of insecticides that are resistant to cultivation.
Thus, even if antibiotics are not selected from the antibiotics, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to protecting the environment and the skin, the products may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) such as hydrogens, antibacterial benzoic acid, and other skin protective agents (carotene, starch, menthol, and other herbal products). An in-depth analysis by the University of Oregon School of General Medicine found that conventional soaps have the same anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties as hand soaps.
Warm water used for handwashing is not hot enough to kill germs.
Infectious organisms grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing contaminants from soil and natural oils.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water does not reduce the amount of germs on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a hand sanitizer without water.
In the late 1990's and early 21st century, handwashing with disinfectants (commonly known as alcohol hand sanitizers) became popular and widespread.
Most are made from isopropyl or ethanol alcohols that are either carbomerised in a liquid or added to a liquid such as kerosene to form a solvent or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effects of alcohol on the body.
Addition of open hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial resistance.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol can be effective at killing bacteria.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers kill pathogens, resistant strains (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, mumps, flu, and hepatitis) as well as hepatitis.
Hand sanitizers have a 70% elimination rate of 99.97% (3.5 reduction, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of hand bacteria within 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 reduction) of hand bacteria within 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizers are highly effective at fighting infectious bacteria but have a low resistance to viruses.
Hand sanitizers appear to be ineffective against Norwalk virus, which is a common cause of gastrointestinal infections.Hand sanitizers should be used in a way that they are either irritating or spread to both hands.
The front and back of the hands and the middle and ends of each finger are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until water, foam or detergent is dry.
It is important to wash your hands thoroughly and wrap them around both hands.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand sanitizer especially when hands are apparently contaminated.
The continued use of this method is based on ease of use and quick elimination of pathogens; however, this method should not replace standard handwashing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless the product is added to soften or soften the skin.
This alcohol-induced dryness can be reduced or eliminated with glycogen or other skin-tolerant treatments.
In medical research, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with a skin softener have been shown to be more resistant to skin irritation than soaps or disinfectants.
Skin irritation, rashes, or allergic reactions due to alcohol in hand sanitizer are rare.
The lower risk of skin damage makes this method more popular than handwashing with soap and water.
Although effective, non-water hand sanitizers do not wash hands to remove all dirt but only the germs that contaminate.
Therefore, hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of multiple viruses, as the virus remains on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is largely dependent on the ingredients, and was previously less effective than alcohol and other alcohol-based detergents.
Recently, benzalkonium chloride products have been shown to have a persistent post-use antimicrobial response, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to produce a gradual decrease in yield after repeated use, possibly due to its gradual skin effects.
Many people who live in poverty do not have access to soap, so they use ashes or soil.
Using ashes or soil is a more effective alternative than just using water, but it is not nearly as effective as using soap.
One concern is that soil or soil is contaminated with microorganisms that could increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, dust is a disinfectant because it forms acidic substances when it comes into contact with water.
When soap is not available, the World Health Organization recommends using sand or dust.
The appropriate handwashing practices recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
Running water should be used as the water in the bottle may be contaminated, and the water temperature does not change significantly.
Wash your hands thoroughly with plenty of soap, and wash the back of the hand, between the fingers, and under the palms.
Soap cleans the skin of germs, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more safely with soap than with water alone.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
A strong hand rub creates a buildup of rubbing, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and a strong rub removes most of the bacteria.
Wash your hands thoroughly with running water.
Putting your hands in the toilet can re-infect your hands.
Wash your hands with a clean towel or air dryer.
Washed or dried hands can easily re-infect, with the most common areas being the thumb, the palm, the interpalm area, and the bottom of the palm.
The cork or the colored cork may be a host of germs.
Water softener is recommended for keeping the hands dry; very dry skin can be damaged and this increases the risk of infection.
Other simple methods can be used to facilitate hand washing when the use of soap or rubber is not available, such as spraying with a hanging straw or a metallic clay or using ash when necessary in developing countries.Where there is a water shortage (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are ways to treat water as a washcloth and other inexpensive methods.
Kandagirukarebe is a simple technique that uses a rope-mounted jacket, spraying water with the foot, and washing hands with a little soap and water.
Proper hand washing is a very important part of hand hygiene, but there is still debate about the best way to wash hands in public toilets.
Many studies show that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand sanitizer in most toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, conducted a study comparing the hygiene of towels, wipes, and hand sanitizers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air hand sanitizer, the overall amount of pathogens increased by an average of 194% on the hands and by an average of 254% in the middle of the hand.
Hand-washing with a ventilator increased the overall amount of pathogens by an average of 42% on the hands and by an average of 15% in the palms of the hands.
After hand washing and dehumidification with artificial paper, the total number of germs was reduced by an average of 76% on hand sanitizers and 77% on hand sanitizers.The researchers also conducted studies to determine the transmission between the toilet user and the surrounding environment for each type of dehumidification.
The vacuum cleaner, which also released air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), could remove contaminants from hands and other areas and potentially infect other toilet users and remove the contaminants up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot-air hand sanitizer cleans up to 0.25 meters from the metal.
Paper filters have been shown to be less transmissive.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined different methods of hand sanitization.
The following changes were observed in the number of pathogens following hand washing:
There are many manufacturers of hand sanitizers, and hand sanitizers have been compared to hand sanitizer paper.
Handwashing with a hand sanitizer is another option if you are traveling without water and soap.
Hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its usefulness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospitals.
Some electronic devices remind medical personnel to wash their hands if they forget to.
Some studies have shown that their use has reduced the rate of infection.
Medical handwashing lasts at least 15 seconds with plenty of soap and water or a foaming agent and wrap both hands together.
The hands should be folded in close proximity to each other.
If there is dirt under the glue, a special brush can remove it.
Because the germs that cause disease live in the water on the hands, it is important to wash and dry your hands thoroughly with a clean towel.
After washing hands, a paper towel should be used to close the water (and even open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands and the area they touch.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare facilities is to remove germs that can cause disease and prevent their spread.
Hand washing in clinics remains a challenge, reports The New England Journal of Medicine, where a large number of doctors and nurses often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, which leads to the spread of infectious pathogens.
One study found that handwashing and other simple practices can reduce the incidence of blood-borne diseases by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has released a document on the safe handwashing and hand sanitizer use in healthcare settings.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines issued by the institute are available on its website for public comment.
Important reforms were made by Whitby and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene, if required to specify requirements and guidelines.
The World Health Organization defines "five seasons" for hand washing:
after contact with blood/fluid
before the treatment, and
after caring for a patient. Adding disinfectants to soap (soaps that are "medicinal" or "microbial") makes hand washing helpful in killing germs.
This disinfection may be necessary before surgery or in areas with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms.To ensure proper pre-operative hand washing, it is important to have a removable rubber band, chlorhexidine or iodine detergent, a clean hand dryer after washing, and a clean hand sanitizer and other hand sanitizer.
You must remove all jewelry.
This procedure involves washing the hands and hands to the elbow, usually for between 2 and 6 minutes.
Long hand washing (about 10 minutes) is not necessary.
When washing your hands, avoid the water from the hands.
After washing your hands, wipe them with a clean cloth and wear an operating room garment.
To reduce the spread of infectious agents, it is advisable to wash or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a patient.
In a clinical study of staphylococcal infections, the majority of the benefits of handwashing were found in the first 20% of washing, with a small increase in benefits when handwashing frequency was increased to over 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in more than three times the incidence of foodborne infections compared to washing with disinfectant soap. Comparison of hand sanitizer and disinfectant soap for 30 seconds, both showed that hand sanitizer use reduced contamination by 26% compared to disinfectant soap.
However, washing with soap and water is more effective than hand sanitizers to reduce the risk of A/H1N1 influenza virus and other harmful bacteria remaining on hands.Hand hygiene practices in clinics may include training staff to wash hands, increasing hand sanitizers, and providing written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this aid in a wide range of healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an important and inexpensive way to achieve good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of regular access to water, soap, or handwashing equipment in homes, schools, and workplaces is a major obstacle to achieving universal handwashing practices.
For example, in many rural areas in Africa, hand washing taps near public or private toilets are still scarce, although there are other, less expensive ways to build hand washing facilities.
However, a small number of people who wash their hands may be more likely to be affected by a customary practice of not washing their hands than by a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can make a difference in action, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term societal change.
To do this effectively, monitoring and evaluation is essential.
A review of 70 studies found community-based approaches to handwashing to be effective in increasing handwashing practices in LMICs, while social media advertising is not.One example is the promotion of handwashing in schools as a "Three-Star Approach" by UNICEF by encouraging schools to use a simple, affordable method of ensuring that students wash their hands with soap, and other hygiene products.
When the basic criteria are met, schools can go from one to three stars.
The construction of handwashing facilities may be one of the most effective ways to promote handwashing practices to reduce communicable diseases and deaths.
The International Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to encourage handwashing as a way to achieve behavioural change goals.In response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the handwashing emoji.
Few studies have shown overall handwashing effectiveness in developing countries compared to the DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting handwashing and soap was more effective than other water and sanitation practices.
The importance of handwashing in human health, particularly for vulnerable people such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of handwashing: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "innovator of nursing".
At the time, many people still thought that infectious diseases were caused by bad breath.
In the 1980s, foodborne and medical-related infections caused the US CDC to intensify its efforts to promote hand hygiene as a key measure to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to a greater understanding of the importance of hand washing with soap in preventing the transmission of these infectious diseases.
For example, large signs with the words "best way to wash your hands" are hung next to hand washing machines in public toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing one's hands" in reference to something indicates a person's unwillingness to admit his or her actions or to admit that there is a conspiracy in the act.
It originated in the biblical Book of Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, but the phrase remains in common use in English-speaking countries.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands to remove what she believes to be a stain, suggesting that she is tormented by her own sin and the actions of her husband.
It has been found that people, after remembering or thinking about inappropriate actions, try to wash their hands more often and value handwashing products more.
And those who are allowed to wash their hands after reflecting on these wrong practices tend to avoid further "cleansing" practices that involve repentance such as voluntary acts of self-denial.
Some religions require their adherents to wash their hands for hygiene and religious rituals. Hand washing, which is a religious ritual, using only water without soap and washing hands, is part of the ritual of many different religions, including the Baha'i, Hindu, Buddhist and Diamond Neutratarians in Judaism, the Ravabo in Jesus, and the Udu in Islam.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims require hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims require hand washing before and after each meal.
COVID-19 prevention measures at the workplace
COVID-19 workplace prevention measures are essential to ensure safe and healthy workplaces in the context of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Effective workplace epidemiological management measures are based on the analysis of the potential source, severity of disease in the population and the risk of COVID-19 infection among vulnerable individuals.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a low-risk occupation is one in which employees are in close contact with other employees, where basic infection prevention measures are mandated, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home when sick, respiratory and hygiene precautions, and disinfecting the workplace.
A high-risk occupation is one that involves frequent contact or contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 persons, but who may have been infected through contact with others or travel abroad.
There are general workers such as school workers, public sector workers and large-scale retailers.
Prevention of the epidemic for these workers is in addition to basic prevention measures, including adequate ventilation with air filters, respiratory protection and the availability of protective clothing for contact with COVID-19 infected persons.
OSHA recommends that healthcare workers who have been in contact with a person with or suspected of having COVID-19 are at increased risk of infection, which increases the risk when these workers are performing ventilation, taking or testing of a person with known or suspected COVID-19.
The best ways to control the spread of the disease for these workers include the use of artificial equipment such as air-conditioning rooms and artificial protective clothing for their work.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a profound impact on the workplace.
Workers may not show up for work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of infection.
The nature of trade may change, both in terms of how goods are delivered and in terms of how they are purchased (such as purchasing goods at cheaper hours or servicing or delivery by car).
Finally, the delivery of goods from areas affected by the COVID-19 outbreak may be curtailed.The prevention and response plan for infectious diseases may be used as a preventive measure.
The risk profiles are available in many workplaces and workplaces, including exposure, domestic and community risks, and the personal risks of workers due to age or chronic illness.
They also outline the key areas of disease control to address these risks and other measures that could be taken if they are not successful during an outbreak.
Prevention and control of infectious diseases can be implemented at national or regional level.
Prevention measures in certain populations include reducing transmission among workers, protecting people at high risk from other infectious diseases, maintaining business reopening and reducing the impact on other facilities in processing and disposal.
The prevalence of poverty in the business community may affect the measures taken.
A series of epidemiological measures are widely used to control the spread of epidemics to ensure workplace safety and health in terms of productivity.
Where COVID-19 is not contained, the most effective means of containment is through the use of specialized equipment, followed by management measures and specialized protective clothing.
Anti-infection measures are designed to protect workers from occupational hazards that are independent of employee behavior and can be effective in their implementation.
Management measures are changes to work or work regulations that require implementation by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than the previous two approaches, but can help prevent contamination.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks to the worker, appropriate to the job (e.g. respirators), regularly and properly worn, regularly checked, handled and replaced as necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the US OSHA, low-risk occupations are those that are more stressful to the general public or to coworkers.
Basic precautions should be followed at all workplaces and include frequent hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, respiratory protection guidelines including covering when coughing or sneezing, providing sanitary napkins and disposable pads, providing electronic communication, avoiding alternating entry and exit if necessary, prohibiting the use of peer-to-peer equipment and frequent cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Early identification and isolation of potential infections is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The CDC in the United States recommends that employees with acute respiratory illness symptoms stay home until they have no fever, fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretic or other symptomatic medications and simplify procedures for requesting sick leave, allowing employees to stay home with a sick family member and informing employees of these measures.
According to OSHA, a high-risk occupation is one that requires frequent contact or close proximity to persons with unknown or suspected COVID-19 infection within a distance of less than 1.8 m, but who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through contact with other people in a business setting or through recent travel to a COVID-19-infected area.
These include workers who are in close contact with the general public such as those working in schools, working in crowded areas and catering stores. Control of infection with equipment designed for these workers and other high-risk groups includes ventilation systems, increasing the number of ventilators, and introducing personal protective signs such as plastic to protect you from smoking and providing a new window for workers to use while out of the vehicle. Management measures to prevent workers from using toilets and other means of protecting workers at high risk of infection include encouraging workers who may be sick to stay at home, changing the number of people at work using face masks, avoiding the use of face masks or other protective clothing in workplaces, and providing other necessary information to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including the introduction of a mask and other protective equipment, a mask and other protective equipment, a mask and other protective equipment, a mask and other protective equipment, which are often needed to prevent the spread of the virus, and the introduction of a COVID-19-preventive system.
Workers in this high-risk group are rarely required to use a respirator.
When a person becomes ill on board, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including isolating the patient from others and maintaining a distance of 2 meters, assigning a single flight attendant to provide the patient with a mask, or requiring the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew must wear disposable medical gloves when assisting an airline patient or touching bodily fluids or working in potentially contaminated areas and wear protective clothing when necessary if an airline patient has a fever, whooping cough or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a dedicated container and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected after use.On passenger ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, virus control includes postponing travel if ill and self-quarantine and reporting to the ship's hospital immediately if a person develops fever or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, the person should be monitored by a medical professional when placed in isolation.In schools and day care centers, the CDC recommends temporary confinement for cleaning or disinfection when an infected person is seen in a school building regardless of whether the person is infecting others.
Even if there is a low or high incidence of human transmission, contact avoidance measures may be implemented by suspending school visits and large gatherings such as gymnastics or choral singing classes or dining in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between chairs, keeping space for entry and exit, avoiding unnecessary visits and using a separate clinic for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is local transmission, in addition to social distancing measures and long-term school closures, consideration may be given to the possibility of immediate infection for security personnel who are on a daily basis, according to the CDC.
Security personnel who have come into contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient are required to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical personnel, including wearing protective clothing.
In the event of contact during the arrest, personnel should wipe and disinfect their belts and equipment before reusing them with household detergents or wipes and follow standard instructions for storing and disposing of protective clothing used for storage and laundry.
OSHA recommends that some health and recreation workers are at high or very high risk of infection.
High-risk occupations include medical, laboratory, and transportation workers who have been in or out of the hospital and may have been in contact with a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
They are at higher risk of infection when the practitioner performs activities that include breathing, taking or testing samples of a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
The procedures for oxygenation include intravenous infusion, dialysis, respiratory infusion, some dental procedures and examination or internal sampling.
The greatest risk of infection in the restroom is associated with the organism preparation staff of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; they are at higher risk when performing lethal screening tests.
A special ventilator may be appropriate for some of the nurses and staff on leave.
The measurements should be taken in accordance with the clinical safety guidelines for level 3.
WHO recommends that patients who come to the hospital be isolated in a waiting area for suspected COVID-19 infection.With the addition of protective clothing, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for those working within 2 meters of known or suspected patients, those infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who are performing respiratory procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or higher respirators must be used in accordance with a strict, written respiratory safety protocol that includes testing, training and clinical testing.
Other types of respirators may provide better protection for the wearer and make the worker feel more comfortable.WHO does not recommend that workers wear masks because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a disease transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends that only medical masks be worn by reception staff from various facilities.
For respiratory technicians, caregivers, or those who carry COVID-19 patients without supplemental oxygen, WHO recommends wearing a medical mask, a mask or helmet, a jacket, and gloves.
When a patient is given oxygen, the medical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because of the global inadequacy of PPE, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE with the use of removable medical equipment, introducing barriers such as window openings, and restricting direct access to the room of a COVID-19 patient to the use of PPE only when specifically required, maintaining a single respirator without compromising the time spent caring for multiple patients, coordinating monitoring and processing of PPE and preventing the use of masks for those who do not show symptoms.

COVER: [Covid-19] Reducing the burden and preparing for the future
The following is a list of all known from the series.
CC0: No exclusive rights to the artist
We are in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear indication that the world has become a village and we need to help each other.
We have not faced these challenges, but we know that the best way to deal with the pandemic is to understand the issues around the world, to collaborate and to remain united in this community.
The kindness and care we have received from all our colleagues through email, phone and chat is a testament to the extraordinary personality we have had the good fortune to work with you enough.
I cannot thank you enough or express how proud I am of you all as fellow workers.
Last week, someone expressed his appreciation for our work.
He reminded me that Wikipedia is now widely used around the world, which is a strong indication that it is a useful information site and should remain online and available to everyone.
Your job is what makes it possible, whether it's keeping the site running or our employees happy or our workplace safe.
The world needs Wikipedia information now more than ever.
Now is the time not just to look at what we do, but how we do it, which will make a meaningful difference in the world.
Given the importance of this responsibility and your role in it, we are going to make some important changes to the way we work, starting next week.
Adjusting to our schedule
As Robyn said, our team met last night to discuss our strategy and our schedule for the days and months ahead.
In that article, we discussed what we thought would be the right answer to our current situation and the best way to keep the family going in these times.
In particular, we wanted to remove obstacles and sustain our assignments for a long time.
If you want to call, that's fine.
Of the servants, and of all that were under the covenant:
We expect to work 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not call it a vacation; if you can work regular hours, we can use it to fulfill our responsibilities.
But today, the world is changing and your life is the priority when it comes to caring for loved ones, shopping, or shopping.
We do not track your work hours.
If you are sick, do not go to work.
Not stated, but emphasized.
You do not have to apply for sick leave or paid leave, you should inform your supervisor and he will help your team to revise the schedule and schedule so that the basic work can continue.
(If you are tested positive for COVID-19, contact Bryan at T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide you with the support and management care you need.)
Hourly payments will be paid in full.
We have reviewed and reaffirmed our commitment to our contractual obligations and our hourly payments.
Each will be paid based on the actual hours worked under normal circumstances.
There are times when you are too ill to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to escape the stress of the world.
What we do can be of great value especially in these times.
Again, the goal is to take care of yourself.
Our recommendation is that you speak to your manager, to find out what to expect and to make adjustments accordingly.
Some work is considered important.
There are things we must keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety and fundraising (and others) teams perform critical work that requires additional support.
We will begin to review all departments to review the objectives and adjust our focus to support the core of our mission.
There are important things we all have to do, but there are important projects we need to focus on.
Doing little now will not produce results.
We do not plan to do nearly double to make up for lost time once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work overtime to keep your deadline because it is not possible now.
We recognize that things have changed and we will work to set new goals and timetables where appropriate.
What will happen to the year's agenda?
To accommodate the current situation with the daily working hours, we would like to change the 2020-2021 calendar.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 budget period to allow time for budgeting to allow employees to focus on their primary work, care for themselves and their loved ones while supporting those who are looking to or want to work part-time in the next few weeks.
This extension of time significantly reduces the work scheduled by the shadow throughout the family.
We will present our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and will update the other representatives and the groups on the next guidelines as soon as possible once it is approved.
The planning team made good use of the leadership capabilities demonstrated.
Environment, risk of disease, and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues working at SF had come into contact with someone who may have infected him with COVID-19.
But, out of great care, we hired a team of antiviral hygienists to spray the entire San Francisco office with a disinfectant.
They used hospital-level antiviral technology and deactivated all the access points, access points and bank sensors that reach our workstations.
The building is implementing the protocol for virus prevention with the use of security equipment for the users.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared if we decide to re-do it.
Our DC office at WeWork has shared its COVID-19 response protocol with us and all DC staff.
Until last week, our DC office had switched to fully remote operation in compliance with the guidelines issued by San Francisco.
As some of my colleagues in NYC know, we had begun negotiations to rent a house in Brooklyn.
The discussions are ongoing, but they may take a while.
Some of my colleagues were working remotely for the first time.
Our long-term remote workers know that this can be changed and we would like to advise them:
Cut back on the meeting time to one or two hours if it is late.
If the sessions are no longer needed, consider how to divide the study into longer sessions.
To explain the advice clearly, to have a clear text of the study and to send the documentation ahead of time.
Let video be the focus using apps like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and instant information sharing.
Allow the executive director to chair each meeting, have someone monitor the discussions and follow-up of the speakers and someone to take notes (or co-write the minutes).
Email technical support when you need a high-speed dial-up.
Eat simple meals to maintain good health.
Go to #remoties on Slack to report your work challenges
The Workforce Group reviews the guidelines for online training sessions to recruit and increase the workforce in the Organization.
Last week, we asked all funding agencies to suspend the public fundraising activities of Wikimedia as a training program for new online writers, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we know that requests to stop and other instructions make it difficult to complete their fundraising efforts and that no one will punish them for delay or change of goal.
Next week, we will follow up with more guidelines on Wikimania and other local and regional conferences that are specific to specific areas.
The general perception of global communities is painful to stop but there is comfort, clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and others.
Thus, CRT is creating a page on Meta-Wiki to give the community a place to track the impact and keep track of the information we share.
Keeping up with the latest news on COVID-19
We will send you an invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for the special staff meeting.
We will use this opportunity to update you, answer your questions and spend more time sharing information.
We are all in this pandemic together and we are here to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive updates from this email and other relevant information about COVID-19 at the Wiki Office.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all information will be in one place.
We are also looking for ways to keep in touch with staff living in countries currently affected by the pandemic.
If you have a question about travel, activities, operations or internet issues or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help you coordinate your activities as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, email Bryan Judan, Global Chief Human Resources and Operations Officer.
None of these changes should be viewed as a resignation from our job or responsibilities.
Rather, it is a reminder that today our work and responsibilities are likely to change in ways that have never happened in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to help each other keep working, to do our jobs according to the help they need and to give the world a service that can be used.
The work we have planned will be there waiting for us until that time comes.
At the moment, we are in a period of mutual support and time for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need you all to make it happen and we need you to take care of yourself and your families so that you are well if needed.
Now you should wash your hands and not touch your face!
The following are the members of the Management Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein that forms enzymes that bind to the outer membrane (cell wall) of the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 modulates the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang ((1-7)), making it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.ACE2 also serves as a gateway to the cell for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme-containing protein is often referred to as hACE2.
The enzyme-forming protein Angiotensin-con 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the endothelial surface and on other tissues.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal portion of peptidase M2 and the C-terminal portion of collectrin, which carries renal medicinal acid.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I protein complex, whose active enzyme-containing protein subunit is localized to the surface of lung cells and other cells.
The extracellular portion of ACE2 is cleaved from the membrane by a transcription factor known as sheddase, and the resulting protein enters the gastrointestinal tract and then leaves the intestine.
ACE2 is found in many tissues: ACE2 is expressed in the cell wall, primarily in type II lung cancer cells, small intestine cells, blood vessel cells and blood platelets, and in the lymph nodes of many tissues.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The first task of ACE2 is to set the correct ACE.
ACE is a transcription of angiotensin I into angiotensin II which is a blood-pressure-lowering neurotransmitter.
ACE2 also synthesizes carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine into angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses into angiotensin with large blood vessels (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also activates the neurotransmitter SLC6A19 and plays a role in Hartnup syndrome.
As a transcriptional protein, ACE2 acts as a key entry point for the cell walls that cross certain coronaviruses, namely HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of the SARS-CoV S1 protein and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 subunit of the cell results in a process of endocytosis and the transfer of the virus from its original site to the protein-producing cells that are repaired in the cell membrane.
This entry also prepares the S protein to act by cleaving TMPRSS2, and research is currently looking at how to inhibit it to form a key therapeutic mechanism.This led to the hypothesis that lowering ACE2 levels in the cell could help fight the disease.
However, several professional societies and regulatory agencies have called for continued efforts to restrict ACE to approved doses and treat ARB.
A comprehensive review and review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% lower risk of influenza infection compared to control subjects".
Furthermore, "the risk of measles infection was reduced in high-risk patients treated with ACE inhibitors, particularly in patients with heart disease, congestive heart failure, and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in deaths from measles, although the outcome was not significantly greater than the risk of overall measles infection".
ACE2 (rhACE2) is being considered as the newest treatment for pulmonary hypertension, and appears to improve pulmonary circulation and increase oxygen supply to areas affected by bacterial pneumonia.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and its onset of action is 30 minutes later than the time when the effects of the reaction begin to be seen (when) in 24 hours.
Several studies have identified rhACE2 as a promising treatment for patients with renin-angiotensin-resistant (RAS) systemic intolerance or for patients with high circulation of angiotensin II. The use of rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
bCOVID-19 is a mobile application designed to help identify people who have had contact with the coronavirus 2019-20 pandemic, for example, in the process of identifying people ("numbers") who may have had contact with an infected person.
Many programs have been developed or have been requested by governments in some provinces and territories.
Many frameworks have been developed to build applications that understand how people have met.
Concerns about the breach of personal data have been raised, particularly with regard to location-based systems for app users.
Another highly invasive alternative is using Bluetooth to log in and identify other mobile phones using a neighboring app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would be rolling out the feature to support Bluetoo app-based apps, and it will be immediately rolled out on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 infected individuals.
It is used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app, developed by a large community of IT and communications professionals, was released as an open source and publicly available information.North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-enabled app to detect proximity to severely infected people and provide prompt response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting acceptance in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government said that the contact tracing system was in the final stages of development and should be available for deployment in the coming weeks.Similar systems are being planned in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing mobile apps modeled on Singapore's TraceTogether and Russia's BlueTrace.Russia plans to launch a virtual privacy app for COVID-19 patients in Moscow that will ensure they stay home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security implementation at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of practical problems that mobile app-based systems cause, including the fact that they signal sick and healthy users and that they fail to deliver the intended outcome if the use of such apps is limited to a small number of people.
To address concerns about the spread of these deceptive or malicious coronavirus monitoring apps, Apple has set a limit on the types of organizations that can introduce coronavirus monitoring apps into the App Store, allowing only "publicly approved" or trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Individuals have expressed concerns about mass surveillance using mobile technology, in particular whether the infrastructure set up to control the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the pandemic is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a petition calling for the use of this form of surveillance to be reduced.
The organizations have identified eight governmental criteria for their projects:
The inspection must be legal, necessary and proportionate to its purpose ";
the review period should include an indication of the expiry date;
information should only be used for COVID-19 related purposes;
the security and confidentiality of the information to be protected and demonstrated for protection based on evidence;
the technology must be non-discriminatory or unbiased;
any communication must be based on law;
there should be a mechanism to prevent and prevent violence;
"A practical involvement is required from all the necessary stakeholders, including public health experts and the underserved groups. The German Technological Centre (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also outlined a list of priorities.
A Google/Apple initiative to address the ongoing issue of surveillance is to remove the tracking of infected individuals from their systems when this is no longer necessary.
Some countries have adopted a mobile-based tracking system instead of mobile technology, eliminating the need for mobile-based tracking and the ability to avoid being tracked.
In Israel, the tracking of contacts for a viral infection has been approved.
A person-based tracking system with the ability to access personal information about a person's current location poses serious privacy concerns.
Not all data storage systems are technologically capable but need to be able to access personal data about the location of the individual; many systems are in place that respect the privacy of the individual and use data storage only when there is a need to transfer data.
In South Korea, a non-telephone technology was used to track contacts.
Instead of using the mobile-based technology, data was collected using a variety of methods including mobile phone usage, sim card activity and notification of people with severe infections via text messages on their mobile phones.
In addition to using this data to identify those who have been infected, the government has also made local information available to everyone, due to changes in privacy laws after the MERS outbreak.
Individuals can access this information through a variety of mobile technologies and websites. Countries including Germany have used both national and international methods to provide personal information.
As of April 6, 2020, no explanation has been released.
The method of tracking contacts with highly sensitive personal data is based on data from at least 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups studied the potential for privacy breaches, such as the use of Bluetooth (BLE) technology that allows users to share data with nearby phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a force that combines national and community outreach and does not work in a uniform way.Public outreach includes the Personal Data Protection (DP-PPT) contact tracing system, Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), Holiday Contact Numbers (CEN), Privacy Information Tracking (PACT) and so on.
In this way, the personal data of the individuals identified is not leaked, and the identification of contacts is done digitally.
The privacy team at MIT Media Lab is continuing to search for a reliable data breach alert, a method to keep personal data confidential and use location-based tracking to obtain information on the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on a study by Apps Gone Rogue: Privacy Tracking published in March 2020.An alternative approach reported is Tracking Infection by Enigma MPC, a technology developer for privacy-based privacy management, which was also developed by MIT Media Laboratory.
The reliable tracking of contacts uses digital tools to enable users to share information about the location of infection and health information with the authorities without compromising privacy.
On 5 April 2020, a consortium of groups that have been confronted with the often-confronted issue of compliance established the TCN International Forum, which aims to unify and create a global collaborative approach to mobile networking technology for tracking infections, allowing for a broader approach.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had introduced a tracking system for infections using government technology.
On April 10, 2020, Android and iOS mobile operators Google and Apple announced that they had a system to track infections, a system that the companies claimed complied with privacy standards, which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and other computer-based systems that protect the privacy of people.
They also announced the role of the technology in the program.
Google and Apple announce that the system is intended to be used in three stages:

The COVID-19 vaccine is a concept for the development of a vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine is available, there is a lot of research being done to test the effectiveness of the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that no vaccine was expected for SARS-CoV-2, which causes the virus, for 18 months.
Five vaccines were still in phase I trials in April.
COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019.
It began to spread worldwide in 2020, prompting a massive investment and research effort to develop a vaccine.
Most companies are using existing vaccines to develop a vaccine that can resist SARS-CoV-2.
As of April, CEPI's focus on vaccine development is on speed, availability, recruitment, and global delivery.
In April, CEPI experts announced that 10 different technologies are being researched and developed in early 2020 to develop a vaccine that is effective against COVID-19.
The current approaches that are still in the phase I stage of the research include:
The DNA and RNA cells in the Phase I vaccine study are: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral cells (Phase I study of the vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI experts in April, 115 vaccine trials are in the early stages, including 78 confirmed clinical trials (79 according to Milken Institute), and 37 announced, but the details are not yet known (presumably planned or in development).
The Phase I-II trial measures quality and efficacy, is generic, closely monitored, and conducted at multiple sites, while avoiding misconceptions, and determining the appropriate dosage.
Phase III trials involve a large, controlled group, and evaluation of the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease, while evaluating whether other effects of the vaccine can be reduced to a tolerable level.
Of the 79 vaccines currently in development (approved in early April 2020), 74 have not yet started human trials (still in the early stages of development).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating a vaccine that could modify the structure of viral cells to help the body build immunity.

On 5 March 2020, Medicago, a Quebec City, Quebec-based healthcare company, announced the development of a vaccine against coronavirus funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine is still undergoing laboratory testing, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had allocated large sums of money specifically for the Covid-19 vaccine, a move that was overruled by the German government.
On 5 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop an mRNA-based vaccine.

Other CEPI partners that have invested in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
In March 2020, Russian health officials announced that experts had begun testing the vaccine on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a COVID-19 vaccine based on blood cells.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of the submission of the Chinese submission.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced C$275 million to fund 96 COVID-19 response projects, including a vaccine project at various Canadian institutions and universities, including those being developed by Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million allocation for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with the goal of creating a "vaccine repository" that would hold more vaccines available in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced that they were conducting a mouse trial of the PittCoVacc vaccine, a potential COVID-19 vaccine, and announced that SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodies from MNA-derived cells had demonstrated the ability to produce antibodies [in mice], which was evident as early as 2 weeks after administration".
On 16 April 2020, the School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a nasal DNA-based vaccine.
Using an anti-virus, DNA will be engineered to be inserted into the insect to produce a non-pathogenic virus-like molecule, which will activate the immune system and produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities collected data to acquire IBM's smartphones, as well as other hardware and software products from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a variety of effects, often referred to as unknown effects.
This means that they can have a positive effect on the immune system.
Another Australian trial is recruiting 4,170 physicians to help.
The vaccines being developed may be of poor quality or ineffective.
Recent studies evaluating the efficacy of vaccines using selected COVID-19 strains, such as ACE2 mice and monkeys, suggest the need for Level 3 quality management measures to combat the existing virus, and international cooperation to enforce quality guidelines.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animals.
As of 2020, no vaccine or vaccine for SARS and MERS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
As reported by the 2005 and 2006 studies, the discovery and development of SARS vaccines and drugs was a priority for government and health agencies worldwide.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was hoped that the ongoing research could provide a viable approach to developing vaccines and drugs to prevent MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed Phase I human trials, and three others were in development, all of which were viral, two from the Adenoviridae virus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one from the MVA virus (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media spread rumors that COVID-19 was common and that a vaccine was already available.
The focus of social media is on the existence of antibodies and vaccines for other coronavirus infections such as the SARS-like coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the respiratory tract virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms of the disease include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and smell, and abdominal pain.
The incubation period of an infected person is five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most people infected with the virus have mild symptoms, some experience respiratory problems and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people had been infected in 210 countries and territories, resulting in an estimated 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 have recovered.The virus is transmitted through contact, usually through the secretions of coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
When these fluids are released during respiration, they usually fall onto the ground or onto an object rather than infecting a person at a distance.
People can also contract the disease by touching the virus and touching the face, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive outside for up to 72 hours.
It is most prevalent in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can also occur before symptoms appear and before infection has spread.The most reliable method of diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) performed using nasal samples.
It is important for a person who is suspected of being infected and for their caregivers to wear masks.
The requirements for the wearing of masks for all people vary, with some authorities advising against it and others requiring people to wear it.
Currently, there is no known vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Inter-communal infections have been reported in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Severe symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or heaviness, facial tingling, difficulty walking, redness of the face or lips; and urgent medical attention when these symptoms occur.
It is not uncommon to experience symptoms including respiratory problems such as sneezing, sneezing or sore throat.
Symptoms of vaginal discharge such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are commonly seen on the upper jaw.
Patients in China first reported symptoms of chest tightness and rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can become so severe that the person becomes short of breath, many organs fail to function, and even die.
This is called the manifestation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people develop symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure.Reports suggest that not all people who have been infected show symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic infections is not yet known; however, the basic information is that they may infect others.
The number of people who do not have symptoms is not yet known but is being studied, based on data from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that says 20% of all infected patients are discharged as asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began including these cases in its daily statistics on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sneezing and sneezing can carry large amounts of the virus.
Speaking loudly produces more fluid than speaking slowly.
A Singaporean study found that coughing without a mask can cause fluid to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is transmitted through the air, the National Science Center says it is possible and that the air from the isolation rooms collected has been tested positive for the virus.
Medical procedures such as catheterization and CPR can cause respiratory secretions that can lead to infection.
While there is some question as to whether the mother can infect the fetus, there is little evidence. The virus can be transmitted when people show symptoms; while there is little chance of transmission before symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that although the ease of transmission of the virus is not yet known, it can infect two to three people.
In particular, the virus has survived for one day on board, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and solid metal ((AISI 304), and four hours on 99% malleable metal.
This can however change with cold and even heat.
Soap and insecticides, when used correctly, can kill the virus; soap damages the anti-virus protein, inhibiting its activity and even removing it from the body or tissue where the virus is present.
Other uses include benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, but the insecticide is less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken for two days after admission to hospital.
Five of the six patients had high levels of the virus in the first test, and the sixth had high levels of the virus in the second day's tests.
The severe coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 is a novel respiratory infection virus, first identified in Wuhan in three people with respiratory problems related to respiratory illness.
All of the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are found in the coronavirus strain.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, killing the anti-virus protein. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, as the virus is transmitted through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in large numbers in the lungs.
The virus uses its spike (horned protein) backbone to bind to ACE2 and enter the organism.
12% of those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, have developed serious heart problems and this is common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular disease is high, due to inflammation and immune system damage that occurs with the progression of the disease, but cardiovascular disease may be associated with an infection of the ACE2 receptors.
ACE2 virus is highly transmissible to the heart and is involved in cardiovascular activity.
Patients in ICU with COVID-19 have experienced problems with circulatory dysfunction (31%) and blood vessel damage (25%), which are associated with a lower chance of recovery.Tests of people who died from COVID-19 have shown respiratory distress disorder (DAD), as well as lung tumors.
Although SARS-COV-2 is ACE2-positive in the body and is localized in respiratory tract cells, COVID-19 patients have also shown symptoms of severe inflammation.
In particular, T cells produced by GM-CSF have been shown to interact with IL-6-inflammatory cells in COVID-19 patients.
Testing revealed immune cells in the body of the victim who died from the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced several diagnostic methods for the epidemic.
The most reliable method of detection is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) .
Samples are taken from the respiratory tract using nasal mucus; however, mucus and sedimentation may also be used.
Results are available in a timeframe of a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be performed, but require two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus cells and then release the lab results to the world to freely produce PCR cells that could be used to test for viral infection.
As of 4 April 2020, immunoassay tests were being developed (which may indicate a current infection or previous exposure) but were not yet available for widespread use.
Chinese testing experience has shown a 60% to 70% efficacy.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the testing facility on 21 March 2020 and it is expected to be operational by the end of the month.The testing guidelines issued by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital outline a method for testing infection based on clinical evidence and the impact of the pandemic.
In the early stages of infection, the virus cells often hide, collect, separate from the host and spread.
As the virus progresses, it penetrates the respiratory tract, forming a pathway (clogging the respiratory tract by blocking the airways) and binding together.
There is limited information on microscopic imaging and the nature of COVID-19.
The results of the viral analysis of the cadaver were:
Eye signs: swelling of the respiratory tract, swelling of the surrounding areas of the heart, obstruction of the airways
Three major types of genetic disorders caused by the virus have been identified:
Mild respiratory failure: fluid-laden tumors in the lungs, increased respiratory tract tumors, unusual respiratory tumors, ruptured tumors and the formation of multiple tumors
acute: diffuse damage to the airways (DAD) and diffuse leaks.
DAD is a major cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and blood vessel obstruction.
Respiratory illness begins more easily: accumulation of airborne particles in the respiratory tract and lungs
Blood: internal bleeding (DIC); formation of new blood cells
Measures to reduce the spread of infection include staying home, avoiding public places, frequent hand washing with soap and water and at least 20 seconds, respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends that people cover their mouths with a clean cloth when coughing or sneezing or cover their mouths with a subcutaneous area in front of the elbow when a cloth is not available.
It is important to wash your hands after coughing or sneezing.
CDC recommends that people wear masks when outdoors, to prevent the spread of infection by people who do not show symptoms.Distancing measures aim to reduce the movement of healthy and infected people by closing schools, workplaces, restricting travel and preventing people from gathering in public places.
The guidelines state that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no known cure for COVID-19.With a vaccine expected to be available in 2021, the best way to combat the pandemic is to implement a curve that reduces new COVID-19 infections, known as "flattening the curve" in English.
CDC recommends frequent hand washing with soap and water and at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are apparently contaminated, before eating, after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a synthetic pesticide with an alcohol content of 60%, which is used when water or soap is not available.In areas where access to the pesticide is difficult, the WHO has identified two additional types of pesticide for use.
This class of drugs includes the pesticides known as ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is a pesticide; it is not a "hand sanitizer".
Glycerol is also added to the supplement.
People are treated with a variety of methods, including fluid therapy, oxygenation, and strengthening of other organs affected by infection.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advises people who suspect infection to wear a mask.
Excess oxygenation (ECMO) has been and continues to be used to address the problem of oxygen deprivation.
People are being awakened to hygiene, health and nutrition to boost their immune system.
Alternative treatment options may be used for people with mild symptoms of infection.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have announced the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The US Emergency Medical and Respiratory Care Centers (EMCs) collected and published clinical data from various IBCCs.
As of April 2020, there is no known cure for COVID-19.
To manage symptoms, medical experts recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen in the early stages of the disease.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the spread of infection, especially in clinical settings where respiratory procedures such as inhaler tubing or manual ventilation are performed.
CDC recommends that physicians who care for COVID-19 patients be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) where they adhere to the guidelines for avoiding close contact and wearing masks. CDC recommends a list of guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the prevention of infection.
These include: PPE shirt, respirator or mask, handbags, and even masks. It is advisable to use respirators, if available, instead of wearing masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved masks for use as personal protective equipment (EUA).
It is designed to protect the wearer from airborne contaminants such as dust but its effectiveness in preventing viral infection is not well established.
Where masks are not available, the CDC recommends that people use face masks, or, in rare cases, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 patients will not be sufficiently affected by it to be given ventilation or other respiratory therapy, but some may need it.
Clinical studies are underway on the types of respiratory systems that can be used to provide respiratory support to COVID-19 patients, with the possibility of using a respirator without the use of a tube or other inhaler.
It is not known whether both methods produce the same results in the first instance.
Some doctors prefer to continue using ventilators when available because this method reduces the risk of air leakage compared to the use of a ventilator.This infection is more common in older people (over 60 years old and especially over 80 years old).
Many developed countries have a problem of bed shortages, which raises the question of coping with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases that are serious and need to be hospitalized.
One study in China found that 5% were admitted to the emergency room, 2.3% needed oxygen and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of COVID-19 patients in hospitals receive ICU care.
The use of ventilators continues to be a challenge due to the increasingly severe respiratory problems caused by COVID-19.
There is a need for more PEEP devices to help ventilate patients to reduce injuries and respiratory blockages.
The mechanism of these PEEP devices is not available for older devices.
Research into a vaccine that can treat the disease began in January 2020, and several clinical trials have begun.
Remdesivir is the promising drug.
While it may be until 2021 that new drugs will be available, several drugs are being tested that are either standard treatments for other diseases or have been in research.
Antiviral drugs may be tested on patients.
WHO has invited volunteers to participate in studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug.The FDA has offered a temporary extension of the use of performance enhancing drugs to patients in cases where there is a significant risk to their health.
No FDA studies have been conducted to confirm the efficacy or safety of this treatment.
In February 2020, China launched mobile phone technology to combat the spread of the pandemic.
Users of this method are required to enter their name and personal identification number.
The technology is capable of detecting contamination of the user's area using surveillance data, so that the user can be infected.
Any user of the app can also see the posture of three other users.
Singapore not only advises on self-quarantine, but also notifies local health authorities when a case is detected.South Korea, Taiwan and other countries use mobile phone tracking technology, facial recognition, mobile phone tracking and simulation, to track contacts.
In March 2020, the Israeli government granted technology companies the ability to monitor the mobile phones of suspected infections.
This decision was taken to implement the quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with the infected.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also provided a mobile data monitoring system with the support of the German government's Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect violations of quarantine regulations.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulo Gallera was told by telecommunications operators that "about 40% of people are still walking as they saw fit".
The German government held a 48-hour meeting with more than 42,000 computer scientists.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called on the world to find ways to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience severe depression due to quarantine, travel restrictions, medication effects, or fear of the epidemic itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said that "isolation, loneliness, health stress, over-thinking and poverty have a profound effect on people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may have few or no symptoms, which is similar to other respiratory illnesses or flu.
Mild cases can be cured in two weeks, while severe cases can take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women are at increased risk of COVID-19 based on data from other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data on COVID-19 in pregnant women is not known. COVID-19 may cause respiratory infections in some people.
Some people who have been exposed to COVID-19 may develop severe respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) which can lead to shortness of breath, cognitive impairment and weakness in various organs.
The complications of COVID-19 include systemic blood clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and spleen.
Blood clotting, especially in the dark, was observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while kidney problems were observed in 4%.
Between 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have been shown to have elevated levels of transaminases.
The report also indicates that the time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five of those hospitalized.
However, patients admitted to the ICU spent up to seven days in the hospital before dying.
In a recent study of infected individuals, the time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with an average of 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China found a mortality rate of 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
Tests performed on people who died from pulmonary disease showed a pulmonary cell damage characterized by plaque.
Respiratory problems have indicated that the virus is mutating.
The image of the lungs appeared to be of a person with severe respiratory problems.
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, there was a vascular arrest or cardiac arrest.
March data from the United States indicate that 89% of hospitalizations were for other reasons.Health and socioeconomic factors may also contribute to mortality.
The mortality rates vary from region to region, but also due to the complexity of the methodology.
Neglecting the numbers of those with mild symptoms may increase the death toll from the pandemic.
However, the fact that many deaths are associated with other conditions may discount the mortality rate.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and 2.4 times more likely to become ill or die than nonsmokers.
Hong Kong hospital authorities found water clots at a rate of between 20% and 30% in the lungs of recovered patients, and imaging by medical instruments showed lung damage.
This also means that they should continue to receive care after discharge from the intensive care unit.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether infection caused people who recovered from the outbreak to develop a higher long-term immunity.
It appears to be similar, based on the nature of other coronaviruses, but there have been cases of COVID-19 re-infection after reported recovery from the coronavirus.
These individuals are more likely to be satisfied with the residual protein in their bodies than if they were infected a second time.
The disease is suspected to be uninfected and of animal origin, and the organisms may be able to transmit it.
Its exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the disease was transmitted from person to person.
A study of 41 COVID-19 patients, published in January 2020 in the Lancet, revealed symptoms that began to appear on 1 December 2019.
The WHO officially announced the onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures were taken to count the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region, time and number of tests, health system capacity, treatment options, when the outbreak began and demographic, including age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 virus code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 and code U07.2 to patients who tested positive for COVID-19 but were not laboratory-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the CFR, which is the ratio of infected to dead, and the IFR, which is the ratio of infected (tested to untested) to dead.
These statistics are not chronological and are based on the specific population affected and the treatment provided.
If not all infected individuals start to produce antibodies immediately, the presence of these antibodies can provide information about the number of infected individuals.
At the epicenter of the outbreak, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Gangelt, the epidemic was spread by carnival festivals, spread by young people, resulting in fewer crowds, but not all COVID-19 deaths were reported as such.
Moreover, the German health authorities have not given up.
In the Netherlands, up to 3% of people may have an immune system, as seen in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were reported to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate differ for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is high; as shown by studies in China and Italy.
Men in their 50s are at higher risk, with a difference between men and women in their 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reasons for the sex differences are unknown, but may be due to their physical appearance and behaviour.
Immune differentiation between males and females, a lower incidence of female smoking and a higher incidence of male diseases including heart attacks at a younger age than females may contribute to higher mortality rates in males.
In Europe, 57% of cases were male and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government had not begun collecting gender-based data on COVID-19 infections.
Research on viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affects men and women differently.
A large number of doctors, especially pharmacists, are women, and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially designated the pandemic as COVID-19".
WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI virus, D disease, and 19 stands for when the outbreak first emerged: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid naming a specific region (e.g. China), species or group of people, in accordance with international naming guidelines to combat stereotyping or mislabeling.The virus that causes COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus causing COVID-19" in official communications.
Both the disease and the virus are called "coronavirus".
In Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO announced 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as provisional names for viruses and diseases in compliance with the 2015 ban on the use of place names in virus and disease names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited capacity to satisfy the market, some manufacturers are developing healthcare products such as nasal samples, respirators and respirators.
For example, when a hospital in Italy needed air conditioners urgently and the supplier failed to meet the deadline, a local factory quickly produced 100 of the needed air conditioners overnight.
After the first case of COVID-19, rumors, misinformation, misinformation about the origin, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans can transmit the virus to other animals.
Studies have failed to show transmission of the virus in pigs, poultry and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
There is an international study of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs being conducted by government agencies, academic teams and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of four existing generic drugs suspected of being effective in curing the pandemic.
There is no vaccine, but various agencies are testing different vaccines.
Preliminary studies are being conducted on SARS-CoV SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being studied.
First, researchers want to develop a complete vaccine against the virus.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to stimulate the immune system to detect new COVID-19 infections.
The second step is the use of microorganisms, which is a technique designed to create a vaccine that allows the immune system to detect the presence of microorganisms.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on a horn-like protein that allows the virus to absorb ACE2 compounds.
The third method is the DNA-based (RNA, a new form of vaccine).
These types of vaccines are currently being studied for quality and efficacy testing.On March 16, 2020, four volunteers in Seattle began testing the vaccine.
A vaccine containing genes derived from a virus that can cause disease.Increasing immune response has been suggested as a viable option for the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but there is still a problem.
As of April 2020, more than 300 vaccines are in clinical trials.
Seven trials were conducted on the most commonly approved drugs for the treatment of malaria, including four for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Research in China is focusing on conventional antiviral drugs, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir underway in several countries, with a report expected by the end of April.
As of April 2020, there is a regular review of clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines.Several common antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir mixed with interferon beta.
As of April 2020, there is increasing evidence of remdesivir's efficacy.
Patients treated with remdesivir showed improvement.
Phase III trials are underway in the United States, Canada, and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020, with preliminary results available.
Yet, there is a call for more research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Viral Diseases, while recommending a daily intake of one gram, warns that doubling this intake could lead to serious complications and death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA provisionally approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by physicians treating COVID-19 patients.Class 7 guidelines include the use of interferon, ribavirin or umfenovir to treat COVID-19.
The primary data suggest that large doses of ribavirin are needed to control non-transmitted SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide can also be used for virus that has entered the body later in the study following the detection of low levels of SARS-CoV-2.The study found that a type 2 receptor-mediated protein precursor (TMPRSS2) is required for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have shown significant inhibitory effects on the use of these drugs without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not drive out SARS-CoV-2 without intravenous action and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokines can cause problems when COVID-19 becomes more severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may interact with cytokines.The National Health Commission of China has approved Tocilizumab as a potential treatment after a limited number of studies.
A Phase 2 trial is underway in Italy with a national trial following positive results in patients with severe disease.
A blood test of the pigs for cytokines, to see how they develop, is suspected to be the cause of some deaths.
In 2017, the FDA approved the use of an anti-inflammatory anti-interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on a study of the treatment of steroid-induced thrombocytopenia, called CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no evidence that tocilizumab is effective in treating CRS.
Research is underway to provide clean, multi-drug antibodies from people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a non-vaccination alternative to antibodies from another person.
This method was tested on SARS but was not successful.
The virus neutralization mechanism is a previously thought-out mechanism where antibodies derived from another person can combine to fight SARS-CoV-2.
Other methods, such as increasing or increasing the body's immune system, may be used.
Alternative therapies are being developed using human-derived antibodies, such as laboratory-generated antibodies.
There should be increased access to blood donation, the collection of blood from healthy individuals and the use of antibodies to the virus, to ensure that it is readily available to the body.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of diseases with only nine symptoms.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, became infected and died of COVID-19 after reporting the outbreak of the virus.
