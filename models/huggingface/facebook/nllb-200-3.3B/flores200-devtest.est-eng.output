The researchers described the animal's fur as brownish-chestnut with a light or yellowish-red underside.
The findings provide a glimpse into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a developed feather pit, called the feather pit, but have other feathery parts  suleebe and feather-pit hazy base , the researchers concluded that it is likely that the feathery parts evolved later than the rest.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or demonstration.
Scientists assumed that although this was a young dinosaur's tail, the sample showed the adult's larynx, not the chick's pubic hair.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

In France, elections have traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed paper with the name of the candidate in the envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter will throw the envelope into the voting box and sign the voters' list.
The procedural rules of the French electoral law are rather strictly formulated in the law.
From 1988 onwards, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of voting and no envelopes are added to the box other than those which have been properly counted and added by voters entitled to vote.
Candidates may send representatives to monitor each part of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, who follow specific instructions.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the rescue services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for the murder of his son.
He's being held until he's charged and arraigned, but any testimony from any of the witnesses could be of questionable value, because his picture has been published in many places.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but in Scotland the legal system is different and the courts consider the publication of the photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee commented that journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line when publishing photos of suspects and so on.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the prosecution, has told reporters that they will not comment until at least the indictment is filed.
According to the leaked document, the border crossing is what Palestine wants to be based on the border that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of the agreement, the military presence in the valley be guaranteed for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep the army only for five years.
The shooters participating in the supplementary controlled test were closely monitored by the forestry officers, as the test was under surveillance and its effectiveness was being assessed.
The NPWS and NSW affiliate recruited qualified volunteers through the NSW Hunting Program.
According to NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Director, Mick O'Flynn, the bailiff, the first four shooters selected for the launch operation received extensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous acting President as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was created in Martelly in response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The violent protests in Kohati were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been expected since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPods being damaged by overheating, which in total has caused six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
According to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), there were 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
"In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report 'very regrettable'".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09.19 GMT Friday evening).
The Northern Marianas Crisis Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held tourists from Hong Kong hostage, hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an old woman who needed to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the Auckland State Hospital for Women in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that when a certain hormone is given to the fetus, it speeds up the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators recovered two aircraft black boxes from the flight recorder on Wednesday.
Even his fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen, my first manager, and she left us in the night two months ago, a very special woman, just like her, a strong woman".
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented that ""Luna was as strange as I was... maybe even stranger... I love her and miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".""
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australian republicanism rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those polled agree, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to remain the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the results, 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic at the earliest possible opportunity, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, his fitness is in doubt.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to get through the pain because it's forbidden at the Olympics.
On January 25, mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number known to man.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that the comets supplied Earth with water, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and signed the same-sex marriage bill last month.
He called the rumors political nonsense and folly.
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead of the older technology based on ground-based radars, it uses satellite-based technology that allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint the position of aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
'There is no public transport and no overground trains stop at Wembley, and there are no underground car parks and 'park and ride' facilities.'
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science revealed the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes, rolled into tiny designs.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted or knitted into a palm tree.
It can be made very thin and put on other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make yourself an indicator of the red heads with the juice.
Capsicum salt changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is the number of hydrogen ions present in the test chemical (H is the pH of the hydrogen).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together and then squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers, which creates a funny feeling and forms a shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a toilet, connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in Crete, in houses of the cities of the Minoan culture, and in Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were mixed.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision a little.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most significant change that the bicycle has brought to us is a much easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to it, we have a train, a car, and many other transportation devices.
The lower levels are medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, starting with rabbits and ending with antelopes and goats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat significantly more small prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job each cat does that keeps him from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups, or parrots.
Flocks consist of one to three mated adult males and up to 30 females and pups.
The females are usually very closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Many wolf and dog packs behave like lions, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar, and only these four animals can roar.
The tiger's roar is not the loud roar of a lion but rather a phrase of words shouted in a roaring voice.
Otzelots like to eat small animals, and when they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, but all the animals they hunt are much smaller than the otzelot.
Scientists believe that the stingrays track and locate prey by scent, sniffing the places where they have been.
They have excellent vision in the dark and move very slowly, blending into the surrounding environment to hunt their prey and then attacking the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (e.g. they move across a mountain range or river or migrate to a new island, and it is not easy to return), they often end up in a different environment from the previous one.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics from the ones it used to have and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The algae population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
The result, after thousands or even millions of years, is that the two populations look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process the species gap, which is just the emergence of a new species, and the species gap is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mossaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mossaurus.
Its long jaws contained over 70 teeth, with extra teeth in the jaw, meaning that nothing that crossed its paths escaped.
It is not known for certain, but the mosasaurus may have had a double-tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a man-eater.
He also attacked anyone who went into the water, even a giant dinosaur, as if the T-Rex wasn't some kind of opponent for him.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual reptiles, including the wild boar, the peacock, the tick, and a rodent called the blackbird.
Another difference was that while poor men and women sat in chairs, rich men enjoyed banquets where they ate in a state of exuberance.
Ancient Roman food could not contain the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples to each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests cared for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that can be entered only by the priests.
Sometimes the temples were joined by special pyramid-shaped towers called shikurats.
The tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of its life outdoors.
Women cooked outside; the shops were just open shelves facing the street.
The absence of large forests in Canaan made timber very expensive.
According to ancient Scandinavian legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map drawn on it.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"The words 'The original of the Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776' were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and the text is found on the bottom of the document, inverted".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early years a large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 by 24 1⁄2 inches) was turned into a roll for storage.
So it's likely that the note was just added as a label.
D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, an operation that became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and liberated French forces had liberated the south of France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "citizen", which is related to the Latin words civis, "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also defines, to some extent, the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of states.Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge over generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a sufficient cultural heritage.
The larger cultures often lose relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies, under the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, of which Congress was the only part.
Congress had no power to impose the tax, and, lacking national executive or judicial authority, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enact all legislation.
Nor did he have the power to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the most successful team in the world, alongside the German national football team, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, netball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Talisport is most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in this field at international and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the Japanese island group, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan was mentioned as early as the 15th century, when European sailors sailing past recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "the beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, initiating a reorganization of indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures : Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used format for photographic film in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its proportions are inherited from the digital camera's image sensor dimensions.
The 35mm format is actually a bit of a confounding 36mm wide by 24mm long.
The graph of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore assumed to be 3 × 2.
Many common formations (such as the APS group of formations) are equal to or close to this ratio.
The oft-used and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of regularity in the image.
According to this, the most efficient location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under tight control.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the nations of Europe, despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from kings to common citizens.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are meant for that purpose.
For over a thousand years, the ecclesiastical power center had been Rome, and this concentration of power and money raised many questions about whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the war began, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian resources, although the blockade was in breach of generally accepted international law, as enshrined in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the open ocean, threatening even neutral bases.
With no particular reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a large proportion of the citizens and peoples were pacifist and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job in New York City with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with a 4 cent bill, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of Chinese history or each family in power had a separate dynasty.
There were also periods of unstable provinces divided between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce fighting took place between many of the nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died in inter-war battles, hoping to gain the highest office in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to the ruler.
Even after the Revolution, the fields of activity were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they were now based on military merit.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things deeper than worldly life, and he often went to meditate in a cave on Mount Noori ('the light') that became known as Hira.
The cave that has survived the test of time gives us a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual rocks.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, situated on the top of a mountain north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find if you're told it exists, because once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but a clear sky and the many surrounding mountains, and the cave is hidden, and there is little to see of this world.
The pyramids of Cheops are the only one of the seven wonders of the world to have survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many giant pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol 'upright' is similar to the letter 'V' and the symbol 'below' is similar to a clasp or a square whose bottom is missing.
"Upper" means you should start at the top and push the hook, and "below" means you should start at the base of the hook (where your hand is holding the hook) and pull the hook.
The upper strophe produces a softer sound, while the lower strophe is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to write your own notation, but remember that the printed strokes are there for a musical reason and should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles by a mob of Parisian thugs.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob, who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of the arcade open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the queen.
The declarations of war by US imperialism against the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover the costs of Wall Street banking and bond interest on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits earned from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the elementary profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, you must understand the context that inspired the Order to create them.
The period in which these events occurred is called the High Middle Ages, and it was a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The high plateau was preceded by the early stage and followed by the late stage, which is eventually reckoned by convention as the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide variety of ideas in practice, ranging from technological drive or technological imperative to the firm belief that human destiny is governed by the logic of the laws of science and its expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically influenced, and that technology itself has an impact on society that is internal rather than socially caused.
For example, it can be said that the existence of motor vehicles is certainly a factor in the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so efforts are being made to develop new production methods to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to more road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing damaged bodies in health care.
An important part of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was shaped by individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerged, and these, being in harmony with the location of a society, were superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a place of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But because of the slow communication channels, styles may have been lagging behind in the West for as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most notable developments of this period, due to the Crusades, was the use of knots to secure clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming in which food is produced in quantities sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Natural farming is a simple, often nature-based system, using seeds from the ecological region, rotation of crops, or other relatively simple methods such as .
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures connect individuals with similar ideas who feel that societal norms do not apply to them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through the use of a particular and symbolic style, including fashion, mannerisms and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases where adults failed to socialize children while they were growing up because of neglect, misfortune or intentional mistreatment.
Such children are called feral or feral children, and humans (often their parents) have kept feral children; in some cases, parents abandoned the child because of serious intellectual or physical deficiencies.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals, some of whom were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a child is fully raised by an animal, the wild child behaves (within the physical limits) exactly as the animal that raised it, for example, it is afraid of humans or indifferent to them.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the educational scale approach takes it a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a learning method but rather a way of supporting people who are about to acquire a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be virtual or real, or in other words, it can be a teacher or a little Microsoft Office pencil pusher.
The software integrates virtual steps to challenge, refer to and explain procedures that may be too complex for the learner to handle alone.
Children are taken to orphanages for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but it does happen.
We find that the foster system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The beneficiary should provide all the necessities that were missing from the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are cited as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified personal involvement and ongoing relationships as new motivating aspects when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting facial movements, or micro-expressions, lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that correctly interpreting the micro-signs makes it possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately recognize sincerity.
He even suggested that animals, such as domesticated dogs, have such a capacity to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes that variation from the population.
In the case of separation and recombination, the diversity shifts back and forth between the two funds in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has difficulty meeting its amino acid needs with the help of available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.
The easiest plant sources would have been the proteins in leafy vegetables, but for primates like us, they're only easy to digest when cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (seals, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a high protein content containing all the necessary amino acids.
With all this in mind, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
It's easy if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to press it.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or a well-known diuretic tea) before bedtime to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace in a person is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive the life force is, and everyone can find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that's gonna stop you from achieving enlightenment is the tension and the negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded in the Mahajana with the Way of Love and various Indian yoga techniques.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it involves kundalini yoga, meditation and the journey of all-encompassing love.
Through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations, the Kundalini energy (the illumination energy) is awakened in the Kundalini yoga.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods, and through the visualization of the various gods, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S.A. At the end of the war, the countries went to war over system, process and cultural clashes.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the authorized armies were to fight in real battles on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgeheads.
However, the plans fell apart almost overnight, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the front of Belarus and Ukraine after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods is arguably the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure that the state can move people and goods, while preventing the enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most recent and notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which was mainly a submarine force, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were originally domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to get easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept as herders, often on heather or other pastures, and often tended by young or adolescent goats, more akin to the more familiar sheep herds, a method still used today.
Wagon tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage tracks consisted of nothing but parallel timber planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull greater loads than were possible on the more rugged roads of the day.
The use of ropes was an early means of holding the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails were more effective if they had iron rails on them.
This became the standard method, but the iron consumed more than the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were put into use.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Homo erectus (or upright man) began walking upright two million years ago.
Their ancestor, the australopithecus, was not accustomed to walking upright.
Examples of bipedal specialization are found in the fossil Australopithecus dating to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the sahelanthrops may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce some of the suffering in the future, we can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement and even become activists.
Often, it's just like treating the symptoms, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and make it go away.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased because of overpopulation and a sluggish way of life.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, the manuscript of the bill, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the John Dunlap printing house a few blocks away.
In one night, 150 to 200 copies were made, known today as the Dunlap copies.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The copy made by the 25th Dunlap is the earliest extant copy of the Declaration, the original handwritten copy of which has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have claws and they can fly.
But there are many other features of birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and claws on their legs, and they lay eggs and walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or  when used in computer length as  bits.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general and do not allow for an immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested or ingested poison may be an open package of medication or toxic household chemicals that are in the vicinity.
See the label for instructions on the first-aid of a specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term beetles officially for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the familiarity of the ammosphere with bacteria, which are extremely well adapted to live as parasites on humans.
Both predatory and bed-flies are brood-parasites, adapted to life in the nest or in the host's habitat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples may choose to give up their child for adoption.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can be the child's parents.
The fundamental purpose of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and in fact, it is the basis for most scientific research.
Research is not only guided by experimentation - an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses - but also by asking questions and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific views, including his psychological ones, were accepted.
As Greek proficiency declined, the Western world found itself cut off from Greece's philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms that govern physiology and behavior are often due to endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
The occurrence of periodic rhythms, which are not simply a reaction to external periodic factors, has been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining circadian system that continues its free-flowing cycle even in the absence of external influences.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that suggested that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, marking the DNA in the phage with either radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the views and the wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting the Boreno orangutans, taking pictures of them, and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and they are passed by others who have jobs in the town they just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private vehicle-based transport system.
Science has now shown that this vast carbon-producing economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has been favorable to human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed lands, complaints about the quality of water or collapsing bridges are rarely heard at similar levels.
Why do transportation systems complain about everyday failures? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
A traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because the behaviour of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be represented mathematically in a broad sense.
To better describe the traffic flow, links have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links contribute to the planning, design and operation of the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to use airborne transport, and their ability to fly made it much easier for them to avoid and find food, and they were much more efficient at making friends.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against their body.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that are unable to turn their wings back are the kiwi and the day-fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought otherwise. The solar system, with the sun (and even other stars) moving around the earth.
That makes sense, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, and it has eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at times six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing could surpass the size of the Giza pyramids or the technical knowledge of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new nation admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the smallest country in the world in terms of population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislative and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the country's working people, while Latin is used for religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to mine with basic tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four aggregate atoms (in the same order)  solid, liquid, gas and plasma , although he also speculated that they form the new substances that we see.
So alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, and don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that they would fit into the trillion-dot number at the end of this sentence.
So when it was first introduced, the pen was a good friend to many.
Pencil has lost its importance and use, unfortunately because of the development of newer writing methods.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to use a scanner.
One can only speculate what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The nuclear bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together the nucleus of a cell with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy chariot up a mountain, but when you split the core again, you release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down on a small scale or spontaneously.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick in the front and 100 kilometers thick in the back.
It's thinner under the warm seas and thicker under the mountainous terrain.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is thinner, so it was easier to surface on the lava.
Theories of needs-for-achievement try to understand what makes people act and what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted during adulthood.
These theories are about what makes certain people want the things they do, and what environmental factors make those people do or not do certain things.
The two most popular needs-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start managing their former peers, this can generally lead to two types of behaviour: one end of the spectrum is trying to remain 'a single boy' (or girl).
It is difficult for this type of manager to make unpopular decisions, to call for order, to make assessments, to assign duties and to give employees responsibility.
On the other end of the spectrum is a person who becomes unrecognizable, feeling that he has to change everything the team has done so far, and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
Such behavior often causes friction between the conductors and the rest of the crew.
Virtual teams are subject to the same high standards as regular teams, but there are still some minor differences.
The virtual team members are often the direct contact point for their real-life team.
They usually have more autonomy than regular crew members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is an administrative team to which each member reports.
What is the reason for a company to undertake the action of creating a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functional departments of the organisation, creativity and inventiveness will emerge.
As a result, the company's collaboration to overcome the barrier can lead to a new inventive process that meets the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and also shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and so it limits the scope of the study and makes it more specific.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supporting the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
And that gave us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand better the processes that go on in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with knowledge, forms of AI are a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves automating machines in such a way that they can solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, diagnosing and answering customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and is also built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every classroom, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places that can't be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions, where students can sit in class and view museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire fine art.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on one trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at North Carolina's Bennett School design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept as memories.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills, and while students often start their blogging experience with a lack of grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Also, 'blogging forces students to know the world around them better.' 'Capturing the attention of readers encourages students to be cunning and curious (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of appropriate blogs can help students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can determine their position on other people's writing and provide insights into their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's glamorous twin capital, and it is home to a wide variety of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south, Niagara Falls, and to the north, the Muskoka Mountains and beyond, an area of untouched natural beauty.
All of the above and more highlights Ontario as a distinct Canadian destination for foreigners.
The large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and in some places almost uninhabited wildlife.
For a surprisingly large population comparison, the United States has more African-Americans than citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest continent in area and is virtually isolated in terms of its fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are linked to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that women travellers, regardless of their marital status, state that they are married.
Also, wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, they may be doing something that they consider to be harassment, and it's not uncommon to be stalked, grabbed, etc.
Say no to men firmly and don't be afraid to stick to your guns (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Maronites used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan Daru I-Badyana, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca
Casablanca is one of the most unattractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as backpacks, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of different utensils, but all of this is for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by a lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the downtown area.
The Commission has also been consulted by the FTC on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations on the implementation of the FTC's recommendations.
It is also a base from which to climb Nyiragongo, and it offers the best opportunities for observing the mountain gorillas of Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-bodat (motorcycle taxi).
The combination of this comparative difficulty of accessibility has led to the use of Timbuktu as a metaphor for exotic, distant places.
Timbuktu is a poor city, although its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of desert lions.
It was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "The Wonder of the African World".
Compared to other cities in the country, it's completely different, because it has an Arabic rather than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African parks, daily nature protection and entry fees apply.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows access to certain South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider to be a major attraction.
The line of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to the glowing tulip patterns that emerge from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kwloon coast across from it.
A large part of Hong Kong Island's urban development projects are located in dense coastal upland areas.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of colonial occupation of the territory.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the remaining part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But forests are not just for mangroves - they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges basin.
Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or salinity.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has also been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 star-nosed vultures now inhabit the area.
Buses leave from the Inland Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and robust Japanese shore buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paros (150 Nu) and Punakha (Nue 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers reach a height of 273 feet [83 m], the bridge is 1,900 feet [378 m] long, and it has two 12-foot [3.5 m] wide lanes.
The bridge has a clearance of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group to settle in the lowlands of present-day eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic life of hunting and agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, the meeting of Spanish conquistadors and natives produced Paraguay, formerly known as the giant province of the Indies.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character.
It is well known that the Argentine water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and competitions are held here at other times of the year.
Tournament news and tickets for polo matches can be found on the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkish pound (FKP), which is set at the same value as one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite FIC West Shopping.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted at Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; consult with the owners before making a payment to determine what is appropriate.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures over +30 °C during the summer months are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity make the hours colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals have become accustomed to seeing people, they are still wildlife and should not be disturbed.
Park officials say bears and wolves should be kept at least 100 yards away and all other wildlife 25 yards away!
No matter how calm they may appear, the bison, the bison, the deer, the bear, and the peacock can all be attacked by large animals.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they didn't keep their distance, and these are large, wild, potentially dangerous animals, so give them the space they need.
Also, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of the infamous Naval Dispute of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser sank, killing about 200 Americans and Germans.
During the freedom struggle led by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the killing of Lealof III, the grand chief of Tupua Tamase.
Because Auckland is bordered by two harbors, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay (south) to Denvonport (south).
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and in most of them tall iron-clad trees provide shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and central Auckland's St Heliers.
These are family-friendly beach destinations lined with a selection of good shopping, and swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not complex but is pleasant and refreshing in taste.
French wine may be plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, flat white coffee is a foreign concept. Short black is espresso, while cappuccino is served with lots of cream (not wax) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and it is rare for any of them to cause injury to the reef.
However, listen to the authorities, follow all signs, and heed safety warnings.
The chestnut occurs near beaches and estuaries from October to April 1770 north of the town of the same name. Occasionally they can be found outside the period mentioned.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the ocean, but their main habitat is in the river basins north of Rockhampton.
Booking a room gives the passenger the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can find other accommodation options, such as camping, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you want to reconsider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes and requests should be discussed first with the tour operator and not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, most participants choose to camp on site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be near the mall, you have to get there early to get your campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that while the main stages may no longer feature music, the festival may have other stages that play until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, because crossing the ice makes a rather loud noise for the nearby cabins.
St Petersburg cruises include time in the city.Cruise travellers are exempted from visa requirements (check conditions).
Usually, casinos make an effort to keep guests there as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible.
Usually they have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and not to leave.
Some places offer alcohol on a charge, but getting drunk can impair your judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who travels over high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive like you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall to get stuck in a short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or floating snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries and traffic is more or less constant throughout the year.
Africa's biggest tourist attraction is probably the safari, the highlight of the trip for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to a journey by land to discover the wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, will come close to the cars and standard equipment is sufficient to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes spotted and are easier to see with binoculars.
'A bush walk, hiking safari or 'footing' is an excursion of a duration of either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, the host of the 1964 Games, becomes the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation rules will not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to be held.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥13,000, and conventional tickets cost about ¥7000.
Kneading wet clothes helps them dry, and many hotels have irons and kneading tables that can be borrowed even if they are not in your room.
If you do not have a knitwear or do not want to wear knit socks, you may try using a saddle if one is available.
Be careful not to make the fabric too hot (which may cause itching or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective than others for specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it may take several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies and if you are worried, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter predators unknown in their home region.
Pests can contaminate food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy duty-free and excise goods from certain locations.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont introduces the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, passing through often isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp turns are common.
The speed limits are considerably lower than in the previous and subsequent parts  usually 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
But strangely enough, the cell phone service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the track, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and Bavarian ones are quite rich and varied, similar to those of Austria, the southern neighbour.
Fruit sacks are the norm, with apples being baked into sacks throughout the year and cherries and plums making their first harvest in the summer.
Many German bakeries also use almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some hard, rich pastry, try the pastry called berliner, pfannkuchen, or krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with either meat or vegetables.
The curry can be dry or liquid, depending on the volume of liquid.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal peninsular areas, it is commonly used in coconut milk.
Indonesian cuisine is a broad term that encompasses a wide selection of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country, allowing you to choose from among 17,000 islands.
But when used without any additional qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is widely available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes, and Javanese favorites include peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The legs on either side of the saddle are designed to support the rider's legs.
These help the rider maintain balance, but can be dangerous because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his leg is caught in the leg, it may be possible that the horse will drag him away in a race.
First, most riders wear a saddle with a saddle and saddle, a rather narrow saddle.
Next, some saddles, especially English ones, have protective pads that allow the leg to escape from the saddle when the rider pulls it back.
The Cochamo Valley, Chile's main climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, is home to a variety of large granite rock walls and cliffs.
From the tops of the mountain ranges, breathtaking views are revealed, and climbers from all over the world are constantly digging new routes into the rock walls of this infinite potential.
Mountain sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of standing on snow-covered ground on sloping ski trails or on snow.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, occasionally known as ski-bums, who plan their entire vacation around skiing in one particular location.
Skiing is very old - skiers are depicted in cave paintings dating back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Mountaineering as a sport was practiced as early as the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also known as wild skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to, but does not usually include, rock climbing or mountaineering, which is usually done on steeply sloping terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski raft as a kind of a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat more distance than walking, but even on well-maintained tracks, you rarely reach the speed of a cross-country run that would be comparable to riding without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and traveling through several countries usually involves several visits to visa and passport control.
But in this matter, the Schengen area acts somewhat like one country.
As long as you stay within that zone, you can basically cross the border without going through the passport controls again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for one visa for each Schengen Member State separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique goods, although some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are over 100 years old.

In a backflow current, the current bounces back from the shore, often from a pen or something like it.
Because of the underlying landforms, the backflow moves to a couple of deeper spots, and there may be a rapid current that flows into the deep water.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue while swimming against the tide, because it can be an impossible task.

Satellite phones do not usually replace cell phones, since to make a phone call you must be outside, in full view of the satellite.
The service is often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, but also by expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.

Finland is a great destination for boating, and the so-called land of a thousand lakes also has a thousand islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to sail between islands and lakes.
While the archipelagos and larger lakes on the coast are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where one boat is used for every seven to eight people.
Equivalent figures are found in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but the phenomenon is otherwise unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most varied Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you have a couple of full days to visit the historic city, while you can return to the ship for the night and sleep there.

For some, understanding the principles of flight and what happens in flight can help overcome the fear of the unknown or of lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of packages, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Some routes have their own planes for the big companies, but other routes and smaller companies had problems.
When goods were shipped by air, it could take days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it in a checked bag, which the airline rules don't allow them to do without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class is to pay a lot of money for that luxury (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
But it is not cheap: As a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times as much for business class and 11 times as much for first class as for a standard tourist class!
In general, it is not even worthwhile to look for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
The airlines know very well that there is a group of air travelers who are willing to pay a large sum for the luxury of flying somewhere quickly and comfortably, and who charge a price for it.
