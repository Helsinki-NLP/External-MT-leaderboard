The whalers were worried about the appearance of the mammoth.
Some AMs are upset about the suggestion to change their title to MWPS (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It arose because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The entire political spectrum was worried that it would be a laughingstock.
1 One worker said that his group was concerned that TWP and PWP2 matched.
Whales for readers outside of the 1st: Whales TWP means stupid and PWP means stupid.
Plaid AM said the whole group was not happy and suggested alternatives.
Welles conservatively said his group name was open-minded about the change, but noted that Muppets were literally jumping off the MPWP.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English letter U.
The Commissioner of the Legislative Assembly, who drafted the law for name change, said: "Any description of what the members of the Legislative Assembly will be told will be the final decision of the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found broad support for the Assembly being called the Parliament of Wales.
In the matter of the title of AM the Commission favoured the Whale Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
The AM appears to suggest alternatives, but getting a consensus for the authorized officer, Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit a rough draft of the law on the changes within a week, could be a headache.
The amendment will include in the manner in which the Legislative Assembly functions, rules for disqualification of AM and other related changes, including design of committee system.
When they discuss the legislation, they will have the final say on the question of what they should be called.
Macedonian people will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The famous referendum was held to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has territory known as Macedonia.
Athens had long maintained that the name of their northern neighbor represented a claim to its territory and repeatedly objected to its bids for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would not consider the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Chief Minister Zoran Zeev, argued that the name change was simply the price paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's had become quiet as churches in Harlem were in trouble.
Historically, the elderly people I spoke to said there were bars and churches on every corner, Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is no Kai.
He said that Bar's disappearance was understandable.
"People socialize differently these days", he said.
Now there will not be long bars next to residential houses where people go regularly.
Because he was worried for the churches that the money from the property sales wouldn't last as long as the leaders wanted, and sooner or later they would end up back where they started.
He added that condominium apartment buildings filled with people who do not help the remaining holy places in the neighborhood could replace churches.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people", he said, "and therefore the day is not far off when these churches will be closed completely because most of the people who come to these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the Black Metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in the year 1870, decades after St. Martin's.
The original white Methodist congregations were gone by 1930.
Black congregations praying nearby occupied the building.
St. Martin was occupied by black congregations led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted retail shopkeepers on 125th Street, the main street of shopping in Harlem, who objected to keeping or encouraging black people.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, but Father Johnson's clergy began to ring the bells as they planned to do reconstruction work.
Father Johnson's father, the Rev. David Johnson, and St. Martin's successors proudly identified the bell as the poor man's bell.
The experts who rang the bell in July called it something else: "cultural treasures" and "irreplaceable historical instruments".
A specialist from the University of Michigan, Tiffenheine N.G. noted that it was the first event in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had been attending a riverside church in the big carollion 18 years earlier.
Mr Meriwether said that St Martin did not replace him.
What had been happening with St. Martin's for the last few months was a story of complex sculptors and contractors, some brought in by raw church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
WESTRE - The parish governing body, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese, while seeking to pass the bill, was not involved in retaining the sculptors and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some priests complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A 13-year-old man was injured by a shark in a lobster dive in California.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for crabs on Saturday, the first day of the crab season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammell told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and then he paddled over to the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a crayfish, but then he realized that it was screaming, I understood a little bit!
I realized a little!
Her entire pelvis was opened, and Hamel said that when she found the boy, she was distracted.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " Hamel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Life guard Captain Larry Gilles told the media that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not an endangered species of shark.
Gillis added that the victim sustained serious injuries to the upper part of the leg.
Investigation and security purposes officers closed the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Isinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's plans pushed the UK beauty market
Sensbury is keeping Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams in the department store with stylish beautician assistants.
As a lasting push into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, where fashion and homewear sales were declining and increasingly so, a major beauty product will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, taken to more stores.
Investments in beauty are used as ways to use the storage spaces that are kept for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of the beauty items it offers to up to 3,000 items, including Revlon, Essai, Twizerman and Dr. Pauppa for the first time.
L'Oreal's current ranges Maybelline and Bruts Biz will also find more space in branded areas like the ones found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that most of the items are vegan-friendly - which is increasingly in demand among small shoppers.
In addition, two Sainsbury's stores will experiment with discounting fragrance shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while the second is due to open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and buying small quantities of daily food from local convenience stores means that supermarkets will have to do a lot to keep people visiting.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Cope, said that stores will look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to repay the discounting elderly and elderly by offering more services and non-food items.
Sanberris has been running Argos shops in thousands of stores since it launched both chains two years ago and has launched a number of settlements, which it says have provided support to grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to improve their beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the alliance ended on how to distribute part of the revenues from the chemist's store in their supermarkets.
New strategies followed three years ago when Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Malik Celesio of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain for £125 million.
He said the four stores will play a role in the event by expanding their luxury range of skincare brands, including Lloyds La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have improved the look and feel of our beauty products to enhance the atmosphere for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be helpful in advising.
Our brand range is destined to meet all needs and pleasing atmosphere and convenient places, that is, we are now the destination for beauty products that challenge the old fashioned way of shopping.
Peter Jones was sacked after Holly Willoughby pulled a £11 million deal.
When TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled a £11 million deal, Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was forced to do his lifestyle brand business with Mark and Spencer and ITV.
Villaghai doesn't really have time for its own homeware and accessories brand.
The Pears' business was combined with the Gwyneth Pellthroes Group brand.
This morning the 37-year-old presenter took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
In the final, Holly Willows put Dragon's Den star Peter Jones in trouble by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her new big contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was appalled when the TV golden girl admitted in a tense meeting at her empire headquarters in Merlo Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she had made new deals worth £1.5 million - meaning she really didn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand.
The business was like Gwyneth Paltrow's Group brand and was worth twice the estimated £11 million fortune of Willoughby.
Since Willowby, 37, used Instagram to announce she was leaving, Jones has been moving out of Britain to go to one of her holiday homes.
Sources said: "It was indeed the highest priority of Holi till now.
It was going to be her long-term future in which she could see herself for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, how close it was to the beginning.
The warehouse at Merlo headquarters was packed full of supplies ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure this morning of the presenter, one of Britain's most trusted stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy delays in a range of items from kitchens and candles to clothing and homeware, and could delay future launches.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Dan Baldwin Jones, a mother of three and a husband, and his wife, Tara, were close to Cap for over ten years.
Villaghai actually set up the setup in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
With some exceptions, Galle and Jones own a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby became the brand ambassador for M&S and will be replacing Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
Sources close to Jones said that "we did not comment on his business dealings last night".
We had a tough talk and then we fell in love.
He joked that the news media would criticize him for making comments, some would call him "unexpected" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump do all this?
Trump said it in a newscaster's voice.
I have done nothing wrong.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump arranged an opening meeting in Singapore in June, a major step toward denuclearising North Korea.
But, the negotiations to release the nuclear broke down.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top envoy RI Yong Ho told the UN's General Assembly of global leaders on Saturday that North Korea was not seeing a "relevant response" from the US over North Korea's early disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. has begun to grant targeted approvals to keep up the pressure.
Trump displayed a great deal of optimism during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were heading for war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now, we have this wonderful relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded good results - rocket tests stopped, hostages were freed, and the remaining US troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to get the presidency, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get in from this closed battlefield, we have 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing thousands.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told not to do so.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, so, it was a bit challenging", Ms. Sumbeng said.
While Save the Children is trying to get to Palau, it is not certain whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Agency said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can be given a reprieve to contribute to the relief efforts.
Indonesia is woefully unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature, given the way the earth is constantly shaking.
This scene is not commonly seen in coastal areas when tsunami shelters are built in Ise.
Although the warning is in effect, there is obviously a possibility of loss of life due to the lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu.
At best, traveling to many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make systems more complex.
A hospital ship to treat earthquake victims is in Lombok, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a major issue in his election campaign, and he spent heavily on roads and railways.
But, the lack of funds left Mr. Joko's administration in a quandary as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure due to lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced more conservative forms of worship.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge deep-dived the game of Barbaric v. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a 30-yard pass from Sheldon Shakiri when his team was 1-0 down from Chelsea.
He caught the ball with his left before firing a shot at the far post.
This attempt went off the top of the box as it hit the top right corner of the net.
Finally the balls jumped onto the cape of Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolIFC.COM.
I saw Kante coming and making a touch and I couldn't think too much about it and just put the shot in.
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time to Belgian star Aiden Hazard after scoring in the 25th minute.
Metu Kovasiakan passed that game again before the blue striker stopped spinning in the middle of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic was giving away quickly in the middle of the field.
Then he threw a nice ball, which propelled the Hazard into the box.
Hazard was out of defence and ended up in the net of the far post through a left-foot shot and outstripped Liverpool's Alison Baker.

UEFA Europe will face Chelsea at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and waves as high as 20 feet caused many people to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that were brought down, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380000 people, was filled with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman dies
A murder investigation was launched after the woman's body was found on Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found with a wound at 7.55am on John Street in Grayson Moss, arrested on suspicion of murdering a 32-year-old man.
Police had requested anyone in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the preliminary stages but I would urge anyone who is in the vicinity of the Johan Street area in Birkenhead to contact us who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have caught anything in the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local of Birkenhead and that she had been found inside the property.
Friends who thought they knew the woman this afternoon came to the scene this morning to ask questions about where she had been.
The investigation is underway as police said they are in the process of informing the next of kin of the victim.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mewes was still trying to get back to his flat when he was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he realized what had happened, he could not say anything.
Now residents have been told that it will take hours to allow them to go inside.
The police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being seen as a crime scene.
A woman with tears was seen at the scene.
She kept saying that it was very hateful.
Two police vans were inside the cordoned area at 2 pm and one van was outside.
A number of officers were standing inside the blockade, watching over the blocks of flats.
Anyone with information was asked to inform DM@MerPolCC, call 101 or contact CrimeStoppers anonymously by referring to 30th September Log 247 on 0800 555 111.
The statue of Cromwell Parliament has become a famous modern memorial for rewriting history.
His exile would be poetic justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works, such as the Taliban, created by his religious holy followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate over the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster cannot be avoided.
The iconoclasms of the English Civil War were neither ordered nor drawn by Cromwell.
Perhaps his ancestor Thomas would have been falsely blamed for Cromwell's actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornecroft's unique representation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century vision and a part of the chronicle of a personality that many still consider important to celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was remembered as the guardian of Parliament against many external pressures, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, in his case certainly the monarchy.
Whether or not it is an accurate representation is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain that the Partition of the mid 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a commendable figure who represented one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
The killer pig moles the Chinese farmer dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
A man identified only by his surname Yun was found near a stay Sunday morning after a report of a man with a broken artery and covered in blood at the Liupanshuai market in the Guizhou area of southern China.
A pig farmer on a hoggy prepares to give a vaccination injection to pigs in the Xining of Qinghai region of China on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly came from the Yunnan area with his nephew on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, her cousin saw her dead, and found the door to the neighbor's pigsty open.
He said that the big pig in the stew had blood in its mouth.
Forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin's leg was bloodied and dismembered, his cousin, referring to him as his surname, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yao entering the market to feed his pigs at 4.40am on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed her was not her own or her father's.
When police gathered evidence from the scene, the market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent anyone from attacking.
Yun's family and the market authorities were found to be negotiating compensation for the death.
Although an exception, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a bear attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound donkey whale filled a farmer's tractor until his wife moved away, scaring the whale.
After his pig ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can make him sick.
They are just playful.
They're nipers, very curious... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect that they deserve", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern U.S. extensively.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes through the cold waters of the galaxy.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph at 5 a.m. as of Sunday, Eastern Time, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
By then, the Pacific Ocean crater has begun to take shape and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. Rosa will arrive as a tropical storm on the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, pushing deep tropical moisture northward across the southwestern U.S.
Rosas will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subtropical wet weather will then bring extensive heavy rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause dangerous flooding conditions, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause 2 to 3 inches of rainfall every hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The sporadic nature of the tropical rains is likely to bring sudden floods with catastrophic conditions.
The advice to venture out into the desert on foot under the threat of tropical rain would be considered quite bad.
Heavy rains can cause valleys to become flowing rivers and storms to bring local gusty winds and flying dust.
The arriving trophy will bring some local heavy rain along the coast of Southern California.
A cool half inch of rain is likely which could cause small garbage streams and narrow roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the area.
Some sporadic rain showers will begin arriving in Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before becoming more extensive on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to four corners on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
Throughout the U.S. some severe temperature fluctuations may be seen in October as the northern hemisphere is cooling, but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in a short period of time.
Sunday is the best example of a dramatic change in temperature in the central U.S.
There is a difference of about 20 degrees in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to rise and spread again.
Much of the central and western U.S. will see a warm start in October that will reach 80°C broadly across parts of the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that there is a high probability of above average temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first quarter of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing was watched by more than 20 million people.
Thursday's testimony on Brett Kavanaugh, who filed nominations for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey, who accused her of sexually assaulting her in 1980, was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Broadcasters, meanwhile, began a political stand-off: a contract drawn up by Arizona Sen. I. Jack Flake will conduct a week-long investigation of charges for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had caught her drunk and tried to undress her at a secondary school party.
Kavanaugh, in a hurried testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it as reported by Eva Nielsen.
The company had average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, which showed that.
And Nielsen usually had some trouble-measuring people who looked in the offices.
To put it in perspective, this audience was the size of a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of the hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the hearing, the interest was more.
Friday's drama had a person in the center of the flea.
After the Central Republican Office issued a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught barking at protesters by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as he was heading to the elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes down for a few minutes as it was being produced, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
She was told, "You have power while many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the lift closed that he had a lot to tell the hearing committee.
All cable and broadcast networks were covering hours of live broadcasts as the entire Senate was voting on the nomination of Kavanaugh by the Judiciary Committee for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI would investigate next week the allegations against the nominee, which minority Democrats had been requesting.
Flake was somewhat taken in by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coon.
After conversations with Coons and some of the senators who followed him, Flake made his decision.
Flake had the power in the election because, it seemed, the Republicans could not allow the riot to go on without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British PM could accuse critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May may face charges of playing politics with Britain's future and ignoring national interests in return for her criticism of the EU over her exit from the Times newspaper.
Prime Minister Theresa May may visit the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In an interview after her interview on the front page of the newspaper, she attacked her previous foreign minister, Boris Johnson, for telling her Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the UK and EU's proposal to collect each other's tariffs was "totally unreasonable".
Ved Sims shooting: police arrested suspect Dayton Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police arrested the 20-year-old basketball player, Wade Sims, at the LSU after the suspect was fatally shot.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims' glasses were lost during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WFAB reports.
After questioning Sivassan, the police said he confessed to shooting Waid in a brutal manner.
His bond was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Corner office issued a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head from inside the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and the civilians who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrests.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alewa thanked area law enforcement for their continued "commitment and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Boughton Rose where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "dismantled" and "in a state of shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what you are always worried about, " Veda said.
The volcano blew ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepette volcano reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Management on Saturday warned Mexican residents to stay away from the volcano for 24 hours after activity intensified at the volcano's mouth and 183 gas and ash vents began to be released.
The Centre was monitoring multiple sounds and vibrations.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car vents in a Mexico City neighborhood like Xochimilco.
Geologists reported increased activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police clashed with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined a revenge demonstration on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation over the split.
A group of masked people supporting the separatists were pushed back by riot police, who threw eggs and sprayed paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets normally packed with tourists.
The crowd also dispersed later in the day after the police used their batons to stop the clash.
For hours, anti-independence groups chanted "no apologies, no apologies", to which the totalitarian protesters responded by chanting, "Spain live forever".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protest, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence sector even a year after the October 1 referendum, a referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to remain independent, however, as those who opposed the split largely abstained from voting, the turnout was low.
According to some authorities, last year, in all the areas of violent clashes, about 1000 people were injured after the police tried to stop people from voting at polling booths.
Anti-independence groups pitched tents outside late Friday to stop protests in favor of the national police.
There were demonstrations but they had to take a different path.
68-year-old Narcisse Termes, an electrician who participated with her wife in the separatist protests, said she had no hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we lived our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote but now we are trapped", she said.
Despite the special arrangement of regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties have struggled to sustain that frenzy this year as many of their best-known leaders have either been exiled themselves or are in custody awaiting trial for their role in convening a referendum and then declaring independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded pro-police protesters on his phone, said the split was instigated by politicians from both parties.
"It was becoming more and more stressful", she said.
Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to re-establish democratic values and to denounce the repression we have faced from the Spanish government", she said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car breaks into house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being repeatedly driven into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Belyanadgarh Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blamming, who investigated, said the doors and the building were also damaged.
Sometimes a crossbow can catch fire with a car.
Menga Strike gives Livingstone a 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Mangan's first goal for Livingstone ensured victory
The excited Livingstone surprised the Rangers as it was only Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mangan's strike proved to be the difference between the two as Gray Holt's team was out a level ahead of Hibernian in seconds.
The Gerrards were one win away from victory this season in the Premiership and will face the leaders, who are eight points behind them, on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
By then Livingston will have continued their undefeated streak in the six-game division, with Holt yet to taste defeat after replacing head coach Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone will lose chances against visitors without a edge
Holt's team should have been way ahead even before they scored, their directionlessness causing problems for the Rangers in every way.
Scott Robinson was completely crushed but kept his efforts against the goal, then only Allan Lithgow was able to draw his effort after sliding Craig Holcett's header to meet the goal.
The hosts had the material to let the Rangers play against them, knowing they could put the visitors in trouble piecemeal.
And so the important goal came.
The Rangers accepted the free-kick and Livingstone worked on the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to set up the puck that touched and scored from the middle of the box.
Up to that point, the Rangers had maintained a grip on the possession but the home defense was lacking and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had largely nothing to do.
This continued to be the case in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos was forced to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the foot of Ranger goalkeeper Allan MacGregor and the Livingston player Lithgow hit a wide for the game.
Livingstone's box was constantly crossed and he was also constantly out for a penalty to push a handball away after challenging the supplier Glenn Middleton with a halcutt.
"Extraordinary" by Livingstone - Analysis by the author
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lemont on the playing field of Tony McAuro
Extraordinary look and result by Livingstone.
For a man, they were amazing, and the expectations were starting to rise.
His style of play and players have changed little since he was at his best, but he is credited with the way he has handled the team since the Holt.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halcett handled the beautifully arranged defense very well while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell in check.
However, the Rangers were less motivated.
They were good as long as they were under Gerard, they fell short of his standards.
Their final ball was lacking - only once did they open the home team - and it was time to wake up for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiles and a brown sky were on the faces as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They raised issues including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then proceeded to Kolokne for the inauguration of the new large mosque.
It is the city with the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but several supporters gathered nearby to see their leader.
The thousands of protesters opposing Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - were also echoed by both the police and the German government's decision to include him in the country.
The duelist's protest depicted the visitor's acclaim as a hero by some German Turks as divisive and his disgrace as an autocrat by others.
Deportford Road Crash: A cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place at about 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the southeast area of the city.
The driver of the car was standing and paramedics examined him, but the man was dead on the scene.
The collision came a month after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Children's Street, about a mile away from the collision on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted and motorists have been advised to avoid this route.
Long Larin Prison: Six officers injured in chaos
Six prison officers were injured after unrest in a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.2
A breakdown occurred at HMP Long Lartine in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
To quell the unrest, expert Tornado Officers have been brought in which includes eight housemates and a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
Specifically trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the problem of MMP Long Lartin, said a spokesperson of the jail service.
Six members of the crew were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may be sent to jail for a long time.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most notorious criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last year, riot control officers were called to the jail in October to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are under threat of flash flooding due to Hurricane Rosa (drought affected areas may benefit)
Tropical pressure rarely hits Arizona, but something like this is going to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa tracks its path across the southwestern desert, creating the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and western Arizona, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, has already set up a watch for the flooding in Oconto for Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Rosa is expected to take a direct route to Phoenix, which will arrive with rain later on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only ten tropical storms have made landfall within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane located within 40 miles of the AZ border.
Advanced National Hurricane Center models have predicted rainfall of up to 6 inches, with 2 to 4 inches scattered along the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other desert areas of the southwest including the central Rockies and Great Basin have expressed the possibility of rainfall up to 4 inches with 1 to 2 inches of intermittent rainfall.
Of all the hazards of flash floods, the rain of dew can be a blessing as the region is suffering from drought.
Although the floods are a cause of great concern, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the south-west is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second-largest category, as reported by weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With maximum winds of 85 mph with hurricane capacity, Rosa is still 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 mph on Sunday morning.
The storm is coming into contact with cold water in the Pacific and is therefore decreasing in intensity.
Thus, it is expected that a tropical storm at the speed of sound will make landfall in Mexico by late afternoon or evening on Monday.
Heavy rainfall across Mexico, causing a risk of severe flooding.
3 to 6 inches of cool rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with a chance of up to 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then make a northward path across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, then making its way southward through Arizona and into Utah by Tuesday night.
Erosa or its remnants are expected to cause major damage by very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. southwestern desert, the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the desert and mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested in connection with attempted murder
A 16-year-old man in Somerset has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man after being found with a gunshot wound.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were taken into custody overnight in the Redstock area of Avon, and Somerset police said.
The officials have requested anyone with mobile phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh suffered, that is, the wrath of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the Democratic Party's rigid and offensive tactics", Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh endured the "minus, the rage" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Before Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, Christine Blais forcefully and emotionally denied allegations by Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when she was a teenager.
Ford was also examined during the hearing on the allegations.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day, the American people showed brilliance and quality and the courage of the Kavanaugh.
"A vote for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for confirmation of the most accomplished legal mind of our time, a jurist with a proven record of public service", he told a supportive crowd in West Virginia.
The President specifically referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as the key to turning the Republican side in the mid-term elections.
Five weeks away from the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, she said.
That is why I am fighting for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the House on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Thousands of people have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the number is still rising
When an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people died, with many more stranded as large waves hit the coast, authorities said Saturday.
When a six-meter (18-foot) wave washed ashore on the beach in Paul's town late Friday evening, thousands of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, dragging several people to their deaths and destroying everything in its path.
A tsunami followed the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the coast and did not immediately flee and became victims", Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB spokesperson, Sutoyo Purwo Nugroho, said in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come on its own, it hit cars, logs, houses, land, whatever it hit it hit, " said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open ocean at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the pool has been turned and broken and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The quake began to shake the coastal city on Saturday
The earthquake's series of shocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in its statement that the energy released by Friday's devastating earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical situation of the city, which is bordered by a long narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
The damage was described as "extensive" by Nugroho, who said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the roofs of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that an additional 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugraho said that the area known as Donggala, 300 km (190 mi) off the northern coast of Palu, which is close to the epicentre of the earthquake, could have caused more loss of life and property.
The communication system in Donggala is "completely broken, no information", Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in its statement, adding that staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could get worse", he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
Footage released on social media shows a man on the top floor of the building shouting a warning to people down the street that a tsunami is coming.
In minutes, the walls of water hit the shore and washed away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to confirm the instant footage.
The earthquake and tsunami released a massive amount of energy that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with aid materials from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the evacuees still desperately need food and basic necessities.
The city airport has been opened for relief work only and will remain closed till October.
President Joko Widodo on Sunday organized a visit to the relief centers.
The death toll from the Indonesia tsunami has reached 800.
It's too bad.
While World Vision employees safely reached the city of Palu from Donggala where they were given shelter in the courtyard of their office in the shelters of Tadaptry, they saw scenes of disaster along the way, said Mr Doseba.
"They told me how many houses they saw that were destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups started disaster relief operations, some complained that even highly skilled foreign aid workers were prevented from entering the Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only come if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional crisis", said Aulia Arrianani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, 'OK, this is a national emergency,' we can open up international aid but it's not there yet.
The night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday was Paul's second night, and friends and family who were still missing were sitting there hoping that their loved ones would be left with miracles or stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the corpse of her mother who had been lying beside her for two days.
Jendron Subandone, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games who were recruited from Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the others stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, the ones Mr. Mandagi included were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon again recalled how the news was given to the paragliding community hours after the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed, sending a vivid WhatsApp message to Palu Harifo, who was attending the Beach Festival.
However, his message contained only one grey check instead of two brown ones.
"I think it means the message didn't get through", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while loading an ATM at Newport in Levy
Thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning at the Newport on Levy when Brink's workers were filling an ATM, according to a news release issued by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car at the entertainment complex was emptying the ATM and preparing to pay more money.
While he was busy, another man ran behind the Brink's employee and stole the bag for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information regarding his identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Y
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to -ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and used the moniker title for his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on the Saturday night live show where she is set to launch her new album Yandy.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show which was cancelled for "emotional reasons", the show's creators said.
As well as being an acronym for his current occupation, West had previously said that the word had religious significance to him.
"I think that 'ye' is a word that's used a lot in the Bible and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year when discussing his album Big Boy Sy.
So, I am you, I am we, it is we.
He removed the kenny that only meant one thing, that only showed us our good, our bad, our mess everyone.
This album sheds more light on what we are.
He is one of a number of rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P Diddy, or Diddy, but released his choice name this year as Love and Brother Love.
A previous West collaborator, Jay-Z, also did Hyphen with or without a capital.
The AMLO of Mexico has pledged not to use the military against any civilian.
President-elect of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the bloody uprising against the students.
Lopez Obrador will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday.
While the leftist student movement was taking root throughout Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on protesters holding a peaceful demonstration on the plaza, killing about 300 people at the time.
López Orbador vowed to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead youth to move into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its AI funding.
With China becoming more prolific in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research it does in that area, says Kai-Fu Li, an investigator and AI practitioner who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
There were comments from various parts of the US government after the AI announcement, even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China laid out its plan last year: it aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Considering that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, and we look forward to the next breakthrough in AI", Li said.
Doubling the funding would double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by the CEO of Shinovation Ventures, Houghton Miffin Harcourt, invested in China's most important AI company, Face++.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that could defeat the US's top-ranked Othello player, and was subsequently an executive at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China branch.
Lee welcomed the previous US government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's technology competition, the Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants, Lee said.
It's not China that's taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited bright people from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. increase its AI efforts, Lee said.
I think that those who have done their PhD in AI should be given automatic green cards.
China's State Council released its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund U.S. researchers, China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry partners and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For NFS it currently invests more than $100 million annually for AI research.
Until then, no action had been seen for months in U.S. law to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonians voted on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that had stalled its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says the name of its northern neighbor reflects its claim to territory and its vetoed entry into NATO and the EU.
In June the two governments struck a deal on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Selvic majority population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov had said he would not vote for the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum would come out to vote.
Question: Did you accept the Treaty with Greece and gain membership in NATO and the EU?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zev, argued that it was fair to pay the price for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, and for its inclusion in institutions such as NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us", said Oliveira Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of the House said they would abide by the result of the vote to reach a decision.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The state Election Commission said that as of 1 pm there were no reports of irregularities.
However, in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66% of the total registered voters cast their ballots, only 16% of the total voters turned out to vote, compared to 34%.
"I came out to vote because my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old voter Gjosos Tnevski in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško cast their votes in a referendum to change the name of the country of Macedonia to pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Karvadarkov was preparing a small stage and arranging chairs in front of tents set up by the people who boycotted the referendum.
We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through a service of service, said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we are a happy one.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can become like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zeev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour of it because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zev said after casting his vote in the ballot box.
He said that the results will determine our future.
Polls released by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - less than required.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV on Sunday found that 57 percent of respondents were considering voting.
Of those, 70 percent said yes they would vote.
A referendum needs 50 plus one vote to be successful.
The failure of the referendum will be the first blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took over power last May 2.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates the entire Bregton defense for a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were the two who stunned the defence of Brighton at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England on Saturday in a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguero made his score in the 65th minute look ridiculously easy.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders before hitting an open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
Brighton bounced around a defender before outrunning him a few more times.
Then, he gave a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give Aguero the ball back which he used his right boot with a shot to the right of the net to knock out Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero was experiencing some problems with his leg, city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
55, 60 minutes we talked about his game.
It has happened.
We were lucky to score him at that time".
But it was Stirling who benefited the Sky Blues in the early days of the Premier League scandal.
A goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in Brighton Deep in that game.
He sent the ball through a beautifully thrown to Leroy Seyne with a left flank.
Seyen touched a few before leading the curling on the far post.
The Sky Blues sent the ball over the net before it could be carried further out of the boundary.
Hoffenheim city fights take place in the Champions League group at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Schinsheim, Germany on Tuesday at 12:55.
The Rockies want to play Shaz against the Spoilers.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was no good reason to force another start.
But the always competitive Shazers are hoping for a round against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, even if only to have a playoff impact for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies are confirmed wild-card spots with at least a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to lock-up their first-class title.
Even if we're not playing to achieve anything, at least we can toss the rubber, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and other teams will probably play to the highest level of any of this year's encounters.
Why would I not want to compete in it?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly in the process of letting Shazzer pitch in.
Shazer, who will be making his 34th start, will have a bullpen session on Tuesday and pitch on the remaining of his usual Sundays.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The President, while talking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections, mentioned the circumstances surrounding the selection of the Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court of Appeals.
Everything we did in November is at stake.
The most important election of our lifetime is five weeks away.
This is one of the big ones, the big -- I'm running but I'm really running so I'm fighting for the best performance everywhere".
Trump said, "You're looking at a terrible, desperate bunch of radicals in the Democrats, and it's happening right now.
And they are committed to reclaiming power by using whatever tools they can, you see the shallowness and the filth.
They don't know who they're actually hurting, and who they're crushing to gain power and control, so they want power and control, and we're not giving it to them".
Democrats are on a mission to "protest and stir up a barrier", he said.
And you see that over the last four days, he called the Democrats "angry and ugly and evil and untruthful".
He gave the rank of Democratic Sen. to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Dyan addressed the audience as Feinstein, which received a standing ovation.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hum, hum, what.
No, no, I'm waiting -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor is no longer a broad church.
It's intolerable for those who talk their minds.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly surprising.
And finally, I am the latest of the Labour MPs to say that you are not welcome - all of them are saying that for our own good.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar manner because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censor for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the same issues that caused the scandal.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Meetings on Friday said, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
As a local Labour MP for the majority of my eight years, Friday night GC meetings were the same.
Today, sadly, this is not the tone of many meetings and the essence of compassionate and humble politics has been forgotten long ago, but it has actually started.
It is clear from the foregoing that the Labour Party does not tolerate dissent and that every consultation is evaluated on the basis of what is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague with whom I had previously shared the same political view, they were expecting me to take a U-turn and to take positions I would never agree to, whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak at a public meeting - and it really makes no difference what I say - a sharp comment on social media is followed by calls to not elect me, to reject the politics of the Centre, to tell me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And my experience is not the same.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I am dedicated to the professionalism and determination of those professionals who face sexist and racist ideology on a daily basis but never feel ashamed.
The most frustrating aspect of this era of politics is the level of oppression that has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and the party is shrinking with every motion of no confidence or change of the rules of the election.
I have been advised many times in the last two years that I should focus on keeping my head down, not being so arrogant and then I would be embarrassed.
But this is not what I came into politics to do.
As a schoolboy 32 years ago when I joined the Labour Party, irritated by the Thatcher government's neglect of my broad school class, I sought support for the better public services for those who needed them most - whether it was as a local councillor or a government minister.
In the last election, I have never hidden my politics.
No way in Nottingham East could I have been confused in the field of policy views, and disagreements with the current leadership.
I would say to those who have been promoting the motion on Friday that as the country moves towards Brexit, it will hurt homes, businesses and our public services. I do not want to waste time and energy showing my loyalty to the Labour Party leaders.
But I have a message not just for the moment, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of being elected or political gain will interfere with my doing what I want to do and what is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayer 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayer goes to the top
Two delayed attempts may have greatly undermined the final result, but even the uncertainty was worth the effort to achieve an unprecedented victory in this incredible tenth match of the day.
Now it's at the top of the heap, the only undefeated party in the tenth.
In the end it was his excellent defence, as well as taking better chances by him, which gave the home team the lead and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be pleased.
He said, "We've tried this on our game, and today we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy".
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, replaced by Frazier Climo, put the A's on the front, but a yellow card for the Warriors allowed Marlowe to show the number for the Scottish cap Rory Hughes, released for the game, and Jason Negotogo's bat caught the unrequited attempt.
Climo extended the lead to Ayr with a penalty, scoring exactly before half-time and converting the lead to 17-5 in a solitary effort at the break.
But Melrose started the second attempt well and Patrick Ederson's attempt was converted by Bagot to reduce the independence by five points.
Rudi then suffered a serious knee injury, which was given a stretch and then restarted, with a converted effort by Climo pushing Stafford McDowell further ahead of Ayre.
When Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow-card, Melrose paid off the extra man with a wild Bruce Clovin effort at the end of a serious pressing.
However the home-side came back and when Straw Hutchinson was given a yellow card for reaching Clem without a ball with a penalty line-out, McPherson was touched by the back of the Adyer Mall.
The climate changed, as the car was rebooted by Mahdasht, with Kelly Rowe collecting David Armstrong after sending Flanker Gregor Henry for Homer's fifth attempt.
Even now, Khelno Tarlo seems to be setting himself up for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Now the star of the game, Ford Kearns is ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been nominated for the position of director of a licensed restaurant.
Jack Jarvis, 56, stars in the popular BBC show, which he is writing and co-starring with long-time comedy partner Greg Bumphill.
The two have announced that the show will end with the next ninth series and it seems that Keiran Craigleigh is planning for the afterlife.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, but a Scottish Sun source has indicated that Kiran is looking to get into the successful restaurant business in Glasgow.

From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the sea is our official sea.
It is a duty to recover it".
The memory of a coastal land lost to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still burning - as if the Pacific Ocean wants to flow once again.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Cajajila said that there is a sense of unity and peace in Bolivia, and there is certainly hope for a positive outcome.
As many Bolivians across the country watch the ICG decision on big screens, it is hoped that the Tribunal in The Hague will see in favor of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of volatile negotiations - Chile is committed to negotiating a sovereign outlet to Bolivia in the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's miraculously indigenous president - who faces a controversial fight for reelection next year - has several rides on Monday's ruling.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific, we took the oath at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision in Bolivia's favor is unlikely - and if it does, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN has no power to cede territory to Chile, and it is determined that this will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiation.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, said that the ICJ's decision comes six months after hearing the final arguments, indicating that the matter was not complicated.
The removal of Bolivia from the past four years may set this back.
The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zorte said.
He advised that the aggressive statements of Morales have stripped Chile of any inherent goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will never stop talking about something, but after this it will be difficult to discuss.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making by the court was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring a unique opportunity for Bolivia to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and for Chile to end 139 years of mutual disagreement with consensus, he said.
Calzadia also denied that Morales - still the most popular of Latin American presidents - used the maritime issue as a political base.
Bolivia has never renounced its right to reach the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The ruling party tries to show that they need to move beyond the past.
North Korea says denuclearization will not happen until it trusts the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not take the initiative to destroy nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington.
Ri was addressing the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the leaders to implement the promises made at the Summit in Singapore.
His comments come as the US is feeling Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to resume a nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un after more than three months of standoff in Singapore.
Ri says this is a "pipe dream" that will keep sanctions and US opposition going and bring the North to its knees any time it decides to end the Korean War.
Washington is wary of Pyongyang agreeing to a declaration without implementing the first major disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country sees as its only option for ensuring security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Parish Fashion Show is a great way to showcase the latest style of headwear, so the High Street is right next to you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or want to block the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a series of unrivaled giant headgear for their SS19 collection on the road, which dazzled the styling set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, high-impractical hats have taken over Instagram and these designs under the catwalk have caught the eye.
The stand-out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top badge hat, decorated by a fan-like long brim, which covered the models' heads.
Other heavy-duty items included a pepper spray, a fancy hat and pineapple -- but they weren't designed to keep your head cool.
Thom Brown also revealed the strange mouth-wagging - and only for Halloween time.
Several colored heads were sewn on the mouth and the Haute Couture looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the Haute Couture.
One construction came with a snowball and black glasses to match the scuba diving gear, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And you publish a huge fashion statement -- you're lucky.
Those who keep an eye on style speculate that giant bonnets can make their way onto major roads.
The outer hat looks attractive on the high heeled shoes of La Bomba, the two-foot-long brick-tipped pual hat, which has appeared on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The most circulated hashtag on social media was the community label behind the unrealistic hat, sending a large composition down the catwalk - a pouch beach bag was as big as a swimsuit worn by a model.
The burnt orange raffia bag, with raffia fringing cut into a white leather handle on top, was a stand-out piece in the Jeanne La Riviera SS19 collection at Parisian Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope big hats and beach bags hit the high street next summer - because the designer has made such an impact that it's hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories".
Jon Edwards: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools accumulate a track record of academic excellence and have been consistently outstanding in 2018 with a set of excellent examination results, which are only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is providing the highest level of service to its students and parents.
The goal of the autonomous schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and to maintain their place as global citizens.
As a field of education that shapes and implements a school curriculum, we see that modern languages are uninterruptedly a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it is his understanding that is going to be given to you.
If you speak to him in his language, it will reach his heart".
When we want to build trust and build relationships with people from other countries, this is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone.
In the results of this year alone, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league rankings with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
68 of the total students studying foreign language have achieved higher A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 per cent of students achieved A grades in Medellin, while 72 per cent of German learners, 69 per cent of French learners and 63 per cent of Spanish learners also achieved A grades.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will need in the future.
Languages are being taken up as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as subject choices.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of respondents attributed language skills deficiencies to the reasons given for struggling to fill vacancies by employers.
Therefore, language skills are essential to prepare most young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world with more potential employment opportunities for languages.
Whether one chooses a career or one has learned another language, one will have a real benefit of acquiring such life skills.
Being able to communicate directly abroad will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
A survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013 found that 75 percent were unable to communicate adequately in speaking a foreign language, and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Multiple languages will equip children, especially from developing economies, with the right opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, foreign schools will vary in the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that will be considered most important for the UK going forward by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, with educators who are experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are renowned for providing learning opportunities that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future may be.
In the age of global trade, there is no denying that it is very important for the future of the country and that is why it is reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as truly 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer opportunities of interest, diversity and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
This must happen.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron Sunday in St. Diego to start the Lakers
The wait for fans to see LeBron James is almost over, making his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But how many minutes he will play remains to be decided.
That would be more than one and less than 48, Walton said on Lake's official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for limited minutes.
James was asked about his plans for the Lakers after training earlier this week following a six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need Presence Games to prepare me at this stage of my career", he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of campaign rallies starting tonight in Wyling, West Virginia.
Next week was the first of five scheduled rallies by Trump that underlie the suspension in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to voting to support the decision to fill the Supreme Court vacancies, Trump is targeting support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
What is the time of Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia train ride live streamed on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the Supreme Court's retrospective Brett Kavanaugh trial this week, which has been fraught with sexual misconduct allegations for a week by the FBI's probe of the highly anticipated Senate confirmation vote.
But the main purpose behind the rallies is to help Republicans cope with the November elections.
So, President Trump's campaign is aiming to activate volunteers and supporters at five rallies over the next week, as Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives try to protect and expand the presidency, according to Reuters.
A Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Congress control was so important to his agenda that the president would travel to as many states as possible because we are in a busy campaign period.
According to West Virginia Metro News, with plans for the Westbank Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and receive coverage from Pittsburgh media.
It will be the second time in the past month that Trump visited West Virginia on Saturday, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump attempts to assist West Virginia Republican Senate Rep. Patrick Morris, who is behind in the nomination.
According to Reuters, Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said it was not a good sign for Morris that he had to try to advance in the presidential election.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows will to hope to stay alive in Sunday's single
After three one-sided sessions it was down to just four sets on a Saturday afternoon, which was probably what this Ryder Cup required.
The pendulum swinging in motion is a complete inventive sporting concept, but one that the athlete actually believes and then never gets into competitions like this.
So it's going to say where is the momentum now?
Because it's been going around all day, Jordan Spieth said, "They had a six-figure increase and now it's down to four, so we're giving it a little bit of a boost".
Europe has certainly gained four points with twelve more points in the game.
Like Spieth says, Americans think the air is a little bit pro-American and have a lot of people to cheer for, not like Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together all day and each get three out of four.
Spieth went from T to Green and is ahead with an example.
The festive shouts began to catch up as his round was running, while A and Thomas were both down to the after, with a crucial boot sinking to take the match to the four all-square.
The guy who won them the 15th game was met with the same screams that show you that the American team is not out of this.
"You really just dug deep and worried about your match", said Speeth.
All those players have left it now.
18 holes to mark.
The only players with extra points over the last two days by Spithead and Thomas are Fansesco Molinari and Tommy Flatwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's oddly adorable couple is four by four and can't make a mistake.
The only couple who did not fight on Saturday afternoon, but instead stopped fighting on Saturday morning, Friday after nine o'clock.
The run and the way their energy flows on both sides of the bustling crowd, it seems, are the players who will lose on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player for a potential European win, so Lee suns down to Fleetwood or Molinari than the Golf National.
Especially the two are together on different halls.
But the European pride is ahead of its time.
When he was joined by Alex Noren, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played the small part of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning show.
A spaniard and a swede swings two doubles on a bogey and a front nine into a hole, in which he will never come close to climbing.
However, there is no one to help you out of the hall on Sunday.
It is fascinating to look closely at the Forbells and the Forum, because the dialogue between the two is so close that they don't take the advice that they give and thus the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has performed better as a team, so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day, but the Forum session shows that Team USA is willing to fight, which was signalling some particular stats.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
After Saturday's four-ball exit and a 10-6 lead over the United States, Europe will take full advantage of the Ryder Cup final day in four matches.
The inspired duo of Yomi Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two wins over Tiger Woods, who has struggled to take four points so far in Le Tigre National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side want to save the trophy they lost a year ago in Hazelton and dominate the American team in the morning football, taking the series 3-1.
The Americans put up more resistance in the forums, winning two matches but they could not work in a loss.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European player to have four points saved in a match, while he and Molinari dubbed "Mollywood", after a great weekend, only the second pair to have four points saved in their opening match in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reid in the foreball, he went on to beat Woods and American player Bryson Deschamboux by a further strong 5&4.
Woods, who had shown himself in two matches on Saturday, showed a powerful burst of intelligence, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes.
Justin Rose rested for the foreballs in the morning. Dustin Johnson and Brooks returned to Coepac's 2&1 defeat to teammate Henrik Stenson - ranked first and third in the world.
This was not the case in Europe on a pleasant, humorous day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
He scored a spectacular 2&1 victory over Spain's Joan Rahm and Ian Poulter in the foreballs and then struck them in return, beating Poul and Rory Merroy 4&3, losing two holes early in the foreballs.
Only two teams in Ryder Cup history have lost in a single four-point loss to strike back, but as holders, Furyk's side needed only to pull to retain the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, yet striking back on Sunday, it seems like this will be over.
North Korea says it will unilaterally disarm without trust, there is no way.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions on the United States deepened his distrust, and there was no way the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Meeting of the World Nuclear Association that North Korea took significant good faith measures last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, demolishing a nuclear test site, and promising to not proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we did not get any response from the US, he said.
Without any trust in America, there will be no trust in our national security, and there is no way in which we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Ri reiterated Washington's resistance to North Korean complaints about a "committed" approach to denuclearization, it felt that the statement was appropriate because North Korea would gradually make the right decisions and be rewarded, while not directly denying unilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
While Kim vowed to work towards the "decentralization of the Korean Peninsula", Ri published a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on June 12 in Singapore, the first ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, and Trump pledged to protect North Korea.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US says Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insisted on "disarmament first" and increased the level of sanctions and pressure to achieve its objectives in a restrictive manner, even to the point of declaring the end of the war.
The assumption that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the reality is that constant sanctions only deepen our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had mentioned earlier in the week at the UN.
The Minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in five months and said: "The party to this denuclearization problem is South Korea, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have happened at such a rapid pace".
Even when he spoke to the UN, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from the one he had the previous year. The general assembly was essential after Trump referred to Kim as "Mr. Evil President", a "rocket man" who is on a suicide mission, who keeps the U.S. mainland on the target of North Korean rockets.
Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said much more work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit, "If it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking action.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must be enforced rigorously and without fail until we have full, final, certified assurance that nuclear weapons have been destroyed".
The Security Council unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea from 2006 to bid to raise funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that the progress North Korea had made in hours had only been blamed on "criminal-like" figures.
This month, North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States "takes similar action".
He said Kim had told him that the "similar steps" he wanted were moves to move toward improving security and relations with Washington, as Trump had promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are racing to get a break
This year, a new course at Harvard University has graduated more than the growing macho culture being studied by caffeine-fueled "all-nighters".
When it came to how to take care of themselves, the students of the world's top universities saw an academic without a trajectory.
Charles Kizzler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the framework for the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
She was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And then a girl came up to me and said, "Now, my senior year, why am I the only one being told this?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, she told the Telegraph.
The course, which was implemented for the first time this year, teaches students how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance and enhance their general well-being.
Paul Brera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to start the course after students were deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive activities.
One section features a picture of a room in the student residence, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of bedtime.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the complex with an interactive icon, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes for smoking, Professor Kassler added.
He said that the culture of 'pulling all-nighters' pride still exists, he said that modern technologies and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough good quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to deal with stress, fatigue, and anxiety - even for weight loss, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, which causes them to feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, took one of his classes during his first year at Harvard and helped Professor Kizzler design the course.
She said that this course opened her eyes and inspired her for a campus-wide course.
As a next step, they expect that all these postgraduate students will be asked to complete the same course of study before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Kessler recommended that students should be aware of when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting systems, which can lead to sleep problems that disrupt your circadian rhythm.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mangala kicks off the goal with Gerald's men
Rangers faced another battle of the distant blues as a disgruntled side as Dolly Mangan's Strike lost 1-0 at Steven Gerrard's Livingston.
Ebrooks wanted to record his first win on the road since St. John's won 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team left Gerard with a second loss as manager of 18 games.
Manga struck seven minutes before half-time and did not even have the motivation to balance the rangers.
The Rangers finished in sixth place, while Livingston climbed to third and behind Hibermian on goal distance.
Apparently throwing an item from a distance can cause more trouble for rangers in the store after the lineman spends hours being moved under treatment for a head injury.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side, which made the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup last year.
On the other hand, Holt is happy to go with the Levi-11, who took a point from Hurts last week and has been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit has taken the breath away of his opponents at every stage.
The Rangers may have dominated but Livingston did a lot with the ball he had.
They only needed two minutes when Mangala's first-ever late-off sent Scott Pittman through with a goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
A deep knee capped Jacob after a free-kick to Captain Craig Hulk but his defensive partner Allen Lithgow could only extend into the back post.
Rangers took control but looked more hopeful than convinced about their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been penalised at fifteen minutes because he and Steven Laureas had collided but the referee Steven Thomson denied the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers used only two first half shots at the target, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassa's header of Kulibli and a weakened Owe Azria strike.
While Levy's 34th-minute opener might have been against the run of the game, no one could deny that he was on his own for his own good.
Again, the Rangers failed to work with the deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Airfield did not respond as Deacon Gallagher hit the ball at Scott Robinson, who maintained his composure to pick up Manga for an easy finish.
Gerard turned the work on the brakes as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the winger's slot in the switch morelos provided almost immediate impact but the imposing Kelly was blocked from his line.
But Livingstone continued to play as he pleased, hitting the long ball high with a leathergown and helmet to keep the visitors in check.
Holt's side increased their lead in the final stages, but before Lithgow came from the corner, McGregor was well positioned to block Jacob.
The Rangers were sued for a penalty in lieu of Glenn Middleton because he had been messing with Jacobs but again saw Thomas off.
Panchang: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... that day when the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become a mainstay of science, counter-pop culture, as well as the 1950 film The Bells of Cornado starring the seemingly unlikely gypsies Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What in the world?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear earphones, you can actually hear the effects that minerals have on radioactivity.
Evans: "Say, it's definitely popping up!" "I'm not sure what to do with it.
Hans Giger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is alive.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'see' bad cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells.
The method involves extracting the patient's immune cells, converting them into a laboratory.
Then they can look at the normal proteins for many cancers and then are injected again
A trial vaccine has shown promising results in many cancer patients.
A woman treated by a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells found that her cervical cancer was cured in 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, turning them over to the lab so they can look at a protein common in many cancers, known as HER2, and then re-inserting the cells.
Professor J. Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "increases the development of many types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers", explained Prof. Bernzowski.
His approach of teaching how to extract immune cells from patients and target cancer cells has worked in a form of treatment for leukemia.
New West hit on a pro-Trump diet after wearing a mega hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West's hurray was called into the studio after a thrilling performance during Saturday Night Live praising his U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great hat, he continued to fight against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
Often I talk to an American person and they say: "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left America a long time ago".
SNL opened the show with a skit by Matt Damon that satirized Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual harassment by Hollywood star Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's rent by comedian Chris Rock was uploaded to social media.
It is unclear whether or not the rock was trying to make a joke of West with the posting.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had an unfavorable time wearing his headgear.
They threatened me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They harassed me!
According to the Washington Examiner he said, "and then he says I'm in a sunken place".
West went on: "You want to see the sunken place?" He said, "I'll wear my Superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?"
"I have been a disciple of Jesus Christ for many years.
Her comments received at least two roars from listeners and members of the SLN were disappointed, Variety reported, with one person telling the publication there: "There was a sharp sonata in the entire studio".
West was brought in to replace vocalist Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Loved It dressed as a perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the head of the TPUSA group who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: thank you for standing up in the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "who she is and she's absolutely amazing".
But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing an ideology and speaking that is harmful to my community.
It is independent.
So we are", she added.
Before the show, stating that he is now known as Kanye West, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and it was certainly a musical legend that Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist already known as Prince.
The next day, I was arrested and charged with murder.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after killing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balliamakur, police said.
He is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kate Harrington is beaten to death by a toxic man.
Kit Harrington is famous for his swordplaying role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has struck down the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such roles on screen mean that young people feel they must be strong to earn respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he believes 'something has gone wrong' and raised the question of how to overcome the toxic disease problem in the #MeToo era.
As for Kate, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, she admitted that she felt too strongly to address the issue.
I feel very strongly at this moment personally - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?'
What are we teaching men as they grow up about the problem we want?
Kitt believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What is birth and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on TV and in the streets, that makes young boys think that this is the exact part of being a man that he should be?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because something is clearly wrong with the young men.'
He admitted in interviews that he was "tired of battlefields and horses" and that he might not be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when it comes out late next summer.
November will play the lead in Sam Shepard's return to True West from Kit, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who are robbers.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my future family and my life here.'
Rose played Yigret in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Kit's character Jon Snow's love affair.
The couple married in June 2018 at the location of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/ AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018, almost 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases that marked the change from the past were transmitted by sex.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in large parts of China as a result of infectious blood transmission.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said the number of new HIV infections has been reduced to almost zero.
Year-on-year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discouraged in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be severe.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the spread of diseases are due to insufficient sexual safety in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promoted the conservative use of HIV drugs as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee leaked GOP Senator data, blasting 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the members' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insists that the claims were manipulated by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, and more hateful lies, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The transmitted information included home addresses and phone numbers for the U.S. Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of Utah.
This information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh appeared online Thursday.
The leaks came after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pandit and Redstat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the voter's office and published information about a member of the voter staff, Hill said.
These baseless accusations are completely untrue and a complete lie, Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
These baseless allegations are completely false and a complete lie.
Waters' statement immediately sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This rejection is in anger", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that she is unlikely to become a member of Congress.
They do not become angry when someone is accused of something they have not done.
They should not be bad.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They must be quiet and gentle".
Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to Jeter Kavanaugh's criticism of Democrats, who were accused by angry critics during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Nauro also took to Twitter to express his thoughts on rallying voters in the midterm elections.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office has "alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims".
We will ensure that the culprits are exposed, and "that they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to me and any members of the staff".
The English Strikes Again review by John Rowan Atkinson looked down on the Spy Spoof.
It is now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new film with British slant and it applies to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Should we be embarrassed by the fact that we are the new export opportunities of the country?
At any rate, the front-facing, rubber-faced John English has a license to remake anything - even if his name suggests more than anything that he is a broad comic creation designed for a non-English-cinematic field.
He is certainly a skilled secret agent who, despite his eccentric disguise, has found some clues in the riots of the fire theme tune to Mr. Bean's costume and a doll of that boy at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is based on the original pilgrim and mystery international man Atkinson who once played in a Barclaycard TV commercial leaving his trail of anarchy.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Jay outing.
Johnny English was approaching the helicopter I loved, while he was wearing the medieval suit of armour and the rotor blade was wrapped in front of his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor feels very low and oddly clichéd, especially with serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offering comedy as their own confident ingredient.
It seems that this humor is designed for young children rather than adults, and for me the futile adventures of John English are not as exploratory and focused as Atkinson's silent-film gags in Bean's persona.
Now the best domestic support is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, exposing the identities of agents across Britain, for the downfall of an agent on duty - an unfortunate minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last spark for a Prime Minister who is a tough and embracing person who is already painfully coping with political unpopularity: Emma Thompson This Quisi-Theresa-May character works very well but there is nothing special in the script to work with her.
Her secret advisers advised her that she would have to bring someone out of retirement as every active spy had settled.
This means that John's fight with English himself, who is now employed as a school-level operative in a posh establishment, but is proving off-the-records to be an undercover operative: Here are some good gauges, as English spy's rock type academy presents.
English is sent back to Whitefall for an urgent briefing and is reunited with his long-suffering former sidekick Buff, played again by Ben Miller.
Buff is a married man, bent on being a submarine commander, with a jolie-hockey-sticks role to play with Vicky Pepedin a little bit of a dud.
So Batman and Robin are back in action to get things very wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fiancee fighting off against Ofelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Karishma is falling terribly in the lap of a tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: Papi Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bogg embark on their odyssey of farcical high jinks, assuming the disguise of a servant, they set fire to the Flash Game Restaurant; they smuggle in by riding on Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure chaos as he attempts a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the obstacles have been taken back for that final sequence, but as it is amusing and entertaining, there is very little children's TV about the whole thing.
Pretty middle stuff.
And as with other Johnnie English films, I can't help but wonder: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Worker rejects, he plans to work a four-day week for Britons but gets paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan in which Britons will work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings made possible by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to employees to give them more days off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking home the same pay.
Sources said that this idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has endorsed a four-day week to take advantage of the economy of shifting workers.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be released before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits with the approach of the party to rebalance the economy in favour of the workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.'
The Green Party supported a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign, while the Labour Party would not be the first party to support the idea.
However, this desire is not currently supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a labor conference last week to dismiss his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get power back from the 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' in utility companies.
Shareholders in water companies will not be able to recover their full shares as the Labour government could 'take a cut' based on alleged misstatements.
He has also supported plans to put employees on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to allow employees to hold 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies, which stand to be paid out of an annual dividend of up to £500.
Linde Graham, John Kennedy, talks for 60 minutes about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh may change their minds
An FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could force any Republican senators to support the nomination.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Paley asked Republicans Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, could the FBI find anything that would motivate him to change his mind?
Kennedy looked more free-spirited than his colleague from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course".
I said, I went to the hearing and said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After that, I called him, he dropped the charges, he said, 'Did you do that?'
He was resolute, determined and unparalleled.
Graham's meaning, however, seems to be set in stone.
My brain is about Brett Kavanagh and he's going to charge dynamite, he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one could prove what she called it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any new behavior.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will host the New York Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive line-up of artists and an equally impressive goal; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will draw thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the feats of Majon Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the concert's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, called in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that actively seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight against it.
To receive free tickets to the concert (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), musicians had to complete a series of tasks, such as emailing a world leader, calling or other meaningful means of helping to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free music program a real way to persuade people to call for action, or just another case of so-called "clictivism" - people believing that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet, they are doing the right thing?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has logged more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which emphasize a variety of goals.
It says these actions have inspired world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in pledges and policies to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been distributed or funded.
The group estimates that Safe Fund has so far directly impacted approximately 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers, is committed to "helping children grow to their full potential" in some of the key pledges pledging $35 million in aid to end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets by global citizens.
At a live music concert in London in April 2018, Tracey Ulman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the assembled crowd, "With your support from the UK government, as well as from donors, national governments and global citizens, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history".
The group also stated that after more than 5000 steps were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children across the UK, the government announced funding for a project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children suffering from malnutrition.
In response to an FAQ on its website, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are among the acts featured at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy could use blockade to disrupt Russian energy supply - Home Secretary
Washington could use its navy if necessary to prevent a clash in Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East.
Zink alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is running at the invitation of the Syrian government - is a pretense of seeking new energy markets.
They want the power of the middle as they do in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and I think that's why they're in the Middle East.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States has the capacity of our navy, and if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that its energy does not go to market, the sea is open", he said.
Zink was addressing the attendees at the ceremony organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization and whose identity in the US is that of "the voice of the energy consumer".
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and noted that they were almost identical.
He described Russia as a "monkey-riding" economy based on crude oil, and said that "the economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to take a lesser advantage and fuel alternative.
The statements come as the Trump administration is focused on exporting its cheap liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European customers instead of Russia.
To make matters worse, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have tried to pull Germany out of the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Russia has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Russia argues that the US's strong opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we agree that energy can never be a tool to use pressure and that consumers have the right to choose suppliers".
Germany is not deterred by the US stance and has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading association for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from the European energy policy as well as the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Campe, said that he was concerned that a third country was interfering with our energy supply.
Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren will take a "tough stance" in running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she will take a "tough stance" in running for President after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts that he would host the Running for President.
According to The Hill newspaper, it's time for women to invade Washington and fix our broken government, and it's women at the top.
After November 6, I will take a hard stance in running for President.
During the Warren Town Hall, the president railed on Donald Trump and said that he was "taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am ashamed of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have openly criticized the war.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We had to check with the FBI before voting".
However, a poll released Thursday found that most of Warren's candidates do not think Warren should be running for president in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not have taken the step, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the move.
The poll found support for Runn with 38 percent supporting and 48 percent opposing former Governor Deval Patrick, who had been the most supportive in the poll.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have come up in the discussion in reference to a possible 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Palin's PTSD on the tracks of the Donald Trump rally
Treacy Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq in the military in September.
He was arrested on a domestic violence case on Monday night.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sarah told the audience about Donald, "I can understand the situation my own son is going through, what he's going through after he's returned, the pain of the families of soldiers who suffered the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounded who came back".
Palin described her arrest as the "elephant in the room" and said of her son and other returning veterans, "Those who have come back have changed, they are coming back numb, they are amazed to see what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military is giving the country in return for what they gave the country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, on Monday his wife was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence for assaulting a woman and interfering with a domestic violence case as well as for possession of weapons while intoxicated.
DCs of 18 States support challenge against new Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia back a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies victims of gang or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-court on Friday in Washington to support shelter calves challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name is Grace V. Sessions, whose suit against the federal policy was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union, has not been released.
She was chased by her partner and his violent gang-member sons, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace wrote to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which led to a surge in applicants for U.S. asylum, as the country faces widespread problems of gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Police Board reversed the Board of Immigrant Appeals' 2014 decision allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum from domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney General Carl Ressen said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades-old state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims are decided subject to certain facts and circumstances and such a statute violates that principle, the Fend-of-Court said in a statement.
Attorneys further argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry would "shock the U.S. economy, which was working to become entrepreneurial and provide the "essential labor supply".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11, saying that asylum is available for people who leave their home country because of fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum did not mean to eliminate all the problems, all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll in Palu doubled, rescue efforts to find survivors intensified.
The situation was even more dire for the survivors.
Comforting her child in a evacuation centre in the city of Palu, 35 year old mother Risa Kusuma said, "There is a lot of tension.
Every minute an ambulance brings a corpse.
There is a lack of clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, picking up things that had fallen in the water and trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds injured and in the middle of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, hospitals were in a state of shock.
One of the injured, Dwayne Harris, suffered a broken back and shoulder and was resting outside the Army Hospital in Palo, as patients were treated there for frequent strong aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he recalled the moments he had spent with his wife and daughter in the fifth floor of the hotel, which was shaken by the earthquake.
There was no time to defend ourselves.
Harris, who was in town for a family wedding, told the Associated Press that he felt as if he had been crushed under the rubble of the hotel.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then the voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' with 'propaganda aids'
A four-page advertisement in a state-run Chinese newspaper in the US cited the mutual benefits of US-China trade, a week after the US ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the supplement to an ad in the Des Moines Register - the state's largest selling newspaper - China Daily - accusing China of interfering in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, which China has dismissed.
Trump has accused China of trying to interfere in U.S. elections, U.S. officials told Reuters, adding that a new phase of intensifying the U.S. campaign to pressure China has begun.
It is common for foreign governments to resort to advertising to promote trade, but China and the US have recently been embroiled in a trade war, and both have imposed new tariffs on each other's imports.
China's reactionary tariff laws were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa at the start of the trade war, and Iowa supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, a longtime governor of China's top agricultural exporter, said China has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Opinion paper Des Moines Register on Sunday that "China is now scaring us twice as much by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
Branstad wrote that "the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's glorious tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of expression to print a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda".
He writes that "in contrast, in the Chinese newspaper world you will hear limited anti-Chinese rhetoric and you will not see a true reflection of the disagreement of the Chinese people on China's economic flow, because the media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party".
He added, "A leading Chinese newspaper turned down an offer to publish his article, though he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts warn that defending Cavanaugh is upsetting Republican women voters ahead of the midterm elections
While Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stands with and defends him in the case of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warned that the party will face resentment, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the subject have been extremely heavy, and most Republicans are already saying they want to move forward with the referendum.
Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill that there is no going back.
I don't believe that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI will be able to attract angry voters, said Rehr.
Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group Mouvement, told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday that "women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow and they won't forget in November".
"November is coming!" the protesters said on Friday morning as they protested in the hallway of the Senate saying that the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee had pushed ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site that "the Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation is soaring.
People say that enthusiasm is already there; and it's true.
But it may be that especially among female voters in smaller cities and young voters aged 18-29 years, when they don't elect the president, they don't vote often".
Before detailing the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee in Ford's public testimony, analysts suggested that a backlash could occur if Republicans move forward with confirmation.
According to former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele of NBC News, "This has become a perplexing puzzle for the GOP.
It's not just about the committee's vote on whether to put Kavanaugh on the bench or not, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled the whole issue and the way they've handled the plaintiff, Guy Cecil, director of Group Priorities USA, which elects Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the American people may be somewhat divided by what goes further towards the Fords and Kavanagh Accords.
A new poll of the National Academy of Sciences found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony was definitely or perhaps true, while 35 percent said they were definitely with Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, following pressure from Flake.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk at age 17.
Ramirez has alleged that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her to him at a party in the 1980s while studying at Yale.
The inventors of the World Wide Web, for Google and Facebook, are planning to launch a new Internet
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inerpt, the latest project of Technology Legend, is a company that is building the open source platform of Berners-Lee solidly.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which information to allow access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind the Intrapt is "world domination".
We have to do it now, he said about startups.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store", or POD.
This may include a contact list, to-do list, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional resources.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify and is available everywhere on the same browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide what type of information he wants to give access to.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inerpt is to provide the company with the resources, process and the right expertise to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has several staff developers and volunteer coders from Bruce, the security platform acquired by IBM by Burns-Lee, contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the InReput website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes to "where all their business models stand overnight".
We don't need their permission for that.
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "goal is to provide the professional energy and ecosystem to help secure the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
In 1994, Burns-Lee revolutionized the Internet when the World Wide Web Consortium was established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
After the launch of Inert, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Web, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Celebration of the WW1 Victoria Cross cleric
The only Church of England cleric to have won the Victoria Cross in the First World War and its 100 years has been celebrated in the city.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award in the attack on Belenglish and Lehcourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and it was not known then that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial was unveiled by two of his grandsons in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "brilliant symbol", heralding his grandfather's award-winning feat of the monument would be nearly 100 years old.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Wayne led his battalion towards Canal de Saint-Quentin amid "excessive fog and heavy fire from field and machine guns".
He later reached the firing line and with "great bravery" advanced alone with the field-gun and escaped in a troop of three.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a month before the war ended.
Michael Wan, 72, said that the work his grandfather did "was something I knew I could never do but it makes me humble to something".
He and his brother Dr. James Wan also laid wreaths after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wan said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the support given by many people is showing the bravery of a true hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Ballet 206, instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stayed up all night to watch Pac-Ball 206 to avoid watching the main event.
San Jose's bill includes 13 fights, including six on the main card and being shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, viewers in the UK were appalled when Gagard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other and instead the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were up until early in the morning for a special fight, not knowing it was going to happen.
One fan on Twitter called the children's cartoon a "sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications, said, "The government rule is that the content was not appropriate for 6 p.m. so they had to go on kids programming.
I was a little bit nervous about the whole thing.
Scott Cocker, chairman of the Bellator company, said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
I think when I think about replays, I think we can probably do it", Coker said.
But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning and we cannot do it this way.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when there is a switchover, many scripts go back and forth and it didn't all look smooth.
We tried to fix it and we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I promise you that it will not happen again.
We'll keep it five fights instead of six as we normally do and we tried to deliver more for the fans and we went over the top.
It's called a bad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has experienced a 'numb' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he used to look down on everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
Daly, 24, said it wasn't until he went to a secondary school that he realized "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on First Radio 4's Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke about gay rights to people about "getting hope".
He also said that being a parent is less about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter on the long-running show, has been ill for several months.
Appearing as Castaway on Laverne's first program, Daly said that she felt she was "lacking more than anyone" because "it's not socially acceptable to pick boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those who have experienced feelings of inferiority and feelings of being different from others have actually given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", so he didn't disappoint anyone when he found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to call for more countries to abolish homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to have lived without solutions and he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said she fell in love with U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom she "suddenly caught me" in a 2013 interview.
Daley married last year's Oscar winner, who is 20 years her senior, but she said the age gap was never an issue.
When you go through so many good-luck moments at such a young age - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer. He said it is difficult to find a Hummer who has had similar good-luck experiences.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said it changed the "whole perspective" of their lives.
If you had asked me last year, 'I want to win a gold medal' that was all.
You know what is bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son is named after the same person as his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011.
Daly said that his father had not accepted the death and finally said that he still wanted to sit in the front row if he had tickets for London 2012.
I could not tell him that you cannot sit in the queue wearing the sari, he said.
His breathing slowed and he really stopped breathing until I was sitting holding his hand. Dad died and I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible, he said.
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I realized that this was my life's dream - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games is not a special feeling.

Out of shape for Michelson sat on a Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson is going to play in the biennial event for a record 12th time, he was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and forums.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has done repeatedly for the United States, instead of being in the middle of the main action five times, this five-time grand champion has divided his day between being among them as a cheerleader and focusing on his game.
Not even at the peak of his career when fairly straight drivers are not tight the 48-year-old is not ideally suited for the National Golf Course, where long rough grounds regularly punish wrong shots.
And if the course itself isn't as tough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has paired with Toki Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans are down four points in 12 singles matches, Michelsen's match could prove to be decisive enough to end the competition before it even begins.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, but he had nothing else to say.
"He understood his role well today, he patted me on the back, wrapped his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and has put a lot of his life into this team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine that he would play two matches.
I had imagined more, but we thought that we had to go as far as we could.
He wants to be there like everyone else".
Michelson will break Nick Faldo's record with Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the height of his personal record.
Although Michaels has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves at the club, Furyke said his presence has instilled some uncanny power into the team.
He is funny, he is sarcastic, he is witty, he likes to make fun of people and he is a great person to be in the team room with, he explained.
I think the youngest players can have fun with it, it was fun to watch this week.
He has a lot more to offer than just playing".
Captain Thomas Bjorne of Europe knows that a big lead will be unlocked at any time.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a hefty lead down to the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an upset.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valledrama, in which the side was given a five-point advantage over the Americans by captain Seve Ballesteros, but narrowly escaped the nose by 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valledrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valledrama we won, even if only when, Bjorn said, looking back at the class of 2018, both won 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and our team that time is not running out.
You will be quite bored tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It is not over until the points are on the board.
Our goal is to try and win this trophy and that is the focus.
I have told everyone that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but on the other hand there are the world's great players that we know well".
Bjorn says it is thrilling to see the way his players have performed on the Tuff golf course, adding: "I never put myself ahead of this.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
Tomorrow will be a personal performance and that is a different thing to do.
When things are going well with a partner, it's great, but when you have to show off in person, your ability as a golfer is put to the test.
The only message you need to get to the players is that you have to give your best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and give him your best and at your own expense".
Against Bjorn, rival Jim Furyk would expect a better performance individually than his partner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four points, would have expected from the rest of the players.
Furyk himself has tasted both loss and win, having played for Europe's "Miracle at Medina" and being part of the winning Brooklyn team before coming out as the loser.
In 1999, when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had treated his players on the last day, he replied, "I remember every word".
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you have to start fast like you saw in Medina, like you saw in Brooklyn.
When momentum is going in one direction, a lot of pressure builds up in the middle of matches.
We have to set our line-up accordingly and put the players in a design that we feel we can show some magic tomorrow".
Thompson is tasked with stepping up the game and facing Rory McIlroy in the top half of the match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter facing other Europeans in the top half order.
Bjorne of the Selection of Singles said, "I went into this group in order because I think it covers everything".
The new German battleship was again suspended.
The newest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be launched in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era Kalin-class battleships, but due to faulty systems and high costs, it could not be launched until next year, local media reported.
A military spokesman said that the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates branded "Rheinland-Pfalz" has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The vessel was to be commissioned in 2014, but a controversial post-delivery issue derailed the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to have a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important characteristics include its long maintenance period - new frigates should be able to be laid up for two years from home ports.
However, persistent delays mean that cutting-edge warships that are supposed to be able to show off Germany's power abroad will be outdated by the time they enter service, DieselZight notes.
The crippled F-125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to sanction the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy sent back a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was said about the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media mentioned some important "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the battleship useless on a combat mission.
The software flaws were especially significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class battleships would be manned by a sailor crew of 120, a manpower only half that of the manpower on the older Bremen class frigates.
Furthermore, it has also been revealed that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Palatinate" is thought to be as heavy as the Age class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project including the training of the crew is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the initial cost of the project has increased from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The issue of new frigates is of particular importance in light of recent warnings that the German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was actually "going through a deployment-capable ship shortage".
The officer said that the issue was heating up over time as the old ships were scrapped but no vessels were delivered.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
National Trust Events on the Secret Life of Bats
New research being carried out on real estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to explore how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will include common and soprano pipistrels in the Inverve gardens of Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared and dowbenton bats.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's sound and what species is doing.
A habitat map and report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dever, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to the bat and how they are used by each species.
This information will help in better determining the benefits such as grassland creation and how best to conserve woodlands for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by building and development works that damage their routes and habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, some chemical treatment of flypapers and building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a modern eco-location technique to point out errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks of the country and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect resting places and occasionally conduct rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve area at Thrive Estate in Drumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal field for him.
Here at Threeway, we have developed a nice area for bats, he said.
We have found old buildings, many old trees and very good habitats.
But there's still a lot about that bat that is still unknown, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us understand more about how to move forward".
He stressed the importance of bat testing before undertaking maintenance on the property as the possible unintended destruction of a single litter of bats could lead to the extinction of 400 females and juveniles, possibly the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their roost.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged people to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and their many species, we don't even know how their populations are growing".
Ronaldo denied the rape allegations as lawyers sued the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape claims against him "fake news", with Ronaldo saying people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, accusing the magazine of being a fraud.
In 2009, in a Las Vegas hotel room, Portugal and Juventus forward Ronaldo is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga.
He is alleged to have paid $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, addressed 14.2 million of his fans in an Instagram live video, calling the reports "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I was just saying that.
Everything they print today is fake news", said five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo on camera.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
And that is normal.
They want to get my name in print and become famous, but this is part of the business.
I'm happy and everyone is fine", Ronaldo said with a smile.
Lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, according to the news agency Reuters, calling the report "unfair reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schartz said the player would seek compensation for damage to the moral image commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to papers filed in Clark County District Court of Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by committing an act against nature.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and only "one percent" a "bad guy".
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared a reprisal" and "worried about being publicly humiliated".
Mayorga, 34, says she now wants to cancel the settlement because she has been constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse, and moved to Italian giants Juve this summer in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will 'always regret' losing its status as a carmaker
If the UK loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, it will "always regret it", said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "of importance" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Barnston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
Mr. Clarke said, "We need a deal.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnstone plant, which makes Toyota's Oris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production cease at our factory, said Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota of Barnston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about the threat of leaving the EU, saying that leaving the EU without a deal would affect how cross-border businesses including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover will operate.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, carmakers say supply chain risk is a major concern.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis for car orders coming from both the UK and the EU, with parts coming in every 37 minutes from suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border and, as industry has said, a shortage of parts and delays.
The company said that it is not possible to keep more than one day's worth of inventory of Toyota at its Derbyshire plant, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "specifically designed to avoid checks at the border".
He told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "We need a deal. We want to do the best deal, to seize this opportunity with success in the present.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers says that we need to be fully capable of continuing the highly successful chain of supply.
He could not say how long Toyota would be shut down but warned that the extra costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Sowelris, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is a United Union conveyor at the plant, said his members' concerns were growing: "My experience is that once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a definite and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be "postponed for an additional week" as the Supreme Court continues to debate the nomination of Breitbart, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump supporters and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and whether that will jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has been a rumour on the streets of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had worn wires to record conversations with Trump and discussed the possibility of removing the president by the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, reportedly, to resign.
Instead of meeting with Trump, it was announced Thursday who would be at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't like" firing Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was held in which testimony was taken from both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who alleged sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, with further delays in the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date is not set, it could be this week, I think everything is focused on the Supreme Court and it will be delayed for another week.
We'll see though and I always like to keep the press informed".
Some reporters objected to the fact that Sanders had not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Anchor Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders said the reason for not doing the briefings was not to "offend" TV reporters, adding that "I don't disagree with the fact that they are offended".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
She said that the current president has had more question and answer sessions than any previous president. She added without giving evidence: "We know the numbers".
Sanders said the briefing would still take place, but that "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question directly to the president of the United States, it is far better to speak to him than to me".
We try to do that and we've done a lot of that in the last few weeks, and you can talk to the president of the United States when the press briefing is held".
Trump routinely answers journalists' questions while walking out of the White House or attending open sessions or attending press conferences with visitors.
However, a press conference alone is rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have said why journalists assumed a strange situation and acted recklessly before the gathering.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff to express the country's gratitude to the staff working in Scotland's NHS and wish them to stay after Brexit.
The Freeman MSP of GA sent the letter less than six months after the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the costs of applying for permanent status for EU nationals working in its dedicated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU to leave were underway and were moving towards the expected decision by this autumn.
But the UK government is also moving ahead in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very anxious time for all of us.
So I would like to reiterate that I value the contributions of every member of staff, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union have contributed their valuable experience and expertise and this has strengthened the work of the health service and benefited the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here".
Kristen Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after severe head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christan Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a severe head injury during a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, as reported by Tennessee's Mike Organs.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
It slid to one side and just dropped there, Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen before placing him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the surgery was performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Abercrombie.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type or extent of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
This is his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois to redshirt sophomore Abercrombie.
He had five tackles on Saturday before being taken out of the game, with his total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay high stamp duty when buying property in UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty to buy property in the UK using the extra cash to help the homeless with extra cash under the new Tory Plan.
This move could undermine the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters.
Stamp duty will be increased on people who do not pay tax in UK
The Treasury expects to be able to raise up to £120 million a year in this way to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay high stamp duty when buying property in the UK, with extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's drive to target younger voters for more affordable housing and high earners.
To boost the government's drive to raise money to tackle Rough Sleeping, an increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies not paying taxes in the UK.
Surcharges - which are in addition to the current stamp duty, which can include the high level introduced on selling a second home and purchasing two years ago and can be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to take home the house.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" as there are large numbers of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
Boris Johnson has announced a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused the big construction companies of squatting on the land to keep property prices high, and Theresa May urged Britain to drop quotas on cheap housing to fix the "housing digression".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a groundbreaking series of proposed housing reforms including rent controls and "no-fault" eviction of occupations.
He wants to give the committee more power to build new houses.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means we fix the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is hardly fair that it is as easy for a hard-working UK resident to buy a house as it is for individuals who do not live in the UK and work for overseas-based companies.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become a rarity and sleeping in a rented house is becoming a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My last wish is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is taking up the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, with a top three point.
He disappeared from the stadium this summer after guiding St Mirren back to last season's Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But I grew up as a kid watching Scotland play in Hampden with my dad, and that always pulls me back.
That opportunity will come only if I succeed in club management".
Ross' predecessors as the manager of Sutherland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kean, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Aloha Athletic boss says he finds no discomfort in pursuing such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'If I can take this club back to the Premier League, can I succeed at this point?'
The infrastructure and facilities at this club are undoubtedly what makes it a Premier League club", he said.
It's not an easy task to get there, but if I can get the club back there, I'll see myself as a success here.
Ross is only three years into his management career, having worked 15 months as assistant boss at Dumbarton and 15 months on Hart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa regain three-tier status, and the following season St Mirren won the championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He said of Eloah, "It was probably the culmination of life.
I really believed that management was more suited to me than playing.
It feels strange because I've done well, lived a decent life out of it and enjoyed some decent motives.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to look at a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through the pressure and burden of that work but the management seems quite right.
I always wanted to manage and now that I do, it feels most comfortable for me to be on my own throughout my life".

The perfect time for a pint is Saturday at 5.30am, says the survey
The summer heatwave has boosted earnings for Britain's struggling pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and Bar Groups recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurants saw a 4.8 percent decline in revenue.
Peter Martin of Business Consultancy CGA, who compiled these figures, said: "The last month of June continued the pattern in July, with pubs up 2.8 per cent, while restaurants hit harder, due to the constant heat of the sun and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup.
The situation worsened in July after a decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant sales in June.
The drinks-based pubs and bars did excellent business as much as the restaurants had gone down in sales.
Meal-based pubs have also suffered heat losses, although they were not as severe as restaurant operators.
It meant that people just wanted to go out for drinks.
Drinks sales in operated pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food sales declined by three per cent".
Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM Paul Newman said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since late April.
The effects of weather and large social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the home.
It is not surprising that despite the ongoing struggle of the restaurant groups, the ongoing decline in sales of 4.8 per cent on an annualized basis will have a particularly bad effect on the ongoing price pressures.
The long hot summer should not be a bad time for the food industry and how much relief it will bring now that we are experiencing moderate temperatures in August, only time will tell".
The overall sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 in July, showing a slow decline in brand roll-outs.
The Coffee Pitch Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector monitors industry sales and obtains and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of 9 billion British pounds and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have private social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have private social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, the survey finds
A "fake Insta" page was exposed in a survey of 20,000 secondary school students
Fears have grown that the news is posting material about sex
20 percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have private social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapidly growing "fake Insta" page - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The fear has increased that the news is being posted with sexual content.
20 percent of students said they have a "mainstream" account to show parents while they also have a second private account.
A mother saw her 13-year-old daughter floating on a mysterious site, where the teenager begged others to "rape" her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of those having a private account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "Many teens are disturbed by finding online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Elijah Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eliad Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director on the Board of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those seeking guidance to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the last decade.
Alyth is widely respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that Scotland's athletics will benefit greatly from having him on board.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to working as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to Scotland and guide the sport".
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago today, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell how much I will recover.
He had to do the hard work but he came back completely, he learned how to walk and today he is practicing mindfulness!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Online opinion differs in breast pump advertising compared to cow mothers
The breast pump company shared an online opinion with the ad and compared the care of milk from mothers to cows.
To launch the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast bump", consumer tech company Alvi released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advertisement, in which the mother expresses her freedom to show the new pump.
Four real mothers dance on a track in a village with a herd of cows strewn across the street and sing songs: "Yes I give milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "Yes, you may not see the tail, but that's my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump it, pump it, I'm feeding his children, pump it, pump it, I'm milking my women".
However, the ad placed on the firm's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed response from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
There has been a lot of misconception about using cows to advertise this product.
They are pregnant like us, and they give birth to children, and they are filled with milk, but their children are taken away from them in the days of their birth".
Elvy breast pump fits perfectly inside the nursing bra (Elvy/mother)
Another comments: "It is a great shock to both mother and child.
But yes, why shouldn't mothers who are carrying their babies use breast pump ads?"
Another added: "This is an out-of-touch ad".
Another defends the ad, one woman admits she thought the song was "Hillarious".
I think this is a genius idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would need it.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
This is a bit of a crazy advertisement but it's what it looks like to me.
This is a genius product", he wrote.
Another one comments: "This is an entertaining advert aimed at those who pump ((frequently in their workplace or toilets) and are cow-looking moms.
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the dairy industry".
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with a smart pump tucked in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the understanding that many women who have had breast pumps say they feel like a cow.
The Elvy pump, however, is fairly silent, has no wires or tubes and fits perfectly inside a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and even go outside while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Anna Banarin commented: "The Alvi pump is a revolutionary product and it deserves a bold and aggressive launch.
By drawing parallels between expressing women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and all its challenges to light, and showcase it in a fun and engaging way, showing that this new pump brings a wonderful sense of liberation.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the product was used to catwalk a mother of two for designer Marta Jakuboski.
Hundreds of displaced children were quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although the number of detained migrant children has increased, the rate of monthly border crossings has not changed, as the harsh punishments and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and they fear for their own ability to stay in the country by going ahead to claim the children.
In June federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration officials, with this announcement increasing the risk.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, confessed before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor numerous citizens.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
About 80 percent of sponsors or household members are residing in the country illegally, and most of them have criminal connections.
So we continue to follow the footsteps of those individuals", said Albens.
To process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, which was previously 60 days, according to shelter workers.
Many immigration judges will meet via video conference call instead of in person, to request their case for legal status.
Those deemed ineligible for relief will be expeditiously disposed of.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can eventually lead to violent clashes or escape attempts, according to reports emerging from shelter workers and the system in recent months.
Lawyers said concerns have been raised in a large facility like Tornillo, where the number of children is more likely to be neglected.
They added that moving to a tent city without giving the children enough time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends can shock many who are already struggling.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish to withdraw 'occupying forces' immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maoum said that the Syrian refugees should also return to their homes, despite the country's eight-year-long war.
Mauleim, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops have illegally occupied Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be brought to justice".
He must go back immediately and without any conditions, he told the Assembly.
Mauleem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
Damascus will continue to fight this crusade until we have cleared all areas of Syria of both terrorist organizations and any illegal foreign presence, he said.
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moallem said that conditions were good for them to return, and he accused some Western countries of "spreading terror across the Atlantic" that forced refugees to stay away.
We have called upon the international community and humanitarian agencies to facilitate the return of these", he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely human problem.
The United Nations and the European Union have warned that reconstruction assistance for Syria will not be provided until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in one of the last strongholds of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to push political negotiations forward.
The Russian-Turkish deal stopped a potential major attack by Russian-allied forces in Syria on a province where three million people live.
Mauleem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear time-frames" and expressed hope that military action would target al-Qaeda-linked Nusra fighters, including jihadists, who would be "disarmed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mauleem laid out the conditions for participating in the Syrian government committee, which said that the row's work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump could win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, slander and scandal prematurely end your presidency.
There is no doubt that this will be the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
So far, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled from 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled from 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News' prime-time viewership averages 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has dominated cable ratings with nearly 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand, said Neil Baer, who runs ABC's "Designated Drama Show", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the devastating attack on the Legislative Building.
Neil Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and columnist for Just the Funny Parts: and Hollywood Boys, is another example of some of the harsh truths about being a club-goer.
She recalls a cab ride she took in Boston before the 2016 election.
Let's say she told him she would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
She said, "Because they make me laugh", Mrs. Scovel told me.
A crowd has entertainment value.
Indeed, unlike anything on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether displaced families can come together, and the health of the global economy.
Being tuned is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, be a well-informed citizen when you find yourself at the sixth hour with a row of experts discussing the silly effects of Bob Woodward's book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 shark-skin bomber jacket (a thick coat with a hoodie, the Washington Post says) and Mr. Trump's, um, Stormy Daenians of anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he's doing as part of a reality show is like eating something every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "One Star", about the changing cast of The Trump Show and the daily turnaround of the storyline.
You can't afford to miss a lecture or you're left behind.
When I got there this week to see Mr. Fleiss, the sun was 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was excited to watch MSNBC while recording CNN inside.
He couldn't get himself off, Brett Kavanaugh couldn't face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's future hanging in the balance,
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but in the end they turned out to be true.

Outside money comes squeezing into the midterm election race
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of money, thanks to the redistricting of congressional districts that landed two incumbents in the same seat race.
This recently redrawn suburb of Pittsburgh surpasses district Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is strongly contested in the new 17.
The maps were redrawn after a January Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision that ruled the old districts were run secularly in favor of Republicans.
The race on Nov. 17 touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the main party's financial factions, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in a widely-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had held a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a bit more of an edge.
US imposes sanctions on El Salvador for collaborating with China, then withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a cooling backlash from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June and a hotel in Panama until the partners unveiled the Trump Organization's Management 2017 team.
State Department officials decided to recall heads of US diplomatic missions due to current decisions not to recognize Taiwan from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, said Department spokeswoman Nary Hidhar Naurate in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalty is only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic cooperation.
The suggested penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity similar to last year's that was seen as a move toward efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United Nations.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, which would effectively end any idea of sanctions for El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which will convene the administration in a sign of import, in mid-October.
And the three American envoys had peacefully returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which was described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the management, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is a source of inspiration for us.
The footprint could then be placed on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very solid evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller is also reportedly turning his research to whether Mr Trump's campaign was affected by Russia's attack on the election.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump would find himself facing accountability in that system, as he prepares to go up against a backlash from voters and perhaps eventually his colleagues.
There are many possibilities, and my suggestion is not that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or even that of his summit in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West would have prevented it and backed the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the chance to prevent the genocide that was to occur in the years to come.
Around such distinctions, the direction of the foundations of history and the dynamics of democracy are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face some of these tipping points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump were to terminate Deputy Chief Law Enforcement Officer Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been beset by problems since the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his being ineligible for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times' account is inaccurate.
How would we respond if the F.B.I. investigation of the new request for Brett's removal was not complete or sympathetic - or if the Supreme Court confirmed it despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will endure a long winter.
But I think we're not going to fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future when it is with me as my legacy?"

Ranger's Graham Dorrance is optimistic ahead of the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that following a spectacular draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a win against the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented central midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for greater things.
It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game thinking we could get something and came up with a point.
We might have won it in the final, but a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably good in the first half and we came into the second half and were on the good side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get the three points but it will be a tough game because in the last game they got a good result but, with the backing of the crowd with us, I am sure we can go forward and get a positive result.
The last year was certainly difficult, all the things that happened, like my injuries and the changes in the club itself, are also factors that now make the place feel good.
The group is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move on now, put the past behind us and succeed".
Women are losing sleep over this retirement fund scare.
Despite the survey participants having an idea of how they would like to be cared for, some were talking about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the individuals in the national-level study said they were talking to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
People want a family member to look after them, but they don't take steps to communicate, Holly Schneider, vice president of life insurance trades nationwide, said.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not communicate your wishes ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important component in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor in: Your advisor may also be able to help you with one way to pay for these expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance plan, a cash-value combination life insurance plan to cover these costs, or a self-insured plan with your own property as long as you have the money.
Get your legal documents hand-held Get legal battles off your head quickly.
Get a health care surrogate so you can hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to speak.
Also, consider having a power of attorney for your financial matters.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your adult parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write the details down in the form of a written plan so that you are ready.
Not only is money at stake, but who are the doctors? asked Martin.
What medications are there?
Who will care for the dog?
Keep that plan in mind".
A man in Ilfracombe fires several shots with an air gun
A man was shot several times with an air gun while walking home from a night hike.
The victim, Devon, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracobe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as an "unplanned act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the communication shutdown, relief officials could not get any information from the Donggala region north of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the devastation hit.
Here are some key facts about the case of Palu and Dongola, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, with an estimated 2017 population of 379,800, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a governorate with a coastline of more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) in the vicinity of Sulawesi Island.
The administrative region, an administrative region that is below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster management agencies, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred homes in Dongola.
A tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, causing loss of lives.
Indonesia is seismically located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake in Aceh Province, North Sumatra, on the west coast of Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died off the coast of Sumatra, behind the island of Nias.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, behind Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pedi Jaya-administered region of Aceh, causing damage and upheaval as people recalled the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested under allegations of domestic violence.
The eldest son of Trek Palin, former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and obstructing an arrest.
According to the police report, when a female colleague tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone from her.
Palin is being interrogated at a pre-mat-trial facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "definitely not guilty" to questioning his own application, the network noted.
Palin is facing three Class A felonies, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused of criminal activity.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin, in a car accident.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, a domestic violence crime reporting a sexual assault and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after associating her son's behavior with PTSD derived from her service in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been shut down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake just struck the back of central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the incident are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami struck, several hundred people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sephiroth Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence for a federal crime that has not been handed out in the state since 1953.
Seipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot hired truck to attack a bike path along the west side highway in lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists in its path on Oct.
According to the death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of those reasons make a possible provision for the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder with assault, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime prosecutions, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and predetermination", the lawyers said, describing how Saipov had behaved in a "disgusting, cruel and deprived manner".
The notice of intent states that the victims of the attack, including the family of the deceased, including the victims of the attack, including the victims of the attack, including the victims of the attack, including the victims of the attack, including the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the victims of the attack, the attack, the attack, the attack, the attack, the attack, the attack, the attack, the attack, the attack, the attack, the person, the incident, the incident, the incident, the incident, the incident, the incident, etc.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been almost a decade since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty case was executed in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted and sentenced two years earlier on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good for what he had done, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipow told the officers that he was motivated to attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that ISIS flags be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count charge.
David Patten, one of the federal public defender attorneys representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the action decision.
"We think that seeking the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of life in prison without any possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved", Patten said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise an army of people during a protest at a Tory convention today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had felt the heat from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bohne said in Birmingham in March that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary the UK would have been 'out' by now.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces to reclaim her deeply divided position is underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who have joined the city in separate opposition to Brexit.
The president is struggling to maintain his plan to settle his checkers amid Brexiters, reminiscent and attacks from the EU.
The allies stressed that despite the strong backlash, she would continue to try to make a deal with Brussels - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her support and "disruption".
Mr. Bone said that the rally at Solihull was a "leave it be" rally and that the "leave it be" rally was a desire to have the Chechers removed.
You suggested that Mr. Ferrez should be made a partner and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to get rid of the checker.'
Establishing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight the world wars to stay alive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that the 2016 vote had changed people's minds. The idea that the British people had changed their minds and wanted to stay is completely wrong.
Tory Brexitist Andrea Jenkins was also in the march, telling reporters: "I'll say it simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chekers are not popular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, they are popular with our group and our workers who actually work in the streets and help us get elected in the first place.
Please put the checkers down and start listening.'
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime Ministers save their jobs when they keep your promises.'
Mr. Ferreira said the rally politicians should do is feel the heat if they are going to cheat on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not leave you after it is done.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel warm, our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit.
'We are mobilizing an army of the people of this country who gave us victory over Brexit and who will not give up until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the survivors marched across Birmingham before holding a two-hour parade through the city centre.
After the group started this weekend, a handful of activists waved banners against Brexit.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives with a party app for the security problems they were facing as the conference opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can put systems in place and all the technologies for Canada plus plus so that there is a frictionless border, so that there is free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It is a complete prank.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans a tough look for the president's race
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will take a "tough look at President Mattis" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Deal, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She may have been the center of speculation that would go against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was the 36th meeting with Trump using the town hall format since she took office.
One participant asked her if she plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that covers the issue of a woman being at the top".
LSU's Seams shot dead in arrest
Police in Baton Roe, La., announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Row Police Department announced the arrest of Dyson Simson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
He released a video Friday asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Seams, 20, shot and killed near Patang, Patang South University early Friday.
A bullet wound to the head was found on the premises and eventually resulted in his death, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, per 247 Sports.
Wade came to his friend's rescue and Simpson was shot dead by Wade.
Simsson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, armed, and confessed to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Row Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Row, he played in 32 games with the Seams last season, earning 10 stars and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinches world title with victory over Sebastian Vettel at the command of the team
It was clear for the moment when Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Team Mangavel would play a big part in the Mercedes race.
From the pole, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his group mate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton in the tail of the queue in traffic, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later pitched a lap and came up behind the Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw a Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside side free of the risk of being caught after a double-step to save on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid on his 21st birthday and finished seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then relied on his tyres for the fourth time to reach a fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, thus leading for a large part of the race.
On lap 44 he finally got into the pits, but was unable to pick up his pace in the remaining eight laps as Rykon took fourth.
It's a difficult day because Voltaire did a great job over the weekend and was told by a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having a two-on-one, "Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she not break the letter from Supreme Court appointee Christine Blasey Ford accusing her of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a West Virginia rally, the president did not directly comment on Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "selfish and bad and untrue".
One of the things that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate in the last few days, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and selfish and bad and untruthful, he said.
When you see the publications and the leaks and then they say oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do this.
What is the purpose of the Memorial?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember the answer... Did you leak the document - Oh Oh Kya?
Oh, no. I was just thinking about it.
I didn't leak it".
All right, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, it was linked to the senator's influence.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford at the end of July detailing the charges against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that the leak was from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak them, Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
She told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as she told me.
But there was no refusal on her part to sit with the president, who was commenting at the Saturday night rally: "What I'm telling you, that was extremely bad body language".
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Moving on to the defense of a Supreme Court justice caught in a sexual misconduct case by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own benefit.
They are determined to take back the necessary power by any means.
You can see the selfishness, the panic, they don't care who they are hurting, they have to run for power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars beat Dundee back on Friday to win 5-3 and prepare for an Elite League defeat against Belfast Giants.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early on the offensive from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bloovier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney restored the Giants' lead before Dwyer brought home a side-level.
François Bouchard equalised the stumps before Lucas Lundwold Nielson scored two goals to secure his victory.
Adam Kiffes suffered his third Elite League defeat of the season for the Man, which was a 2-1 defeat to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener came from Kendall McFall's assist at 3:35 in the fourth minute, with David Rutherford providing the assist as the Bluevaliers doubled the lead after four minutes.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan was brought back to the home side at 13:10 before being substituted for Matt Marquart's equaliser at 15:16 to tie Cowie.
Dwyer ensured that when he scored his second goal late in the first night, the Giants won the first break.
The home side regrouped and once again Bouchard put him in level term with a power play goal at 27:37.
For the first time in a match, at the end of the second session, Colney and Charles Corcoran jointly assisted Nielsen to give the lead to Dundee and gave him victory by a fifth halfway in the final session.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are in their next match at home to Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies trying to save thousands of people from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he was confirmed dead after he successfully took off a plane packed with thousands of people.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck on Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks can destroy the area and many are trapped under the rubble in the Palo-Nagar.
After his associates fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunwan Agunge Muthiyara Sis Al Jufri Airport Pallu Airport, Ginger also had to leave his post in the control tower.
He was trying to ensure that the runway was cleared for the safe take-off of Bataic Air Flight 6321.
When he saw the control tower falling, he jumped from it.
She later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirt said the decision could save thousands of lives, according to Australia's ABC News report.
We had prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him before he reached Palu by helicopter this morning.
"When we heard this, we were very sad. "
Meanwhile, officials feared the death toll could reach the thousands, telling the country's disaster reduction agency that the towns of Dongola, Sigi and Bautong were out of reach.
SUTOPO PURRO NGURAHO, spokesperson of the agency said that while many people are yet to be reached, it is believed that many bodies are still buried under the rubble.
Waves up to six meters high have washed over the pool, with a mass burial ceremony to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Reesa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Every minute the mini market is getting looted.
Jan Gelfend, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse than this".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night so that the work related to immunization can be completed.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
In Indonesia, the Lombok earthquake earlier this year killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nyugini now says one person is missing after the plane crash in Lagan
A flight operated by AekLine crashed in Micronesia, Pacific Lagoon, now showing one person missing, while all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that the account for the male passenger was unavailable till Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, the hospital and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats assisted in rescuing other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuak Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
Why the accident happened and the exact sequence of events is not yet known.
Both the airlines and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane would overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane had come down very low.
"This is a good thing", said Janis.
Janes said he and others had managed to escape in a sinking plane, crossing waist-deep water for an emergency evacuation.
The flight attendants were screaming and yelling, and they were even slightly injured.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were making repairs on the nearby shore also assisted in the rescue, using inflatable boats to rescue people before the plane plunged into 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in the past two decades in the crashes of PNG-registered airlines, but they do not involve air pollution.
The night's timeline analyzer shows that the woman was burned alive.
A prosecution in a retrial on Saturday decided the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He mentioned before the jury how he used his cell phone records to piece together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rolette said he obtained location data from several cellphones, which contradicted Tallis's earlier claim that Tallis was with her on the evening of Chambers' death.
When the data showed that Chambers had his cell phone, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford took the stand and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tallis was telling the truth about being in the truck with Sanford that night, he said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tallis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cellphone records indicated that the couple had known each other for a week.
Rolette said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted Chambers' text, call and contact information from his phone.
He erased her from his life, Hal said.
Sunday is scheduled for the hearing of his last pleas.
The judge said he hoped to take the accused before a jury later that day.
Elite: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by infusing their music with a positive message.
The elites from Bristol claimed that hip hop moves away from its roots of political message and solution of community issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
Another black guy?!
NY nanny accuses couple after racist text
After receiving an inappropriate text message, the mother complained, filing a lawsuit against a New York nanny couple for discrimination in their dismissal.
The couple denied being racist themselves, comparing the lawsuit to a money laundering.
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was disappointed to find her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, unattended on her first day of work in 2016.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON, that was Mrs. Plasco-Flexman who texted her husband.
However, she sent the maid Maurice twice instead of sending her husband.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her mistake, an "unhelpful" Placebo-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that her current nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting Filipinos instead.
Miss Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home in a hurry.
Now, Morris is filing a lawsuit to get the couple fired, and is demanding $350 a day for six months, initially for the residential work she was hired to do, but without a contract.
I want to show you that, look, you can't do this, she told the post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination".
Responding to claims that the couple were nationalists, he said that it was right to terminate Morris' employment, as he feared he could not be trusted after humiliating him.
My wife sent her something that she didn't intend to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist, " President Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you put your child in the hands of someone you thought was wrong, even if you thought he was wrong?
What about your newborn baby?
Let go".
Comparing the campaign to "the money recovery", Plasco said that his wife had months to go before she had a baby and was going through a lot of hard times.
You follow someone, like that?
This is not a good thing, said the investment banker.
Although the legal process is still ongoing, the people's court has reacted swiftly to the social media criticism of the couple, blaming their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared the reader might not connect with a talking bear, the new letter published.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to keep a first-time reader in the seed position before publication.
We now know that this is very surprising, given Paddington's great success.
Her father, who was inspired by a little teddy bear to write a children's book, and who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, was joking about quitting his job, telling her that the books were "bitterly sweet" on the 60th anniversary of publication, and then he died last year.
Paddington, who describes himself as an important member of his family, said his father was proud of his potential success.
He was a very quiet person, and he was not an introverted person, she said.
But because Paddington was not very real to him, it was like if you have a child who has achieved something: you feel proud of him, even though he's not actually doing your work.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always credited it to Paddington".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon discharging her daughter, she was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur II in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to revive her.
Ned was always calling to say that this was really bad, because he didn't expect it to succeed, Mrs. Eden-Laprossey said.
Then I got a call from Ned saying that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
Doctors gave her medication to pump her heart, which was slowly losing its effect and leaving her system.
She had just recently passed away and all of this had stopped.
I had to sit there and wait for him, even though I knew all this.
I couldn't get angry or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I actually had to take care of this".
Finally Mrs. Adnan-Leperhaus, grieving over the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the mental anguish she was suffering.
No one knew, she said.
My head was down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to understand, but it was on the flight, I felt this heavy feeling of empathy for Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
Victim women post-card to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are posting cards on the Nyseth Whello Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to have to go through what I go through every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son Prabhani was a promising cook with a smiling face.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
He always said that his memory would light up any room".
However, before he died, he was forced to give up his work because he was "in the darkest place".
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler's brother was looking for his brother who committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there is going to be a knock on the door".
Mrs. Davis made a card, "To show people that there are many people they can go to and talk to, even if it's not just friends".
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis for years, said that shortly after Mark's mother died, she lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark.
She never told him that she was feeling sad or depressed or anything, she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his temperament.
He was very depressed on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at you or anything".
Her death was a huge shock for him, but he has to work through it: "It creates a hole in the family.
This is what sets us apart.
But we all have to go forward and keep fighting".

The future of Kwanuaad was hanging in the balance as the FBI began its search.
"I thought that we could actually get what he wanted - a limited time of exploration, a limited area of work - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, expressing concern that the committee was entangled in a partisan gridlock.
Why did Srimann Kwanyuaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Time is their will.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as is hoped, the Republicans do poorly, they will be slack in their attempt to elect their favorite man to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was calling senators, he was persuading them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who had done the White House carts for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would break Mike Pence's tie and ensure his approval for the vice-presidency of the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea under Kim decreased
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Referring to the figures, Park Byung-seok of the Ministry of Integration South said that there were 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the main reasons were the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high fees accepted by people smugglers.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
A large number of refugees from the North are eventually presented with South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The most displacement occurred through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross between the two Koreas in the Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China takes refugees as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and repeatedly forcibly returns you.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is still technically war - has improved in recent months.
The leaders met earlier this month in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearisation.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un in Singapore in June, when they broadly agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
Mr. Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that there would be no trust in our national security without any trust in America, and that in such circumstances, there was no way that we could unilaterally disarm ourselves.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "historical", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "unfit for the character of a Supreme Court justice".
Pelosi made the comments at an appearance at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
I can't help but think that if a woman had ever demonstrated in this way, she would have been "historical", Pelosi said Thursday in her response to Quanah's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sex with Dr. Christine Blaisley Ford when they were both in their virginity.
Discussing his family and the university, Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statements, often almost loud and choking.
He denounced the Democrats in the committee for unjustifiably accusing them of "violent and coordinated character assassinations" orchestrated by outright liberals, which led to Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Qwanuaugh's testimony proved that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself, in terms of the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh, if confirmed, and if the Democrats managed to gain a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi expressed skepticism.
Pelosi said that if he doesn't tell the Congress or the FBI the facts, he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court or the Court of Justice.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the potential lawsuit against the Due Process Act or Roe v. Wade because it comes in a conservative justice human.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
Pelosi said, "This is not the time for a hysterical, biased court to go to trial, and Amara is expected to say that this will not go very well".
And women need to do this.
This is the right conclusion in months and years of anger that she couldn't get out of without Rodney.
We cry when we are angry, Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is unusual, do you?
She went on to say, "I was very helped by a woman who was an employee somewhere, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique, which meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person who was talking to her, 'You think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm in a rage".
And she just keeps moving on.
And I think that was smart".
Tears are allowed as an export as part of anger, because they are inherently wrong.
One of my keenest memories from an early job in the male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with unspeakable rage, was when I was caught with my throat slit by a woman - a hot-headed manager, whom I had always been a bit afraid of - who had dragged me up a ladder.
Never let them see you cry, she told me.
They don't know that you're angry.
He thinks you are sad and he rejoices because he has come to you".
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
When Mr. Hart was caught in a boat-rigging affair, called the Monkey Business, and was eliminated from the race in 1987, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed and felt she should not consider running for president herself, for no reason.
After 30 years, she smiles and tells me that it was not a well-thought-out decision.
There were already seven contestants in the competition and the last thing they wanted was another one.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was late, she was behind on fundraising, and so she vowed not to participate in the competition until she had raised $2 million.
This was a losing battle.
She learned that some of the patrons, who had given the men $1,000, would only give her $250.
Did she think I was getting a pass? She was surprised.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run a formal campaign, she went beyond emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money, and anger at the representatives' targeting of voters and gender bias - to get trapped.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You may have thought that Kleenex was my commercial sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
She cried?""
How a US-China trade war might be worth for Beijing
Experts believe that the initial period of the US-China trade war has been a disastrous one, and that long-term benefits for Beijing could accrue until the war is over.
US President Donald Trump first warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant increase this week was the new tariff, which imposed a half-tax on all goods entering the US from China, affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods.
Beijing has retaliated each time, imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of goods in the same period.
China has promised a short-for-short match to the United States, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to do so any time soon.
To turn Washington back means to bow to the demands, but to bow publicly to the US would be highly embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing does its job properly, the pressure of the US trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic tailspin, or even worse than what previous observers in the country saw, said Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia for the Center for New American Security, a research fellow think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to send back refugees
Syria says it is willing to voluntarily return refugees, and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
He said that today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure to move forward in countering terrorism.
The Government is continuing rehabilitation in the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu-Alim said the Syrian administration would welcome assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or tolerance from countries sponsoring extremism.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating Team America by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on the European continent and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown, as Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's teens reached 14.5, defeating the United Nations was their necessity.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for much of the tournament, dipped his T-shirt into the water on the 16th hole, par-3, and won his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shone in all his travels since the tournament's current format began in 1979, with 1 of 4 players leading 5-0.
Jordan Spieth of the US was blown out 5&4 by Thorbjørn Oles of Denmark, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European winner of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry but today I am alive.
This is going to be a tough year.
So I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
Excited by the European win, Garcia said that this is about the team and I am glad I was able to help.
He takes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud, I grew up watching the man beat Tiger Woods", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.[citation needed]
The odd figure of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, was second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has struggled to get fairway all week with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
American Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, these guys fought.
It was this morning when we let some heat on Europa.
We fought back.
A greeting to Thomas.
He is the best captain.
All 12 of their players played very well.
We will all be together once again, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to serve them as captain.
You have to take off the top of your hat.
We went outside".
