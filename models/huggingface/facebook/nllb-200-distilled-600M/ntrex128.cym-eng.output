The Welsh are worried they'll look real
Some ACAs are concerned about a proposal to change their English titles to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Welsh Member of the Welsh Senedd).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
ACs across the political spectrum worry that this could be a bad thing.
Labour-backed AC said his group was worried because the title was a play on the words TUP and PUP".
And to anyone who understands Welsh: You don't want to be called by that name.
AC from South Wales said the group as a whole was pleased with the suggestion that they had offered other options.
A Welsh Conservative said his group kept an open mind about the name change, but it was suggested that there was little verbal difference between MWP and Muppet.
The ASC Welsh translation does not cause much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptions to the titles of Assembly Members will be a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals.
As for the title of Assembly Members, the Commission supported Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but the MWP came out stronger in the public consultation.
The ACU is suggesting other options, but the work to come to a consensus could lead to the death of the President, Elin Jones.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way planning works, including rules on the non-qualification of ACs and the design of the committee system.
The ACs will then vote on what they should call as they debate the legislation.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve decades-long dispute with Greece, a neighboring country that has its own island of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbourhood represents a right to its territory.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, opposes a country's name change vote and has said he will destroy the vote.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Hearsay as Churches in Harlem Faced Difficulties
"Historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner, according to the old people I've spoken to", Mr. Adams said.
Today, none of them.
He said it was understandable why the bars had disappeared.
People are socializing differently today, he said.
Bars are no longer considered community living rooms where people regularly visit.
As for churches, there is concern that the money raised by the sale of their assets will not be as long as the leaders expect it to be, and sooner or later, they will be back in the same position.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by flats with condos filled with the kind of people who won't help the rest of the area's churches.
The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white, he said, which would mean that all of these churches will close earlier because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved there in the 1930s.
A black congregation who had been worshiping nearby owned the building.
St. Martin's church was turned into a black congregational under the Parish priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's owners made plans for rebuilding, the cottages were commissioned.
Father Johnson's son and patron of St Martin's Church, Archbishop David Johnson, was proud to give them the name "The Poor People".
The expert who sang the songs in July gave them another name: Cultural Treasure and unique historical offerings.
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that these were the first choirs in the world to be sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to singing in larger choirs at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's church had no one in its place.
What has happened at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complex history of clergy and contractors, some hired by lay church leaders, and others by the Episcopal church.
The façade - the parish's governing body comprising junior leaders - wrote to the excavation in July to note concerns that the excavation would attempt to transfer the costs to the façade, although the façade had not been linked to the hiring of the builders and contractors the excavation had sent there.
Some wealthy people complained of a lack of transparency regarding the excavation.
Shark injured a 13-year-old boy as he was swimming to look for friends in California
According to officials, a 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark attack on Saturday while he was searching for friends in California, on the first day of the chemistry season.
The attack occurred just before 7am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy crying for help.
Hammel said he believed he was aroused by the boy's initial hold of a knife. But, after reaching the boy, Hammel told him to imagine he was screaming, "I have been beaten!
I've got my ass kicked!
His shoulder bridge was broken open.
I begged all to come out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was pulled from the water in a helicopter and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in critical condition.
We don't know which species of sarcophagus was responsible for the attack.
In a press release, life-saver Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said the victim had suffered injuries to the upper body.
The beach access officers registered from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security and investigation purposes.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area but most of them are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK beauty market
Sainsburys competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty abilities in the form of spiral shops that feature specialist assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK beauty market, a £2.8bn market that continues to grow despite falling fashion and home goods sales, these larger beauty properties will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
This investment comes to the beauty world as supermarkets look for ways to use empty shelves after being haunted by TV sets, microdons and home goods.
Sainsburys said it would double its beauty product portfolio by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you would see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique colour collection so that most products are poetic - something that is increasingly being called for among young shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will be testing concessions in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying a little food every day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets must do more to encourage people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsburys, said the outlets will look more like turnkey shops as the supermarket chain tries to compete with the discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and goods than food.
Sainsbury's has been offering Argos products in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat products since purchasing the two chains two years ago.
The former effort of the supermarket failed to re-champion its parts of beauty and charm.
Sainsburys proposed a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership ended following a dispute over how to divide the revenue of the pharmacy's stores into supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's, three years ago, sold its philanthropic business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He said Lloyds would be part of the scheme as it would add an extensive range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have completely changed the look and feel of our beauty shoes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean we are now at the pinnacle of a vital beauty that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is a candy bar who has to holly willoughby pull out of a £11 million bargain
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, was a cheerleader after television presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out a £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business, in order to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand of household goods and goods.
The couple's business had been compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
Willoughby, one of the hosts of This Morning, had posted an Instagram message announcing his departure.
Peter Jones, one of the Dragons Den stars, is in the process of having Holly Willoughby pull out of a profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own big new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was a widower on Tuesday when the presenter at a meeting at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time for Truly, their brand of household goods and furniture.
The business was compared to the Paltrow Gwyneth Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby's fortune, an estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones travelled from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
That was her long-term future and the work she would have done over the next decades.
Everyone was surprised to hear that she had decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, and it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, ready to be sold.
Experts believe that this decision by one of Britain's most bankable stars could cost the company millions due to a large investment in products, including smartphones, candles, clothing and household items. This could also be further delayed before launch.
Perhaps this will also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
He co-founded Willoughby Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple go on holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's presenter of Im A Celebrity.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We won't comment on his business matters.
It was hard, of course, but then we fell in love.
He made fun of the media's allegations of making a presidential comment, according to some, and of being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump wasted so much time?
Trump said by four news anchors.
I didn't leave anything.
Kim said he was eager to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting Trump described as a major step forward for North Korea's declaration.
However, discussions on de-nuclearisation have slowed down.
Less than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not believe the US is responding in line with North Korea's early denuclearization moves.
Instead, he said the UDA continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was much more busy in his great speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results - giving up rocket testing, helping to free the warheads and ensuring that the rest of the American troops are returning home.
He went on to justify his unusual behavior in terms of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this full arena, we would have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the front door.
Tsunami and Indonesian landslide destroy Island, by Ladd Hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, something that is essential to catalyzing international support.
"We have seen many cases, unfortunately, they have explained that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is quite challenging", Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is creating a team to travel to Palu, they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given support.
Because the earthquake in Indonesia is constant, the country is not prepared enough for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other occasions.
No tsunami warning was apparently received in Palu, although a warning was issued, which contributed to the death toll.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is difficult at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that had been docked in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's modern infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But a lack of money has been a concern for Mr Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from long-standing nominative tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have taken a more conservative form on the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, spears and arrows, as well as other deadly weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool, scoring a goal in a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge prevented Liverpool from losing a Premier League match to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was bowled out for 30 by Xherdan Shaqiri and scored around 30 runs for Chelsea with his team losing 1-0.
The ball went to the left before shooting towards the top post.
The ball rose high above the box as it moved towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball came down for the Arrizabalaga Cup as he jumped and the ball dropped into the net.
"I was trying to get to that site and get the ball and players like Shaq always play when that's possible, so I was trying to make as much time as possible for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and ask the ball without thinking too much about it, just go about it.
Chelsea were later beaten 1-0 by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea team's shooter threw the ball back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away near the centre of the field and spinning into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic gave a bus a quick ride in the middle of the field.
Then. the ball bounced forward gently between the other team's defenders, leading Hazard to the boxer.
Hazard was a faster than the defending champion who finished in the top-flight with a left-footed chic passing to Alisson Becker, one of Liverpool's players.
Liverpool play against Napoli in a group match in the Premier League at 3pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European Championship at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll following the tsunami Indonesia rises to 832
The total death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly lying in the middle of a building collapse that came down when the 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit on Friday, causing landslides as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was covered in many buildings that were destroyed.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation into the murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Mhenbedw, Glens Dwrdwy, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found shot in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to report if they heard or saw anything.
Detective Inspector Brian OHagan said: "If the investigation is just beginning, I will ask anyone in the John Street area of Mhenbedw to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, has caught anything on touch cameras, they should contact us for fear that they have information that is essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found with her body was from the Penbedw area and that her body was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are informing the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back into his flat but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He had no words when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now being told that they will have to wait a few hours before getting back in.
One police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
The woman approached the site in tears.
She keeps repeating this is so terrible.
At 2pm there were two police stations in the corridor and another outside.
Several officers were standing in the loft monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111 and recording 247 30 September.
Cromwell's story outside the Senedd is the latest memory of being part of the history of the world championship
The removal of the scroll would be a barbarous justification for the terrible destruction that caused so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, the destruction made by its fanatical Prussian followers.
But the Cromwell Society said Mr Crick's suggestion was one of the most important attempts to re-champion history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable, in the current debate on the elimination of cripples, that the figure of Oliver Cromell outside St Stephen's Palace would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for the execution or command of the econoclasticity of the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of late 19th century and is part of a fictional history that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, in the 19th century more than perhaps today, consider Cromwell to be a figure who defended the parliament from external pressure, which is the monarchy in his case.
I don't know if that's true or not and that's an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has influenced the development of our country since then and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of the debate.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and memorial.
Mochin Reibus Burying a Farmer in China
A farmer was killed by a cat in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man, known by his nickname Yuan, was found dead by a car bomb in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province.
A chicken farmer was preparing to plant vaccines on a chicken farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have travelled with his band from the nearby town of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 foxes at the market.
The next morning. his guard found him dead and noticed that a door of a nearby car door was open.
He said that a large male mouse was in the hole and that there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation determined that the 550-pound machine had broken a farmer to death, according to the report.
"My shoulder legs were broken and they were all bloody", said the shoulder, who was named after his shoulder, Wu, according to a statement in the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his dog.
A body was found about an hour later.
Yuan nai fender was not the animal that killed the man.
One of the market's managers told the Evening News that the machine had been locked down to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the site.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly discussing his death in an open debate.
Although there are few, there are other records of cases of people being attacked by a mole.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a machine on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years later, a 650 pound machine captured a Welsh farmer against his tractor until a woman scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his dog in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the chicken is not usually aggressive but that blood taste can cause them to behave like that.
They're being cruel.
They're young, very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You must give them enough respect, he said.
The roaring Rose has caused heavy rainfall over a large area of the southwestern United States
According to the projections, the Rosa Corvette is shrinking as it moves over the warmer waters of the western coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause heavy rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, from 5am Eastern time on Sunday.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a ship begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peak on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, the storm will begin to blow a deep tropical wave north to southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical wave will then react with the approaching strong winds causing heavy rain over the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous heavy flooding, a surge of rubble and possible desert landslides.
Deep tropical precipitation will cause rainfall rates of between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
A major flood with such conditions may rapidly worsen due to the unpredictable nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be very annoying to venture out into the wilderness on foot with the threat of a tropical wave.
Heavy rainfall could cause the wetlands to become wild rivers and a storm of fur and tarnish could cause strong winds and mudslides in the area.
The approaching vessel will cause some local heavy hand in parts of the coast of Southern California.
A total of more than half an inch of hand may fall, which could cause a small flow of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the area's first call during its peak season.
A few scattered tropical storms will begin arriving in Arizona late on Sunday night and early Monday morning, before rain spreads further late on Monday and Tuesday nights.
Heavy rain will spread to the Cornel Valley area on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
The weather will change dramatically across the US during October as Arctic winters, but the tropics will remain fairly hot.
This sometimes leads to significant changes in temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature across the US average on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remnants of summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
A large part of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to start warming in October with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts show a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. throughout the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexual abuse in the 1980s, testify, on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, political disagreement continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular schedules to air the unexpected moment on Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake stipulated that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her improperly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party, and he confessed.
Kavanaugh said in giving his evidence that he was absolutely certain that did not happen.
It is likely to have been viewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company averaged audience numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not directly available for other networks it was showing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To give perspective, the size of this audience was similar to an audience that would watch a football game or Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, the channel's opinion guests have given strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, who led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the audition, which was held throughout the day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
Much interest followed the hearing as well.
Flake was the prominent figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office declared he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning with protesters yelling at him as he tried to go into an elevator to hear the Judiciary Committee.
He was standing looking around the floor for a few minutes as he got his head blown off, live on CNN television.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power and so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say after the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filmed live hours later, when it was time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination and have a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nomination by the following week, a result that minority Democrats have been urging him to.
Flake was partially persuaded after discussing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the ballots to approve Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
AS Britain accuses May of playing politics in the Brexit case
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who condemned her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and of undermining the national interest.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 29 September 2018.
In another interview while she was on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, was criticizing what she called the Chequers scheme for Brexit, saying it was a ridiculous proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Simpson on suspicion of killing one of LSU's players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will be serving time in prison on suspicion of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released video of Sims and Simpson's clash, and police say Sims lost his spectacle during the fact.
Police found a spectre of Simpson's DNA on the site, and they say they have found it.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde and killing her.
He has a fund of $350,000, the Irishman said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying a gunshot wound to the head in the leg was the cause of death.
The department commends the recruitment of Louisiana State Police fugitives, the state police crime lab, the University of the South police and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the local law enforcement team for their dedication and work to ensure justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday, LSU football coach Will Wade said the team had turned their hearts to fear after hearing about Wayde's death.
This is the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
A volcano is sending ash over Mexico City
Heavy rainfall from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Trauma Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after activity increased in the reservoir and 183 oil and mud discharges were recorded over 24 hours.
The centre monitored a number of collections and drawings.
Social media images showed thin layers of mud covering the front windows of a car in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the volcano's activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is called Don Goyo and has been in existence since 1994.
The police clash with Catalan invaders before celebrating a year since the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two pro-independence protesters opposed the anti-corruption police and as thousands joined competitive protests to mark a year since Catalonia's split vote on secession.
A group of protesters broke up with anti-graft police who were holding them back with powdered wax and paint, creating dark clouds of sand in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, riots were also held, with police using their batons to control the fighting.
For hours, pro-independence groups were chanting Don't forget, no apologies and unilateral protesters were chanting Here is Spain.
14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in this area which has been at the time of independence, a year after the referendum of 1 October which Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by the strongly invading Catalans.
The vast majority of voters chose to become independent, but not many people came to vote and those who opposed secession significantly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the vote at polling stations across the region in violent protests.
Independence groups were in the Wener night camp to prevent opposition from the national police.
The opposition went ahead but he was forced to follow another trend.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to the protesters' protest with his wife, was no longer concerned about Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year, we had one of the best moments ever.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness at being able to vote but we are back in the same old situation now, he said.
Despite winning a small but crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independence groups have found it difficult to maintain momentum to go ahead and many of the most well-known leaders have either resigned themselves or waited for a trial to help organise the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on her phone to support the police, politicians on both sides had been stirring up the waters during the riots.
The bad mood is increasing, he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Considering myself a candidate for the European elections is the best way to celebrate the return to democratic values and the excesses we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after being pushed into a house in Londonderry multiple times.
This happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Detective Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to both the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been shot at the car at some point as well.
Menga's goal was to secure a 1-0 victory for Livingston against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal over Livingston ensures a victory for Livingston
Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose for the second time in 18 games as club manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strength was the difference as Gary Holt's team rose to Hibernian level in a split second.
Gerrard's team are without a home game in the Premier League this season and they face Hearts on Saturday, who are on the verge of an eight-point lead.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host a match against Rapid Vienna in the European Championship on Thursday.
Livingston has meanwhile played six consecutive games in the minors, and the current head coach, Holt, has not missed a game since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is losing opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored and their direct nature caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but lost his effort across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could not but pursue his effort wide after slipping to meet Craig Halkett's penalty across the goal,
The home team were willing to let the Rangers play their games, knowing that they could cause difficulties for others in certain places.
And that's how the important goal was scored.
The Rangers kicked a free kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
The Rangers were then in control of the ball but could not break through the home team's defenders and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not worried much.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to leave.
Scott Pittman was turned down at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, who had the ball widely kicked from another playing set by Livingston.
Passers-by continued to come to Livingston's fox and they continued to be cleared, and were given two penalty kicks - after Halkett challenged the player's rival, Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - to be thrown out.
Sorry performance by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of the BBC Scotland analysts at Tony Macaroni Arena
A surprising performance and performance for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise their expectations on this downward path.
Their style of play and staff have not changed much since they reached the top, but Holt must be commended for the way he has motivated the team since he arrived.
He had so many soldiers.
Captain Halkett was excellent, setting up a highly orderly defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet throughout the game.
But, the Rangers didn't have much inspiration.
Although they had played well at times under Gerrard, their standards were not seen.
They had a great grip on their last ball - only once they opened the home side - and it was a bit of a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Welcome to Erdogan in Cologne
It was a warm, cheerful Saturday (May 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, a visit to try to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of movement and Turkey's entry into the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new magnificent mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police had given security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had come to the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Germans, made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome the country.
These protesting politicians reflect the close connection between the visitor, a man considered a hero by some German Turks and an autocrat by others.
Car accident in Deptford: Motorcyclist killed in a car crash
A motorcyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics came, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another mechanic died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
Road closure arrangements and directions have been set up and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a fall
Six officers have been injured in a fall in a high-security male prison, according to the Prison Office.
The tornado occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case is ongoing.
Specialised Tornado officers have been called in to deal with the storm, which involves eight prisoners and occurs in only one fence.
The officers' small injuries to their foreheads were treated at the site.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: Specialised prison staff have gone there to deal with this ongoing incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can spend more time in prison.
His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison governor had been treated in hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
And in October last year, anti-corruption officers were called to the prison to deal with a severe hailstorm where the staff were attacked with a mob.
Corwin Rosa in the Great Flood Zone in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Perhaps the Dry Areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that is likely to happen early next week as the rest of the Rosa Corvette travels across the Southwest Desert, causing a risk of heavy rainfall.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will monitor heavy flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, turning her hand late on Monday night.
In a Twitter post, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Center on Mining's latest models predict between 2 and 4 inches of arm, with a rare example of a total length of up to 6 inches on the Mogollon Trail in Arizona.
Other areas in the Southwest Desert including the Great Basin and the central Rockies are likely to be between 1 and 2 inches, with a total case size of up to 4 inches possibly.
For those who are not at risk of severe flooding, rainfall Rosa can be beneficial as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial due to the current dry conditions in the South West.
According to the U.S. Security Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona experiences extreme drought at least, the highest category but one, weather.com said.
Initially, the Rosa Trail will lead to land along the Baja California mountain range, Mexico.
Rosa, which was still as strong as the Sunday morning wind with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northward at 12 miles per hour.
The storm reaches the warmer waters of the Pacific Ocean and is thus weakening.
For this reason, a storm is expected to hit land in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or on a lunar night.
Heavy rainfall could overtake parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with a potential of up to 10 inches, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a low-pressure storm, then travel up through Arizona and south to Utah arriving late Tuesday night.
The main threat to the Rosa or coral reefs is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern U.S. Virgin Islands, the National Center on Gyre said.
This rainfall is expected to create large, life-threatening floods as well as a wave of desert rubble and landslides on wetlands.
Midsomer Norton case: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and remains there in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officers have asked anyone with material on their mobile phone since the incident to submit that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered a coup and a dictatorship of the Democratic Party
The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to oppose the Democratic Party's proven and well-known tactics, Trump said in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered from the backlash and dictatorship of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and was under fire in defending the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually abused decades ago, both in their twenties.
Ford testified at the hearing about his claim as well.
The President said Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's greatness and quality and courage that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal practitioners of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding history of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in Northern Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking about the importance of the Republican assembly in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not applying, but I'm really applying, he said.
That's why I go everywhere trying to fight for great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to resist and hinder.
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday, the senior assistant GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds are killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them asleep as violent waves hit the beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres hit the beach late at night, drawing many away from there to kill and damage anything along the route.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was received yesterday, people were carrying out activities on the beach, they did not run away from it immediately and became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not on its own, it was raining cars, pumpkins, houses, it was hitting everything on the ground, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometres (497 mi) before hitting the beach.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops being damaged, bridges collapsing and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city was still shaken by the aftermath on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by a massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and winding road, may have measured the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as a total one and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been silent.
The bodies of some victims were found still buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area known as Donggata, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
There was no way to contact Donggala for information, Nugroho said.
More than 300,00 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff were volunteering on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a disaster already, but it could make the situation worse", he said.
The agency was charged with failing to report a tsunami hit Palu on Saturday, although officials say the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film shared on social media, a man on the high ground can be heard shouting at people in the down streets warning them that a tsunami is on its way.
Within minutes a wall of water was breaking through, sweeping away buildings and buildings.
Reuters was unable to verify the film directly.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large electrical discharge that erased the communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but those who have been forced to leave their homes are in real need of food and other supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened only for support efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to go to the rescue centres in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 have died in the Indonesian Tsunami.
She is a terrible wreck.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu city, where workers are being sheltered in the tarpolin sheds that have been installed in their office yard, they have been passing through disturbing scenes on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they'd seen many houses destroyed, he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as support groups go about their initial discourse of providing emergency aid, some have complained that specialist foreign aid workers have been banned from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies or staff cannot be provided unless the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a threat on the ground", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government said, jawn, this is a national disaster, we can get international support, but no status yet.
As she was sleeping in Palu again after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were hoping that their loved ones would survive some kind of miracle, which would bring some relief from the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from a carpenter's crib.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to free a woman who had been confined for two days with her mother's body in her lap.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesia national paragliding team, had trained two senior paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier in the month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi said that his pupils were among the others staying at the Roa Roa hotel.
"If someone has experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional problems", she said.
In the hours after the community heard the news that Roa Roa Hotel had gone quiet, Mr. Gendon said he had sent a series of WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were taking part in the beach party.
But only one dirty tick was next to his messages, rather than two blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages have not been sent", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as an ATM machine is refilled in Newport on the Levee
Fore Gwener was robbed of $26,750 by a Brink worker who was refilling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been breaking an ATM machine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide additional money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was to be supplied.
Witnesses saw many others flee the scene, according to the statement, but police did not say how many were involved.
Anyone with information about who these people are should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is formally known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been called Ye since he used the name as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
He is set to make a change before appearing on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He's going to the show to replace Ariana Grande, the American singer who retired for emotional reasons, said the show's creators.
In addition to being a student of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
I believe that ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means chi, West's mother earlier this year discussed the title of her album with Big Boy, who presented it on the radio.
So I am you, I am us, we are not this.
The name Kanye, meaning the only one, went to Ye alone by reflecting the good, the bad and the ugly, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are.
Among many other famous rappers are those who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been given various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to collaborate with West, has also been using her name by varying the ending and the flowers.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use troops against civilians
Mexico's mayor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloody massacre against students.
On Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed never to use the military to subjugate the people of Mexico.
The military burned during a peaceful protest on the plaza on 2 October 1968, killing as many as 300 people, as left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing grants to those who want to study and opening more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities mean that young people are being targeted by criminal gangs.
The US should double its target for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the money it spends on research in the field, said AI practitioner and investor Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments follow on various parts of the US government making publications on artificial intelligence, although the US does not have a formal artificial intelligence strategy in general.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year, which aims to be the best country in terms of all innovations by 2030.
Double funding for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are much less developed than the USA, and we are looking for the next discovery in AI, Lee said.
Doubling funding could mean doubling the opportunity to ensure that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence is achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that named him the best Othello player in America.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's previous technology competitions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next monitors.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to earn government grants, Lee said.
"China is not stealing academic leaders; it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently tried to hire brilliant college graduates to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to the immigration policy could help the U.S. to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to people with a mastery of artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Understanding Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations provide funding to researchers from the USA, but the standard of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced that a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence is being formed.
This month DARPA announced an investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in Artificial Intelligence Research Works.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in effect for months.
Macedonian citizens vote in a referendum on changing the country's borders
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a nickname Macedonia, claims that its nickname represents a right to its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's predominant Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign to vote has raised doubts about whether the number of voters will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
The referendum question is: Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and EU and accept the agreement with Greece?
Those in favour of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the only developing countries after the fall of Yugoslavia, to gain access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I've come here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because that will ensure safer lives for all of us", said Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally bound, enough members of parliament have said they will wait for the outcome of the vote to make it a definitive vote.
To change the name would have to have a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The provincial election commission said it was not talking about any inconsistencies by 1pm.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
I'm here to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on the name change in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would mean the country could join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of a building that had been set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join by being able to keep our heads high, not through the door of the servants", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that becoming a NATO member will ensure the investment it really needs in Macedonia, a country whose unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after his vote.
He said the outcome of the election would shape our future.
According to a poll conducted last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents intended to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for the party.
For a referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 per cent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious blow to the Western-favorite government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, passing all of Brighton's defenders and scoring
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defenders in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made that look awfully easy as he scored in the 65th minute.
The applicant of the Ariannin River had a bus in the middle of the field at the beginning of the line.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green trees.
One defender fell off before running faster than many others on the Brighton boxing side.
He then gave a left-handed pitch, giving the ball to Sterling.
The England forward used his first kick in the box to return the ball to Aguero, and used his right shoe to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed spin.
Aguero is having some foot problems, Manceña City manager Pep Guardiola told the crowd.
We had talked about it playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he had scored a goal at that time.
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's outfield that time.
He gave Leroy Sane a nice kick through the players along the back court.
Sane touched the ball a few times before Prince Sterling came to the top of the post.
The Chelsea forward scored the ball to the net before slipping across the boundaries.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer about to play against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have no hope of competing in the second-chance games, there is little reason to force another starter.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on the sidelines on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are consequences for the Rockies' second-chance games, which saves the Los Angeles Dodgers from a single game in the NL West.
The Rockies secured a second chance at least with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Wener night, but they still hope to secure their place in the first group.
Even if we're not playing for anything, at least we can turn the tide knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level that we will face next year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in a game like that?
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but they say they are keen to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and would be off on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is rallying in Northern Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and spoke about the importance of the Assembly of the Republic in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done will be in the month of November.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big ones. I'm not applying but I'm really applying, which is why I travel everywhere fighting for great candidates, he said.
Trump went on, "You see the horrible, terrible radical group here, you see this happening this morning.
And they are determined to take back power by using whatever means necessary, you see the retaliation, the malaise.
They have no idea who is to be tortured, who has to be overthrown to gain power and authority. They want power and authority, and we are not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are trying to resist and stop.
"And we've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "flat and white and unimportant and unpopular".
He referred to the name of the senior Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a loud noise was heard among the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you share the document?
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a second - that was an example of poor body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad-based party.
The party does not allow those who speak to speak.
When Momentum executives in my local militia voted to elect me, it was a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labourers to hear that we are not welcome - and that is to say our word.
My fellow parliamentarian, Joan Ryan, has been treated similarly for her resolute opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the proposal of a strike was to overthrow me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagree with him on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues to those Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in their circle.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
During most of my eight years as a local Labour AS, the Wener night GC meetings have been such meetings.
Unfortunately, this is not the case at most meetings today and we have long forgotten the promise of a more caring, more relaxed politics, whether ever it was.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not accepted in the Labour Party and that each viewpoint is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues I used to think were expecting me to make a political commitment and support views I would not have otherwise agreed with - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I actually say - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my neutrality, condemning the centre's politics, telling me not to be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are analyzed tend to be political.
I admire the professional and decisive nature of those colleagues who face many sexual or racial abuse every day but do not let that get the better of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are not so far-fetched now and with every proposal of a confidence vote or change to election rules, the party becomes more vocal.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to express my judgment too much, then I'll be ia.
But that's not why I chose to be a politician.
I came across Labour as a school pupil 32 years ago, shocked by the scandals of the Thatcher government, a government that was responsible for the turmoil of my coeducational classroom.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would have been able to misunderstand my political views in areas where I disagree with their current leadership.
For those who promoted Friday's proposal, all I have to say is that I don't understand the urge to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader with the country moving towards a Brexit that will be hard on households, businesses and public services.
But, in fact, it is not a message to Momentum Nottingham that I have, but a message to my constituents, Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats from my non-partisan or political amusement will prevent me from acting in the way I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is uncomfortable on the hill
Two late applications may have somewhat offended the final result, but Ayr are certainly worthy of winning this Tennent League match.
They're now at the top of the table, the only team that hasn't been knocked out by ten.
In the end, their excellent defensive work, as well as their exploitation of opportunities, was responsible for the home team's maintenance and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We've had challenging games so far, but no one has beat us, so I have to be content, he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "They should praise Ayr, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did.
Grant Anderson applied in the 14th minute, and was converted by Frazier Climo, securing Ayr ahead. However, the honey card received by Scotland's captain, Rory Hughes, and released for the game by the Warriors meant that Melrose could take advantage of that and Jason Baggot applied without being converted.
Climo ensured Ayr were more ever ahead with a penalty kick, before he, just before halftime, scored and converted an individual request to secure a score of 17-5 to Ayr in the interval.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's request, which was turned by Baggot, reduced the hole to five points.
After they resumed, Ayr had more success following a request from Stafford McDowall, who was turned over by Climo.
Ayr's interim captain Blair Macpherson was then given a honey card, and again, Melrose made an extra player pay with a spare spare by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a honeycomb for the Climo's uncapped tackle, off the penalty line, MacPherson dropped the ball behind Ayr's increasing sgarmes.
Climo passed the request, as he did again almost immediately after resumes, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's fox chick and sent the quarterback Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth request.
Seren Still Game is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran hopes to move into the hospitality industry after discovering he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, alongside writing and acting alongside his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The twelve have announced that the ninth series is in the works and will be the last in the show's history and Kiernan is likely planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but one Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan hoped to be part of a thriving Glasgow restaurant business.
No sea: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters of a regimental ship in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a warm flag like the sea.
Marine centers from the Titicaca Line to the Amazon are painted by the stars: they are rightfully sea stars.
Its recovery is a duty.
Bolivia is surrounded and the memory of the forlin that was lost to Chile in a 19th-century resource-related bloodshed is still alive - as is the memory of the Pacific Ocean sailing again.
These hopes are more ambitious than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of debate.
Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of unity and calm, and for good reason is busy waiting for the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Several Bolivian citizens will watch the international court's ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim - after decades of heated talks - that Chile must debate opening the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, a charismatic and proud Bolivian president - who faces a contentious battle for next year's survival - relies heavily on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia - and not much would change if the court did.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to judge the Chilean territory, and has insisted that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the international court's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was not as complex, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean man who specializes in international law.
And rather than improving the case of Bolivia, it is possible that the last four years have worsened the case.
The current Bolivian administration has been debating this issue of access to the sea, said Zárate.
The warrior ruler Morales has overturned any goodwill Chile had after, he suggested.
Once again, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, denied the idea that the court's decision-making process is usually a fast process.
On Monday Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of ties with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement over economic benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Marales - still one of Latin America's most popular symbols - used the maritime issue as a political bait.
Bolivia will not deny its right of access to the Pacific, he added.
The judgment is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says it will not get rid of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be stripped of its nuclear weapons unless the ball trusts Washington first.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the pledges made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of a nuclear diplomacy resumption that would not be able to reach an agreement, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the idea that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to declaring an end to the Korean War would make the North a stagnant dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the statement before Pyongyang makes significant evacuation moves first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are seeking a second summit.
But there is much doubt as to whether Pyongyang is serious about disarming what the country, more likely, regards as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shoe reveals that the latest collection of fabulous headwear is about to reach your main street
If you want a different hat or if you want to completely stop the sun, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a variety of unique and groundbreaking headwear for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which was shining on the set of styles at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unusual hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the extraordinary creations of these designers have been seen on the fashion scene.
One of Valentino's notable items was a stripped-down, over-the-top, stripped-down, leather hat with a fibrous coat covering the heads of the models.
Other large buildings included water melons filled with toys, golden hats and even pineapples - but these hats would not warm your head.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of strange moments- and that was a good time for Winter Calan.
Many of the colourful web designs had interlaced pages and were more suitable for Hannibal Lecter than for a carpet design.
One of them resembled a plumber's robe with a snorcel and a gown, and the other looked like a woolly robe, and that was a knot.
And, if you enjoy big fashion announcements-- this is your chance.
Those who keep an eye on the stele predict that dangerous bonnets could reach your main street.
These large hats follow the style of La Bomba, the popular two-foot-tall fur hats, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind these unusual hats seen on social media also had another big creation on the fashion scene - a hair bag almost as big as a model in a swimsuit he was wearing.
The flaming, flaming, white-collared bag, decorated with a white-collared ribbon and a white-paper handle, was one of the most impressive items in the collection of La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags reach the main street next summer - with the designer having made so much impression, it would be difficult to avoid the demand for big buildings.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a good reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the examinations, which is only supported by individual and joint success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement leading school curricula, we see modern languages as a popular subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, they will remember it.
If you speak to someone in his own language, that will be in your heart.
This is a powerful message to remind us that we cannot rely solely on English when trying to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of recent year's examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the charts and include the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages have obtained a high A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72 per cent of pupils have obtained a Higher A degree in Mandarin, and that 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish have obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages, as subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that language skills shortages were responsible for 17 per cent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies.
Therefore, there is an increasing call for languages to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more advanced job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he or she has learned a second language, he or she will have a real future benefit from such a long-term skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will be able to move forward immediately.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowledge of a number of languages, especially languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will have different languages to teach.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools teaching languages will be considered the most important for the UK as we look at 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, and the schools will have a highly skilled teaching staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare young children to master the skills they need to succeed, whatever their background.
At present, in a global business environment, languages can be undeniably still vital to the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as international communication methods.
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice, the diversity and excellence of this kind for young people in Scotland.
There's a good place to watch.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the season before the start of the season Sunday receiving the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he'll play yet.
It'll be more than one but less than 48, Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers coach Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this point in my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Time of the West Virginia Trump rally, YouTube channel
President Trump is launching a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his nomination for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking to win support for the midterm elections as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
The Trump rally is in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to debate this week's hearings on his nomination to the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh, who is under strain as a result of allegations of sexual misconduct with the vote to confirm in parliament delayed for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main aim of the rally series is to help hardline Republicans face tough elections in November to gain some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies over the next week would aim to spur volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and add to their Senate and House majority, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important on the agenda until the President travels to as many states as possible before the start of the important campaign term", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be highlighted by the Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a landmark that gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the pinning polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come here to try to boost his bottom line", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Fear Cup: Team USA show the pool to fight forward as they go to individual games on Sunday
After three one-hour sessions, a four-hour Saturday afternoon could be just what this Cup of Fear needed.
The momentum pedal is a concept that has been envisioned in the sports world but is a concept that players believe in especially in competitions like this.
So, where would they say the momentum is now?
"They were ahead of six points and now it's four, so we have a little momentum because I know", Jordan said as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the table with another twelve to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel they have a little wind in their spirits and they have enough to cheer up, especially by Speith and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and scored three points out of four of the same.
Speith has been excellent in his field and leads by example.
The festivities of the festival went higher as the round went on, succeeding with a vital ball to go on a game to four one though he was of and Thomas had been down two by two.
There was a similar fight after the chicken won the game to them on the 15th, the kind of a dark fight that tells you that I don't think America is out of it again.
You have to focus and worry about your own gem, said Speith.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to create an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unfortunate story of the Fear Cup.
They have a couple but love Europe four for four and out they do nothing wrong.
Mollywood was the only bar that didn't have a Saturday afternoon box, and they didn't have a Saturday morning box, Friday afternoon or the last nine in the morning.
That race, and the way the energy flows between them and the golf course confirm that they are the players to be racing on Sunday, and the same player would be more popular to claim a European victory when winning the right to race over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible both on the same foot on different shades.
But it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made Sergio Garcia, a morning four-ball hero, feel easy when he was beaten by Alex Noren.
After the first nine boxes and two doubles the Spinner and the Sword were in a hole and they were not close to climbing out of it.
But on Sunday no one will help you out of your hole.
There are four pay-per-view games that are interesting to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe have so far played better as a team and they lead a bit at the start of the last day, but the four-player session has proved that Team USA has the ability to fight, something that some in the USA were particularly suspicious of.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Cup of Fear
Europe has a significant advantage on the final day of the FA Cup after finishing four football games and four games on Saturday 10-6 ahead of the USA.
The incredible duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two victories over Tiger Woods to go on to score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
European player Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to regain his place after losing in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American whale cart in four matches of the morning, going back to 3-1.
The U.S. gave more resistance in the four quarters, but they could not eliminate the shortfall.
Jim Furyk's car needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the ball.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points and he and Molinari, who have been named Molliwood after an incredible weekend, are the second bar to score four points out of four opening games in the history of the FA Cup.
After scoring four goals, Woods and Patrick Reed worked together to beat Woods on the American rocket Bryson Started from 5 and 4.
Wood, who scored two goals on Saturday, got some special opportunities but has lost 19 of 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had been unsuccessful for the morning football match, came on as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the quarter-finals and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in first and third place in the world of 2 and 1.
Everything went wrong in Europe on a nice, sunny day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the four games after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team come back from four points behind at the start of an individual match, although only a level score is needed on the Furyk side as they are the fools of the game.
But, after being second for two days, coming in their shadows on Sunday looked like it was beyond my ability.
North Korea says they won't be a monopoly without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the continued sanctions were fueling US misconduct and the country would not be unilaterally removed from nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken significant goodwill measures in the past year, including ending nuclear exercises and disarmament, decommissioning a nuclear test site, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
But, we don't see such a response from the US, he said.
"Trusting the US will lead to no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances we cannot defend ourselves first".
Although Ri has repeated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual response to denuclearization whereby the North Korean regime is rewarded with gradual steps, his statement was significant as he did not reject a single-issue denuclearization altogether as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the current US president and the North Korean ambassador in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula while Trump pledged to guarantee the security of Korea.
North Korea has been trying to get a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls for the imposition of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US demands to get nuclear-armed first and they increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compulsory manner, and they even oppose a declaration to end the war, RI said.
The creature that sanctions can overcome us is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions reinforce our bad habits.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, a summit the president had called at the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister noted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five years and added: If South Korea's party were a de-nuclearisation issue and not the US, de-nuclearising the Korean peninsula would not lead to such an impossible situation.
However, Ri's report was quite different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US's targeting of North Korean rockets was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
Last year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to de-nuclearise, but said there was still a lot of work to do and that sanctions would have to wait until North Korea was de-nuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a specific time frame for this, saying How long does it take two years, three years or five months - no ounces.
China and Russia are arguing that the UN General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday: The Security Council sanctions must be strictly enforced and unnecessarily enforced until we realize and confirm complete denuclearization.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to try to restrict funding for Pyongyang's nuclear programs and missions.
Ri met Pompeo at the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not been a success.#
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him within hours of committing gangster acts.
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to unveil a nuclear plant and a nuclear site if the U.S. takes appropriate steps.
He said Kim had told him that he was asking about the security guarantees Trump had denied in Singapore and moves towards normalizing relations with the US.
Harvard students get a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting its graduates to sleep more in order to try to tackle the macho culture of studying through the night using caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's best universities are often confused when it comes to their own academic principles.
Charles Czeisler, professor of obstetrics at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital who designed the course, the first accredited course of its kind in the USA.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of a learning disability.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I only learning this now, in my senior year?"
He said no one had told him about the importance of a kiss - it surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being presented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffer from severe coughing deficiency during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section features a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how a lack of exercise affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term urinary incontinence increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
We are aware that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we do not believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know what the health impact of smoking is", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night is still alive, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressures on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem,
You should make sure you have enough exercise, and that quality exercise, is a way for students to deal with stress, blindness and anxiety, he says - even to avoid putting pressure on, because lack of exercise makes the brain believe you're drowsy, making you drowsy all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who was studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after studying one of his first year courses at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to get the course for the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study plan before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for going to sleep, as well as for waking up, and are aware of the harmful effects of green lights emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can affect your circadian rhythm leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal by Menga beating Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another poor away game as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's untied team at Livingstone.
Ibrox were looking for their first road win since they beat St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt Gerrard's side were forced to free the second time in 18 games as manager to leave the team eight points behind the Ladbrokes' top league leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team was short of inspiration and no view of being able to match.
While Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingstone is rising to third only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the captain Calum Spence had to be treated for head injury after something was thrown from the visitors' heads.
Gerrard made eight league changes and helped Ayr reach the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt remained with the 11th and Hearts last week and would have liked the way his regular squad had to beat their opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated in terms of ownership but Livingstone did more with the ball when she had them.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman a chance on Allan McGregor's goal but the centre-half method his chance by hitting the ball clearly.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep free kick to find captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit a clear shot at the back post.
Rangers were in control but there was more hope than belief in them playing in the final game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a smotten chick less than a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless had been beaten but the judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Columbia Court's appeals.
Rangers received two shots for the goal in the first half but were unable to get through to Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly with Lassana Coulibaly's penalty and Ovie Ejaria's injury.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes was against the run of the game, no one can argue that they were not worthy of it just because of their hard work.
However, Rangers method and handling and Jacobs deep play plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was discouraged as he passed to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was a bit of a rock as he changed Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and almost had no immediate impact as the bus driver drove to Morelos but Kelly pulled out a block-wheel.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's carriage could have added to their score in the final minutes but McGregor rose well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could take a penny of the horn.
Rangers boss Glenn Middleton had another request for a smotter's kick after an accident with Jacobs but Thomson rejected the request again.
Almanac: Geiger Measurement Developer
And now a page from Almanac Bore Sul: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in CYFRIF... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of finding and measuring humidity, a development that would eventually lead to the device known as the Geiger Gauge.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger Gauge has also become an important part of popular culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portrayed as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: Is this the world?
Rogers: Geiger's gauge, they're used to find the minerals of the bubble, like granite.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms being released by the vibration in the mines.
Evans: Look, it makes a little noise!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device that got its name from it is still in use.
New cancer detection can teach the immune system to see foreign cells
New cancer detection can teach the immune system to see foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves the collection of cancer stem cells, which are then re-assessed in a laboratory
Then they'll be able to see a protein that's common in many cancers and they'll be re-engineered.
A vaccine test shows promising results in patients and different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw your cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking cancer stem cells, re-testing them in a laboratory so that they can detect a protein called HER2 that is common in several cancers, and then re-regulating the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 causes the development of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and spinal/rectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking stem cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began a Trump-favorite tour wearing a MAGA cap.
She wasn't well
Kanye West was fired from the studio during Saturday Night Live after a dramatic performance in which US President Donald Trump praised and said he would run for the Presidency in 2020.
After performing his third one that night, Ghost Town, wearing the Make America Great Again cap, he rallied against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I'm gonna talk to a white person and they're gonna say, "How can you like Trump, is he racial?
Well, if I was worried about race I would have left America a long time ago, she said.
SNL began the show with a sgetsh starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before almost a Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West managing to be uploaded to social media by digital artist Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was attempting to strike West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been stabbed behind the stage over what he was wearing on his head.
They were throwing me backstage.
They said, "Please go out and get the top of the hill".
They were mocking me!
Then they tell me I'm in a low place, he said, then after the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you want to see the low? " saying that I would put my superman suit on, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Say love.
His comments were echoed at least twice by the SNL audience and cast members were eager to see, Variety reported, while one person told the publication: "The whole studio was completely quiet.
West was added as a late idol to the legendary Ariana Grande, as her former lover the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West approached the confusion to a number by performing I Love it dressed as a Perrier pot.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who remarked: I have one of my favorite characters: THE WRITER FOR WRITER HAD.
But host Karen Hunter found West to be nothing more than a self-made man and that was wonderful.
But I choose PEIDIO by rewarding someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is promoting and revealing ideas that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too, he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper, Snoop Dogg has been given the name Snoop Lion and of course the late musician Prince changed his name to symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.

The defendant is expected to appear in front of Belfast Court of Appeal on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Investigation Service.
The series Game of Thrones Kit Harington kills on a poisonous beast
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO horror fiction series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed off the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean young boys feel they have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that something had gone wrong and questioned how to address the issue of toxic heroism in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who married Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, recently admits that she feels strongly about tackling the problem.
I feel very strongly at the moment - what's gone wrong with the stars?
What have we been teaching men as they grow up about the problem we have now?
Kit O'Rer considers that television is partly responsible for the rise in toxicity and that because of the very toxic characteristics.
And he went on saying, What is wise, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes boys feel they must be a special kind of man?
In my opinion, that's one of the big questions of our time - how are we changing that?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong with young men.
In the interview he admitted that he would not make any other Game of Thrones programmes when the series ends next summer, saying he had scaled up enough on fights and horses.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West about a brother and a filthy, rogue filmmaker.
Recently the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to do from Game of Thrones.
I met a woman on the show, so in a way my family gave me, and my life from now on, she said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's lover and character Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people in the country suffer.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood supplies.
But the number of people living with HIV like this has been reduced almost nothing, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Gender transmission of HIV is a major problem in the LHD community of China.
Homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rampant.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the infection transmission is due to poor sex safety in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a staff member has released Republican parliamentarians' data, killing on dangerous lies and premeditated misconduct
On Saturday, Rep. Maxine Waters denied allegations that a staff member posted information about three Republican Senators to the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being spread by far-right protesters.
"Lies, lies, and more lies", Walters said in a statement to Twitter.
The release included the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was leaked online on Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who has been nominated to the Supreme Court.
The information was released after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Protective websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and they released information from a Waters staff member, the Hill reported.
"This innocent accusation is false and a naked lie", Waters said.
The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and untrue allegations - was not responsible in any way for releasing this information.
This innocent accusation is false and a naked lie.
Waters' statement was quickly condemned online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is a boring excavation", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that she is not in her nature to be a Member of the Congress.
When they are accused of something they have not done, they do not go out in shame.
They're not outstanding.
They do not question the motivation of the hunter.
They must be quiet and quiet.
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' judging of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by judges of appearing angry during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also made his opinion on Twitter.
Tell me if it's true, he lied.
In his statement, Waters said his office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of fraudulent allegations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,  he said  and that they are responsible for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again review - spoofing spying van with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with British origins and to see fit for this revival of the Johnny English comedy parody series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Or should I speak in the poor on how sober we will be the opportunity to export the new nation?
However, the troubled Johnny English has been licensed to ruin everything for the second time - with his name more than indicating that he is a comic character created for movie-goers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, the spokesman for the fireworks, who despite his patriotic claims included a small Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony.
Originally based on the mysterious traveler and man Atkinson played in a Barclaycard commercial, leaving a mess behind.
There are one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved seeing Johnny English go towards a skull wearing a hat and the lips of the rotor punching against his helmet.
Atkinson's dance with physical comedy is not seen, but the humor is vain and oddly unnecessary, especially now that serious films like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of filmmaking.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's unflattering jokes are not as clever and appropriate as Atkinson's quiet jokes in Bean's character.
The contemporary idea is that Great Britain is in big trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a British secret spy network, releasing the identities of all British spies in the field, despite a cryptic cry of duty - an unfortunate and small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final step for a self-righteous and self-absorbed prime minister, who is already suffering from enormous political uncertainty.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all spies have been put at risk and that some will come to her and someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who works as a schoolmaster in some sort of big organization now, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, while English teaches a spy school similar to School of Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reconciles with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is cast.
So Batman and Robin have to get things wrong back at his Majesty's service, coming across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in a hurry to be rocked by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can deal with British computer problems: Jason Vola is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous journey: dressed as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; create a whirlwind while attempting to board the famous Volta ship; and English cause complete disorder while attempting to use a Virtual technique to communicate with the inside of the Volta house
They're doing a really good show about it in the final scene, but despite how fun and uncomfortable, there's a little bit of a feeling of children's television about everything.
Very clear.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes him play fairly well with his talents?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for British people to work for four days a week but be paid for five days
Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical scheme that would mean British people work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party says it wants company owners to save money by pushing artificial intelligence forward for workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would mean that workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would coincide with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country from workers' favor.
A change to a four-day week has been approved by the Labour Unemployment Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight but a four-day week is an ambitious one that is in line with the party's attitude towards the workers' economy's restructuring as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Labour Party promising a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, at the moment the ambition is not endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's party convention to broaden his vision for social inclusion in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from the directors and professors of the public resources companies.
Opposition cell schemes also mean that existing water company shareholders will not be fully refunded as the Labour government could make declarations on the basis of apparent wrongdoing.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on short-term companies and to create an inclusive Ownership Fund to give 10 per cent of company equity to the private sector in the hands of workers, which would receive annual allocations of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say at 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, investigative reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was to be seen more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
I told myself before the hearing, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after this had happened, and when the accusations came forth, I said to me, Art thou able to do this?
He was sure, determined and unwavering.
However, Graham's vote to see is strong.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a terrible charge", he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was completely in love with her", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one could confirm her name.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the World Citizenship Festival and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizenship Festival, an annual musical event with an impressive list of stars participating and a message that is equally impressive: eliminate pollution worldwide.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizenship Festival will see tens of thousands of people crossing the Great Plains in Central Park to celebrate artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as to raise awareness of the festival's main goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Heritage Scheme, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything else valuable to help raise awareness of their goal of getting rid of lockdowns.
But how successful has the World Citizenship Festival been with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a good way to motivate people to change or just another case of "clicktivism" - people feeling they're making a difference by signing up for a free online concert or sending out a gift?
Since 2011, the World Citizenship Festival says it has recorded more than 19 million activities by its supporters, aiming at a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to publish meaningful commitments and policies worth $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first quarter of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and publications that were carrying out operations, with at least $10 billion of them being classified or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and operators committed to helping children reach their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help tackle food shortages in the country after receiving over 47,00 donations from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, stakeholders, local governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social inequality and food shortages a historic milestone", Tracey Ullman, the author of The Power of Nutrition, told a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group said the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with meals, after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website, they asked what makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?
The World Citizenship Festival responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements come together, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the top performing artists at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the LNG for energy to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could use the LNG to block energy from Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's intervention in Syria - specifically, where it acts at the legitimate government's invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to handle energy like they do in Eastern Europe, and Southern Europe", he said according to the report.
And, according to the official, there are ways to get around this.
The United States has the ability, with Lynes, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to provide shelter, to ensure that their goods do not reach the market, he said.
Zinke was greeting the audience at an event being hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group describing itself as the US energy consumer's voice.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were more or less the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure on and replace fuel, he said, noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration tries to increase exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option from the bottom up for consumers in Europe.
In that process Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline plan, which Trump says makes Berlin a threat to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a $11 Billion economic project alone that will double the current capacity to 110 cubic metres.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's core opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion we share the belief that energy cannot be used to put pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. response has been met with a strong response from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Industrial Confederation (BDI), has called on the US to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (GDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be considered a hard-line candidate for the presidency in 2020, said a Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that it would be difficult for ystyried to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered enrolling.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and overthrow our powerful government and that includes a woman at the top", he said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will consider it difficult to run for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried in my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been relentless in speaking out on his nomination for the Supreme Court by Trump and Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a polls poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's constituents do not believe she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters were likely to say that the senator should not stand behind the poll of the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research.
Thirty-two percent supported such an effort.
The pinning pole showed much more support for the attempt from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible attempt and 48 percent opposing.
Other Democratic names who have been confirmed as potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin in the rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, was poisoned in Iraq a year after being shot in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can sympathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the beatings some of our soldiers are returning with", he told a crowd in a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an elephant in the room and said about his son and other former soldiers, they come back differently, they come back more quietly and they come back asking if there is respect for what their soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the armed forces have given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska on charges of domestic violence assault on a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possessing a weapon while in a coma, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the balance of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. launched a friend-of-the-class protest Friday in Washington in support of a politically challenged asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
He said his partner, a gang member, had been charged but U.S. officials denied his request for bail on July 20.
He was kept in the barn in Nhexas.
Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced many asylum seekers in the U.S., were described by the country's tourism supporters as countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum if they were fleeing domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy is  ignoring decades of legislative, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that any application for a lock be judged on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a barrier goes against that principle, said the friend-of-the-court bride.
The tournaments further sparked controversy over the immigrant ban policy that damaged the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and to train the necessary labor.
The Jeff Sessions County Court ordered immigration judges not to give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to individuals who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear of their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in announcing the policy on 11 June.
A shelter was not meant to alleviate all the problems - even the serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
The deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly critical.
"He feels very worried", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who was comforting her sick son in a flea centre in Palu city.
Every minute an ambulance comes and bodies come in.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching their homes, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured in the hospital, which was completely damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake
Some patients, including I Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were resting outside Paul's military hospital, where they were being treated outdoors due to severe back pain.
Tears came to his eyes as he spoke about the earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I got caught up in the wall reviews, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then shut up.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US embassy accuses China of conspiracy with propaganda propaganda
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the US promoting trade benefits between the US and China, the US embassy to China has accused Beijing of using the American propaganda channel to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the addition of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular newspaper - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, accusations that China denies.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election was a new step in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to place ads that promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an escalating trade war that has led to the two countries imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs were early in the trade war designed to target exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump's Democratic Party, experts from the US and China said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China will now confirm that blockade by running propaganda ads in our free slave.
By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
Conversely, in this street-level newspaper stand in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find inconsistent voices and you would not see a real reflection of the diverse ideas that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic path, as the paper is under the auspices of the Chinese Communist Party,  wrote.
He added that  one of China's most prominent newspapers had declined the offer to publish his article, although he did not say which paper.
Analysts Warn Republicans Are Excluding Women Who Are Playing Before the Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh Plains
While a number of liberal Republicans support the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on multiple sexual abuse charges, analysts have warned they will see a response, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions about this have been very high, and the vast majority of Republicans on record already say they want to move forward with the vote.
You can't take these things back", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School at The Hill, said in an article published Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute effort to get an FBI investigation would be enough to silence unhappy voters.
Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget tomorrow or November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior counsel and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
For Gwener, protesters were shouting It's a man's November! as they protested in the Senate as the Republicans tightly controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the evidence of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the Democrats is going to be enormous", Stu Rothenburg, an unknown political analyst, told the news website.
People say they are already enthusiastic; it is true.
But it could increase, especially among urban-rural women and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although not fond of a president, often do not vote.
Even before public evidence described Ford's sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nomination, analyses suggested a strong reaction would be if Republicans went in front of them with the nomination.
"This has developed into a complete fluke for Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled it and the way they have treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities ISA, a group that helps elect Democrats, noted to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided as to who is co-owned following Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more in agreement with Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believe or disagree with Ford's testimony, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
Additionally, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh was likely to have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's campaign, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other suspect, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before a nearby Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him through a liquor store when he was 17.
Ramirez accuses Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Gender Equality Award, of having her genitals destroyed while they were in a party during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
A World Wide Web developer is planning to start a new Internet to build a relationship with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will seek to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new project of technology pioneer Inrupt is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In a select interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee announced that Inrupt's intention was to control the world.
We have to do it now, he said of the company.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional resources.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one driver and I have at the same time.
What's unique about the online personal data store is that it's up to the user exactly who needs to see what kind of information.
The company calls it data-driven personal identification.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring the right resources, processes and skills to help ensure Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform by IBM, developers who have contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own dedicated apps using the resources available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he is not speaking to Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change where their business models are completely wired overnight.
We do not ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide commercial power and ecosystems to help safeguard the accuracy and quality of the new web being created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the internet's ambiguity.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely hopeful about this next week in the history of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victorian Clergyman of the First World War
The only Church of England cleric to win the Victoria Cross as a World War I combatant has been commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
The Under-Army of the Parchaged Bernard Vanny won a prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing he had earned Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two men in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One elder elder, Michael Vann, said it was extremely symbolic that the stone was cast exactly 100 years after the game won the Good Water Prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928 the Under-German Vann led his fatal crossing of the Canal de Saint-Quentin through heavy fog and attacks by field and machine gunners.
He later ran to the dancing line and with the greatest courage led the line forward before heading to a field on his own and landing three o'clock.
The Vann Sub-Corn was killed by a German artilleryman on 4 October 1918 - over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his father's actions were something I could not compare with but that he was very upset.
He had his brother Dr James Vann set a torch after the move, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very proud to be part of the movement and added that the true courage of a warrior is shown by the strong support given by so many people.
MMA fans stood up all night watching Bellator 206, they took Peppa Pink in its place
Imagine this, you've been standing on your feet all night watching Bellator 206 only to be banned from the main show.
The San Jose event featured 13 horns, including a keynote address and was shown live across the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, viewers in the UK were left shocked as the screen changed to Peppa Pinc.
Some were unhappy about staying up all night especially to watch the dawn.
One Twitter supporter described the change to childcare as a kind of bad joke.
"Government regulations said the content was not suitable after 6 a.m. so it had to be changed to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppar motherfucker, yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their timetable so it would include viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about the second announcement, we can make it work", Coker said.
But it is six o'clock in the morning there on the Sabbath, and we cannot keep this until it is our Sabbath, the day of the first day according to their appointed time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they were all unfriendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five horns instead of six - as usual - we tried to give too many fans and it was too long.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt unequal because of his sexuality
Plumber Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he didn't realize until he went to high school that everyone is like me.
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights in order to give people a chance.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less worried about winning the Olympic games.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first programme, Daley said she felt like she was better than everyone else as she grew up because she was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said: "Today, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling different, have given me the power and the strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove himself to everyone, so that his reputation would not be disclosed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist who used her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to abstain from homosexuality.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without the consequences of wanting to give away his wealth to others.
The world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was unexpected.
Oscar winner Daley, who is 20 years older than her, married last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
When someone goes through so much at such a young age he went to his first Olympic Games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of that age who had lived through similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his perspective had changed.
"If you asked for a medal last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
But there is more to life than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son, Robert, has a father named Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father hadn't accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
I can't tell him you're not going to be around to be in the front row,' he said.
I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and he was dead did I know he wasn't an anorexic, he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to be in front of my home crowd at the Olympic Games, it felt no better", she said.
He also inspired his first choice - Proud by Heather Small - who had trained as a pre-Olympic and who still gave him a skin of wit.

Mickelson, who is not at his best on the bench for the Fear Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Fear Cup, but he will have to improve his standard to avoid an unhappy mileage.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the four-head and four-game series.
Rather than being in the middle of the action, as has been so often the case in the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, split his day between being a fan and working on his game in the hope of improving his problems.
The 48-year-old was not a good choice for Le Golf National's draw course, where long-course golf is punishable by round-robin shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in the ninth game on Sunday faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12th game of a single, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely vital.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, although he could do nothing else.
"He understood his role today, turned his back on me and put his arm off my compass and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but then she worked out and then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most games in the Sunday Fear Cup.
It could be the end of a career in the Fear Cup that has never reached the high points of his solo record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk says his presence is an irrelevant boost for the team.
"He's rude, sarcastic, frenzied, likes to make fun of people, he's a great person to be in the team room", he explained.
I think the young players are having fun making fun of it too, this week, it was nice to see.
It contributes much more than just a quarter.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big profits can dissipate quickly
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of individual games in the Fear Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danes had their first game at Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the finish line the advantage was down to a blue field with Europe winning 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
Remember for yourselves that we had a big advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we only lost a blue hole, Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10 to 6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this didn't happen.
You must do your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you've got the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the toss, and that's where we'll be focused.
I've said since the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what he stands for in the end - the best players in the world.
He was pleased with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, added Bjorn: "I would never be proud of this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come first, and that's something completely different to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, you're going to experience yourself extremely well as a golfer.
That's the message you need to give to the players, do your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best too.
Unlike Bjorn, American captains Jim Furyk will want to see players perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk has been on top of both major competitions on the last day, as he was part of the team that won at Brookline before losing to Europe to secure the Championship at Medinah.
"I remember every word of it", he said after being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gave players a boost before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to start as fast as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We're setting our line so and putting the men out as we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of players in this order because I think they will work well all the way", Bjorn said of his choice for the individual games.
The New German Warship has been refloated again
A new German frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but will not be available until at least next year due to poor systems and rising costs, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper referring to a spokesman on the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Lynx in 2014, but problems after delivery have plagued the favour of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships which were seized by the Leningrad Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are said to contain powerful cannons, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles along with some classified technologies, such as radar, sub-black and low-pitched sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - new frogs should be able to be harvested for up to two years away from home ports.
But a continuing delay means that the pioneering warships - which will allow Germany to throw its power over the sea - will be in service by the end of the century, Die Zeit said.
F125 was in the mines last year, after the German fleet refused to commission the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that a ship had been returned to shipbuilders after it had been supplied.
The reasons behind the ship's return were unclear, but German media referred to a number of software and hardware failures that meant the warship was no good if it had to fight.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen-class frigates.
It also became apparent that the ship's over-pressure was significantly impairing its performance and diminishing Lynges' ability to add improvements in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be 7,000 tons twice the size of similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the poor hardware, the price for the entire project - including crew training - is starting to be a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from €2.2 billion initially.
The problems of the new fringes are becoming more important ever given recent warnings that Germany's dirty power is declining.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the committee for the defence of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Lynges were sailing out of ships that could be identified.
The official said the problem had worsened over time, as old ships had been decommissioned without new ships being supplied in place.
It was clear that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frogs could join the Lynges.
The National Trust listens to the lives of mysterious
New research is being done on a regular basis in the Scottish Highlands to try to reveal how insects use land to grow food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the unique mammals' behaviour and will help with future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the least common stump on a least soprano stump along with long-term stumps and water stumps in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in important locations around the site to monitor the activity of the stalls throughout the season.
Volunteers and staff of the NHS will also conduct mobile surveys using hand sensors.
An expert sound analysis of the recordings will find out the number of calls of the species and what species are doing something.
A report and a map of the action will then be produced to create a detailed landscape picture of the behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the Scottish National Trust, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to the species and how they are used by all species.
The information will help to identify the benefits of cannabis management work such as forestry and how to manage forests for crops and other related species.
The popularity of cockroaches in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work which severely affects their jaws and leads to bone loss.
Wind and mud turbines can also be dangerous, along with baby powder and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks by cats.
The brass is not crazy.
But because they are wide at night their ears are more useful to their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use sophisticated eco-location to see objects and obstacles in front of them.
The National Trust of Scotland owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important land and over 76,000 hectares across the country and is very concerned about the risks.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct regular reviews, hearing visits and occasional observations.
The organisation has set up Scotland's first wildlife sanctuary at Threave stop in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's wildlife species.
The station manager David Thompson said the station landscape was perfect for them.
Here in Threave we have a great area for struggles, he said.
We have many old buildings, many old trees and all good things.
But there is much we do not know about entrepreneurship, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what is needed for a man to thrive.
It emphasizes the search for conflicts before any maintenance work is done in buildings as one single fire could destroy a killing range of up to 400 female and young conflicts, potentially killing the entire local population.
It is illegal to kill, harass or destroy or destroy their lives.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Heritage Conservation Trust, has been urging the public to help.
He said: "We have so much to learn about our hysteria and with so many species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo is defending violent charges as lawyers prepare to pursue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of violence against him false signs, saying that people were trying to promote themselves using his name.
Her lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In, she is said to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking to a live Instagram video feed to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports false signs.
I'm not going to be able to do this.
What they said today, fake news said the player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, to the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to pursue Der Spiegel over the allegations, allegations they have called an unacceptable pattern of suspicion in a private matter, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek to challenge a moral disregard for the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights offences in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were asked to return to the player's room, where he tried him out, according to papers received with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga accuses Ronaldo of falling on his lines after the alleged incident and tells her that 99 the song was a good song that was disappointing to the un the song.
The documents accuse Ronaldo of confirming that they had sex, but he agrees.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and that photos had taken her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was afraid of her public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Fans United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer moved to Italian side Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK would regret losing car manufacturers forever
The UK would regret forever if it lost its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car production, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would stop producing temporary cars at its factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
We need a deal, said Mr Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said that a delay at the border could lead to job losses if Brexit is without a deal.
The Burnaston factory - which built the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year and almost 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain were to leave the EU at the end of March construction would stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about the impact of a no-deal exit from the EU on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said they will close their Mini factory in London for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what carmakers say are the risks in the supply chain if Brexit is no deal.
Toyota's production line is run on a timely basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for purpose-built cars.
If the UK left the EU without a deal on 29 March there could be problems at the border, problems the industry says would lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would be unable to keep more than two days of stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so construction would have to be terminated.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU could be carefully designed to avoid those border crossings.
We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity", he told Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of delivery channels that have been very successful.
Toyota could not say how long production would be completed, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and would ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union supporter at the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that once these jobs are gone they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our future EU-relationships.
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with national security adviser Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the battle for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh's chief justice continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible presidential obstruction of justice.
Trump will dismantle the national security treaty, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, which has been a topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the presidency by using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last Monday he went to the White House, saying he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of his female co-defendants, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: "There is no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that it's postponed for another week because of all the other things happening at the top of the court.
But we'll see if I always like to give the latest news to the press.
Some would question that claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace explained why.
Sanders said that dislike for television journalists was not the reason for the lack of coverage, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are being harassed.
He then suggested that the direct link between Trump and the press would increase.
The president conducts more Q&A sessions than any previous president, he said, adding without offering any evidence:We have looked at those numbers.
Sanders said the briefing would continue, but if the press had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the U.S. president, that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks.
Trump often receives questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting officials.
Individual consultations for the task are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed why, making a humorous and intimate appearance at times in front of crowds.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish NHS in response to concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation in the country and to urge them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: During the summer the UK-EU talks on leaving have continued, and decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been intensifying preparations for the possibility of a no-deal situation.
I know this time will be a difficult one for all of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the workings of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and our great desire is for you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Defensive Lineman Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-point loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Rees said in a statement that the injury occurred halfway through the season.
'He came to the side line and some kind of swim there,' said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stressed back leg for further assessment.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details on the type of injury or how bad the injury was yet and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year red cross student, is in his first season with the Tennessee Titans after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before being forced to leave the game, bringing the total to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to provide support for homeless people under new plans by the Turks.
This proposal will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp tax will be given to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to spend up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to support the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target those who earn big salaries.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The additional money will stimulate the Government's intention to tackle people who sleep outside.
The additional contribution to the existing stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-and-let homes - can be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this proposal to cost up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly-built properties in London are bought by residents of outside the UK, and this raises the prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to go to home school.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially the capital - have become unpopular because so many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing to cover a quarter of UK homes.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of dramatic proposed housing reforms, including rental management and ending the conversion of people from housing heb-fa.
He also wants to give more power to congregations to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said I would do my best as prime minister to restore the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means turning our flawed housing market around.
Britain will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it cannot be true that buying homes is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, as it is for UK residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house is far from within reach, and the desire to sleep out on the street remains far too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to be Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is calling for the challenge of reviving the North West club, which is currently in third place in the United Kingdom, three points above the rest of the world.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after Prince St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-side and that's it", Ross told Sportsound, a BBC Scotland programme.
When I was a kid, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden a little bit with my dad, and it's something I've always loved.
That opportunity will only come to me if I manage a club successfully.
Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not afraid to link such strong names in such a large club, and he has rejected previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
My success at the moment will be to see if I can lead this club back to the top flight.
Due to the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the Premier League without a doubt, he said.
It will not be an easy task to get the club there, but I probably would not consider myself successful unless we could get the club back there.
It has been only three years since Ross started his career as manager, having spent time as a substitute manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on one of Hearts' coaching staff.
They were then helped to lift Alloa after they had fallen to the third tier, and converted St Mirren from a lower tier to the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever was during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a bit of a point of contention", he said, recalling taking the steps at Alloa.
I was convinced that being a manager was my true profession, more so than being a player.
It is because I have done right, I have lived a purposeful life out of it, and I have pursued it to the highest.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things to do weekly.
I'm still going through that in terms of stress and work pressure but it feels really good to be in control.
I always wanted to be a manager and since I have realized that, I now feel more satisfied with my life than ever.
Listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, on Scottish Radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a chat is 5.30pm on a Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot summer weather has given a boost to the hard-to-find British pound profits, but has put more pressure on the housing markets.
Bar and restaurant groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but a 4.8 percent decline in dining-house profits, according to figures.
Peter Martin of CGA business consultancy who compiled the figures said: "Because the hot weather has continued, and England have stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern quite similar to that of June in July, where the odds saw an increase of 2.8 percent, but the eating houses suffered more than ever.
After the 1.8 percent drop in the housing market in June, things got worse in July.
Tabernacles and bars selling liquor performed best seeing more growth than houses eating from losses.
The sun also made it difficult for the main parades to focus on selling food, although not as much as those who run dining houses.
It seems that going out for a drink was just what people wanted to do.
Across the barren and tightly controlled bars, there was a 6.6 percent increase in sales of beverages for the month, while there was a three percent decrease in food.
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analysis firm RSM said: "These results show a continuation in the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain key factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that eating household groups still suffer, although a decline of 4.8 percent year on year will certainly be painful as well as ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a bad time for people who run fast food houses that focus on selling food, and a time and a time when more moderate weather in August will provide some of the relief they really need.
In July, sales of food stalls and food stands increased by 2.7 percent, including new ones opened, reflecting the slowdown in new brand introductions.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK food and beverage sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups. They have a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and are a stable benchmark for the industry.
One in five children have secret social media accounts they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Insta pages.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a B account to show parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts - which refer to an Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has highlighted concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a suitable account to show parents, while they also had some private ones.
A mother came across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a child in his teens encouraging others to adjust me.
Research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Higher Education Community (HMC) independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18 year olds have two profiles, half of whom admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It is worrying that so many children in their teens are being tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers cannot find.
Doyle's second choice will be to elect athletes to the Scottish Athletics Board.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an acting director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and the decision chairman Ian Beattie described it as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from the wide range of experiences it has had at international level over the past decade.
"There is a great deal of respect for Eilish across the Scottish athletic community, the UK and the world, and we are sure that Scotland would be a great benefit to have athletics on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm eager to be a voice for athletes and hope I can contribute and help lead the game in Scotland.
The American won the 200 and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of his four other Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a stroke of temporary ischemia.
He tweeted: Today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it took time to determine whether or not he would recover.
It's been a killing but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again and today I'm doing exercise!
Thank you for all the messages of encouragement!
There is a wide range of opinions online about pump advertising that almost compare mothers to babies
A variety of opinions online are due to an advertisement by a near-fatal pump company comparing nutritious mothers with babies being raised.
To mark the launch of what is known as the world's first wearable near-distance pump, the tech goods company Elvie has released a viral ad in music video format to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to celebrities.
Four real mummies dance in a cold, dark shade in it, to a track that contains words like: "I'm proud of myself, but you don't see the presence of me".
The candle goes out: Pump out, pump out, I feed the baby, pump out, pump out, I raise the baby.
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been a hot topic online.
With 77,000 people watching the video and hundreds commenting, it has received a mixed response from viewers, with some saying it does not seriously convey the culture of the dairy industry.
Very poor judgment when using a wire to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them within days of giving birth, wrote one.

Another said: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a pump near to moms who're keeping their babies?
Another added, "A fool who does not understand the world is in danger.
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she saw the song as too much.
This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I had still to eat from the front.
Pumping made me feel just like a duck.
The advert was a little hurtful but I took it for what it was.
This is a great product, wrote one
Another said: This is a fun-filled hobby aimed at pump-up moms (often in the workplace or in the shops) and feels like a warrant.
No praise or criticism of the dairy industry is given to the advertisement.
At the end of the video a group of girls reveal that they have been dancing with the pimps hidden in their arms.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump their breasts feel like they are being bullied.
However, the Elvie pump is completely separate, has no books or tubes and fits tightly inside a nursing chair. This gives girls freedom to move, to hold their baby, and even to go outside while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Executive Director of Mother said: Elvie pump is such a vibrant product that it deserves a clear and profitable launch.
In demonstrating the similarity between a front pump and a rear pump we wanted to highlight the front pump and all the challenges, showing the incredible freedom that comes from the new pump in a meaningful and relevant way.
This is not the first time Elvie's bomb has made the front pages.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on stage with designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Child Abductors Have Been Moving to a Camp on the Texas Border
The number of foster children being held for the purpose of escaping has increased sharply although the numbers crossing the border each month have not changed much. This is partly because the strict rules and policies introduced by the Trump administration make it difficult to place children with guardians.
Traditionally, most of the nurses have been immigrants themselves without a right to be in the country, and they have worried about risking their right to remain in the country as they proceed to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the provision of nurses and other adults in the house would have to be given fish trails, and that the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, chief scientist of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied to unaccompanied minors' homes.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are tenants or members of the same household with tenants live in the country illegally, and a large number of these are foreign criminals.
So we continue to go after those individuals, said Mr. Albence.
To speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the usual rate, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear through a video-conference call, rather than in person, to plead a case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for assistance shall be deported without delay.
According to shelter workers and reports that have appeared from the system in recent months, the longer children stay in the shelter the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent clashes or attempted escape.
Observers say such concerns are exacerbated in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering can be ignored, due to their size.
It was added that moving children to a small town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to chat with friends can worsen the trauma many struggle with.
Syria is telling the troops who have claimed US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately.
In welcoming the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its heightened year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegally fighting terrorism, and will deal with them appropriately.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem said the war on terrorism was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this sacred war until all Syrian regions were cleared of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the trenches of a war-torn country.
In discussing refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were favorable for them to return, and he criticized many Westerners for expressing unresponsive fears that encouraged refugees to stay away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the process for their return, he said.
They have done a very humiliating thing in a political matter.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition ends the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a listening post at the last important rebel battle in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
Under the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the country, where three million people live, was prevented.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had temporary restrictions and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front closely linked to Al-Qaeda, which would lead to their destruction.
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations counterpart hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee that will include government officials and opposition figures to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's job would be to review the current articles of the constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Another Sea
Given that, Mr. Trump could be impeached in 2020 unless, as many liberals hope for sure, an ambition and scandal soon put an end to his presidency.
And that would, without a doubt, be the most dramatic change to leadership ever!
At present, there are no signs that the viewers have grown tired.
Since 2014, the number of hours of daylight saving time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the The Rachel Maddow Show program has outperformed cable television viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a very attractive text for people because we don't understand it", said Neal Baer, host of ABC drama Designated Survivor, "speaking of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the capital's destruction attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said of, Because it makes me laugh, Ms. Scovell told me.
Entertainment is in the middle of the mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the recent stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether families who have immigrated can be brought back together, and the state of the vast world economy.
Only the most qualified viewers have the ability to turn off the television.
And yet, it goes further than being an informed citizen when you realize that you're on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts argue about Bob Woodward's use of the words "heavy background" as he tracks information for his book "Fear, $15,000 shots of Paul Manafort's estranged skin (a tale with too much pride, according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' horrific descriptions of, in, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I personally would never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
Part of what makes you feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night, said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars about the characters of the Trump program being circulated daily in the stories' brains (the N.F.L. fight, praised by Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside my home on the southern slopes of Kauai, but he had swam inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the saddle.
I remember when we were doing all the crazy programs back then and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western destruction", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but the truth about it is they were right.

Out of the money flows into the midterm election race in the House
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania receives a cash flow, thanks to congressional reorganization that means two contenders in the race for the same seat.
The recently reorganized Pittsburg metropolitan area favours the incumbent Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another region in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is slightly more than the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old divisions were unconstitutionally unfair in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th region has been a campaign finance battle between the main party finance branches, the Democratic National Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a contest that received much attention in March in a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Republican had held the seat for more than a decade, and President Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political pundits say the Democrats are ahead.
U.S. considering sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little disapproval from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with former President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017. He had a hotel in Manama until the partners turned the Trump Foundation management team out.
State Department officials decided to recall diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions to refuse to recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
Sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from the US in 2017, which included drug control, economic support and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials urged a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to lead a similar meeting held last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to block migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, thus ending any consideration of sanctioning El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence had been heard to greet the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration is putting on the meeting.
And the three messengers from America returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in vain without any difficult new messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to give details of the argument described by the three American officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to speak about the internal negotiations on condition they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on the condition that he was unknown.
Study of the past
The next major event is likely to be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possibility that Mr Trump has obstructed justice, where substantial evidence is now in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller also discussed that Mr. Trump's campaign was plotting with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face the accountability of that body, and he's preparing to go before voters again, and maybe a jury of wealthy people in the long run.
A lot of uncertainty belongs to that, and I don't suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable- no rivals in Europe.
We all need to make choices on either side of the planet that will impact our efforts.
In 1938 German officials were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of conflict that followed.
The course of history revolves around such formative points, and the journey of democracy is accelerated or accelerated.
Americans face many of these form factoring points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses the National Security Advisor Rod Rosenstein, the man who is controlling Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep waters ever since this paper reported last year, suggesting secretly recording a presidency and declassifying him as unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times report is incorrect.
How will we respond if the investigation the FBI has just asked of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and anonymous evidence?
Finally, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, it will be difficult for democracy.
But I do not think we will fail, because of the lessons I learned in Mecca.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had just occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika display table.
And as part of my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is busy before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, means they are in a good position to qualify from Group G of the European Championship.
A head-on injury meant Graham Dorrans was unable to play this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we could get something and we came out there with a point.
We may have finally won but, overall, a fair game was a fairly more likely outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As for Thursday night, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be difficult because they have a good result in their last game. But, with the strength behind us, I am sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made at the club itself, but there's a good feeling in the place now.
The carp is good and the boys enjoy it terribly; the exercises are good.
Hopefully we can hold on now, forgetting about the last term and succeeding.
Women lose weight because of this fear of retirement holidays
Despite the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few people spoke about it to family members.
About half of individuals in a Nationwide study said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to get that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not give your wishes in advance.
Work with your family counsellor to discuss where and how care is provided, as those choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial adviser: Your financial adviser can also help you think about how to pay those costs.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-added life insurance policy to cover those costs or self-insurance of your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Develop your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Make sure you have healthcare practices so that you appoint a person you trust to supervise your medical care to ensure that professionals comply with your wishes lest you become unable to communicate.
You should also consider counselling for your financial matters.
You would choose a person you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you can.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
It's more about financial matters, who are the doctors?
What are medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Complete that plan.
A man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Dundee, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02.30 BST, as a random act.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, with the death toll likely to rise.
With connections broken, rescue officers have been unable to obtain any information from Donggala forecasting, an area in northern Palu closely adjacent to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been displaced by the devastating earthquake.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Region, at the end of a steep cliff on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a strong outlet stretching over more than 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The suburb, an administrative area under cultivation, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Agriculture and farming are the main drivers of the economy of the Central Sulawesi region, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the country, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Tire Lineage Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Territory in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian subcontinent, with more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya's forecast bus was hit by an earthquake in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and dangerous tsunami.
This time it was not caused by a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Lombok, a remote island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the island's north side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, temporarily leaving thousands of tourists stranded there.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, denied domestic violence reporting and refused arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman confessed to trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone away from her.
Palin is being held in the custody of the Mat-Su Supervision Facility and is being held on a $500 bail, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he claimed to be Jewish, certainly when asked about his whereabouts, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of Class A misconduct, which could result in up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with Class B misconduct, which carries a penalty of a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being argued before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and assaulting a drunk driver in connection with the incident.
Her love claimed that he had put a point on her face.
Sarah Pilan was convicted by a group of ex-servicemen in 2016 after linking her son's threatening behavior to severe PTSD following a period of service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami:millions are killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, an Indonesian island, on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, which lies to the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are shared on social media showing the time of the event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors call for the extreme punishment of the man suspected of carrying out the horrific attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking extreme punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of the horrific New York City attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment the state has not given for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bike lane along the West Main Street in Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bikers who were on their way in October.
To justify the extreme punishment, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov accidentally killed the eight individuals and caused serious physical injuries accidentally, according to the intent to seek extreme punishment warning, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both courts can impose a maximum penalty, according to court documents.
Shortly after the attack, a federal court indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder for fraud, charges typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The prosecutors said the attack required significant planning and planning, describing Saipov's attack as a brutal, violent and corrupt one.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the warning said intentionally.
Five of the victims were tourists from Northern Ireland.
A decade has since passed since the Southern District of New York introduced the extreme penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time extreme punishment was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union's behalf during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the statement.
He also asked for an ISIS banner in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded guilty to 22 counts of fraud.
David Patton, one of the defenders representing Saipov, said they were apparently disappointed with the verdict.
"We believe that the decision to seek extreme punishment rather than accept a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole only extends the trauma of these events to all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the pursuers not to seek extreme punishment.
As a judge says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit debates
Nigel Farage pledged to speak on behalf of the people today during a protest at the Democratic convention.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must feel pressure from MEPs - as one of the EU's top ministers, Theresa May, herself, suggested that she should be responsible for EU-wide discussions.
At the Birmingham rally, Peter Bone, one of the Conservative members of the backbenches, said the UK would be leaving now if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May faces the challenge of re-establishing her highly divided rallies based on pro-Aros Democrats joining another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is having a hard time keeping his Chequers plan in order amid attacks by pro-Brexit, pro-Russian and pro-European Union people.
The coalition has insisted that it will still try to bargain with Brussels despite the pressure - forcing MEPs and Labour members to choose between its pack and its package.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to stop Chequers.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made lord and given the responsibility for the discussions with Brussels.
"If it had been responsible, we would have gone out now", he said.
AS Wellingborough added: I will stand for Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be equal.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that British people have changed their minds and want to remain completely wrong.
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexit member, was also at the event and told the audience: Rwyn say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are not popular with the public, the Opposition is not going to vote in favour of the scheme, it is unpopular with our party and with our active members who are taking to the streets to vote for us in the first place.
Don't go ahead with Chequers and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, he added: Chief ministers keep their posts when they keep their vows.
Mr Farage said in the rally that politicians must feel the pressure if they want to vote on the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's about trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They're trying to prepare for Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let you do that.
In an enthusiastic message, he added: "I want you to make the political class, which is about to prepare for Brexit, feel that pressure.
We are acting on the voice of the people of the country who have secured a victory for us on Brexit and will continue until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, pro-Aros people marched through Birmingham to hold a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of anti-Brexit activists waved Turkish banners after the group launched this weekend.
One Labour Lord, Lord Adoins, made fun of the Conservatives over the safety issues they had met with with the party's app at the opening conference.
"That's why people tell us they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canadian plus plus bargains, for unlimited borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he said.
It's a complete lie.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren seriously about running for president
Elizabeth Warren, a United States Senator, says she will look into running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe says the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular judge of Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP's Republican State Representative, who was co-chairman of the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
There has been a flood of speculation that she could compete against Trump in 2020.
At the event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, she met with voters for the 36th time using the city hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked if she intended to run for president.
Warren said it was time for his daughters to go to Washington to overthrow our glorious government, and that includes a girl on the beach.
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone has been arrested on suspicion of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Simpson, a teenager, at an ET news conference at 11am.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man who is seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead outside the University of the South campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died instantly as a result", Murphy J. Paul, one of the police's top officers, told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend who was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, holding a gun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and was placed in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-6-inch young boy who grew up in Baton Rouge. He had played in 32 games starting 10 of them last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world title after the team order to help him win the front over Sebastian Vettel
It became apparent after Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team arrangement would play a big part in the race.
On the post, Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first hole, allowing Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been essential.
The Mercedes went into a lap pool later coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself and saw the Ferrari driver, dissatisfied, leaving the inside free in danger of being caught to go after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he continued on his home run to try to finish fast and pass Kimi Raikkonen to secure fourth place.
He finally made a hole-in-one on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came in fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and he was a poor man letting me drive.
The team has done a great job of getting one two, Hamilton said.
That's the body language of John the Baptist
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday for refusing to share a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in Northern Virginia, the president did not directly reference the evidence Ford had presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said what was going on in the Senate showed that people were corrupt and evil and false.
The same thing could happen to the blessed thing that has been going on in the last few days in Senedd, when you see the lies, when you see people who are hateful and bad and lying, he said.
When you look at the statements and the documents that are being shared and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I did not.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember his answer... you shared the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, not at all.
I did not share the document.
Well, wait a minute.
We shared the document...Naddo, we didn't", he added, by the senator's side.
Feinstein received the letter containing details of the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was shared in early September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't share his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill said.
She asked me to keep the letter secret and I did as she had asked.
But the governor did not seem to believe him, and he noted during the Saturday night rally: "I tell you something, his body language was very bad.
She may not have, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nomination, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three girls, the president suggested that the Democrats use the claims to their own advantage.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the hatred, the malaise, they don't care who they hate, who they must squeeze on to gain power and control, 'said the president according to Meditate.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made a proper loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game after 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won the previous earlier as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team's score before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to secure their victory.
It was the third time Adam Keefe's men had lost the Elite League this season, a team that had beat Dundee 2-1 unexpectedly in Belfast on Wednesday night.
This was the fourth time the teams had met this season, with the Giants beating the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford assisting as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned to the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide a Cownie-equivalent goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the lead in the first period as he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team re-entered and, once again, Bouchard ensured they had an even score with a powerful goal of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen to put Dundee ahead for the first time in the late second half and secured the victory by scoring five goals halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed to Secure Hundreds of Aircraft Could Fly Off the Underground
An Indonesian air traffic controller is called to the army after he dies ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people takes off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong reversals continue to hit the area and many are falling into disarray in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues having fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old boy, refused to leave his job at the highly centuries-old control tower at Palu airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained there to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a patient from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the ship arrived at Palu.
Hearing the news is awful, he said.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands with the disaster winding agency saying access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong towns is restricted.
The number is likely to continue to rise because many bodies are still under the falls and many bodies have not yet been reached, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have broken Paul, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing a body here every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing small supermarkets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross races to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
The situation is already dire, but it could get much worse.
President Joko Widodo visited Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the movement and transportation.
Are you ready? ' CNN said.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused 550 deaths.
Airplane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after the plane plunged into a lagoon
The airline that was flying a plane that crashed into a lake in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew managed to leave the landing plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen a man who had been traveling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
A local troop rescued the other passengers and crew after a water-cooled plane crashed while attempting to clear Chuuk Island airport.
Officials say seven people have been taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six people were still in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and how it happened.
The United States Airlines and Lines said the plane had crashed into the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had passed over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American traveler, said the plane had taken a very low flight in.
"That's a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to walk through the water to the middle of the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said the plane's crew were upset and shouting, and had suffered minor head injuries.
U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve the waterfront had helped save lives by using a windship to transport people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in plane crashes registered with PNG in the last two decades but none of those included Air Niugini.
A dancer presents a timetable for the night the woman was burned alive
The verdict launched his case on Saturday after a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 was retried.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
The jury outlined how he used cell phone records to create a full picture of the movements of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she had obtained location data from many cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone during the time he had said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday saying he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was a Sanford liar that night, Sanford said he was a liar, because my brother was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis had said she had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted text messages, calls and contact information from Chambers's phone some time after she died.
'He wiped her out of life,' said Hale.
The defender will begin his closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio is challenging the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots, which are political messages and to tackle social issues.
They want to return to those roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a new ton of support in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Nan chasing a couple for dismissal following a text message hiliol
A New York nan chases a couple for discrimination against her and dismisses her after receiving a text message that was tampered with by the mother complaining that she is another black person.
The couple deny being racial, saying the situation is as if someone is seeking a profit.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed to see that the childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"I am a man of God". Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to a man.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt a little nervous, fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their old grandmother, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she was rather expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is chasing the couple for compensation because she was fired, and she is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with the lodging she was initially hired to do, though without a contract.
I want to show them, look, you don't do things like this, he told the Post on Friday, adding that I know this is a case of discrimination.
The couple have confirmed their claims of being racial, saying that ending Maurice's population was the sensible thing to do, as they fear they could not trust her after it was destroyed.
My wife sent him something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racial.
We're not racial people, the husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the care of someone you have treated unfairly, even if it were a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think so.
Comparing the legal case to the situation of someone trying to profit, Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two weeks and she was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to chase someone like that?
That's not the right thing to do, says the investment banker.
Although the legal case was still ongoing, it was a long time before the public opinion judged the couple on social media, judging them for their reasonable behavior.
Paddington publishers fear readers would not agree with the hard-to-speak, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who died shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into someone's shoes who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Now, it's very vague to know what we know about Paddington's extraordinary success.
He said his father, who had been working as a BBC camera man before being inspired to write a children's book by a small-time tenant, would have accepted the idea if his work had been rejected, but added that celebrating 60 years since the books were published was a sad feeling after his death last year.
He said his father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success in a small silence, describing him as a very important member of the family.
"He was a rather quiet man, and was not a proud man", he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of a child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he considers Paddington's success that way.
Although his imaginative creation was work, he always gave Paddington himself credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After her wound, her daughter was admitted to Loius Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say things were very bad, and she didn't expect it to happen", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
I got the call from Nad saying she was going to die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given her to keep her heart beating began to stop and leave her system.
She had died a little before that and now everything was shutting down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not stop crying or crying because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave.
Late Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, was taken on board the plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of her profession.
"No one knew", he said.
I kept my head down, and my tears were pouring down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the vast feeling of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding of it.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning postcards to stop suicides on a bridge
Two girls who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on bridges in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day", she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook and had an infectious disease.
Everyone remembered her for her laughter.
They always said that her smile lit up any room.
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was found dead after committing suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that that will have an impact again.
Ms Davis designed the cards, to let people know that there are people they can go to and talk to, even if they're friends.
Do not sit in silence - you must speak.
Ms Humphreys has been friends with Ms Davis for years, and she lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after he lost his mother.
He never said he felt sad or low or anything like that, he said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in attitude.
It had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children were opening their presents he hadn't made any eye contact with them or anything like that.
He said that his death had been a tremendous shock to them, but they had to pass: he is ripping a hole through my family.
He's cutting us to pieces.
But we all have to carry on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the saddle as the FBI begins investigating
"I was thinking, if we can get something like he was asking for - a limited investigation in terms of time, limited in terms of scope - maybe we can secure some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was breaking down in the middle of a controversial legislative agenda.
Why wasn't Mr. Kavanaugh one of the Republican supporters wanted by the FBI to investigate?
Their timeliness is about time.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been picking up a phone call to Senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to reach a decision to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee populations decline under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees fleeing to South Korea has declined since Jim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug said, referring to data from the southern united administration, that there were 1,127 cases of flight last year - an increase compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the stricter processes to control the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates of human traffickers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which is the longest border with North Korea and the country it is easier to cross than the heavily protected border area between the two Koreas.
China refers to those who flee as illegal refugees rather than refugees, and often forces them back into their own country.
The North-South relationship - which is still technically at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled de-nuclear talks.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a fresh discussion about working towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imposed U.S. sanctions over the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not be the first to dismiss ourselves", Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "freak", saying he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh uncomfortable, saying that he was unfit, due to the nature of his character, to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribeca Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had acted like that, I'm sure they would have called her a freak", Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in denouncing allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both in their teens.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost crying and tearing at times as his family discussed his time in high school.
He also specifically criticized the Democrats on the committee, saying that the allegations against him were destroying his good name in a coordinated and counter-productive manner and that were orchestrated by liberal activists who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because his testimony showed he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think it shows that he is incompetent with those statements and the way Clinton supporters have been shunned by the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was surprised when asked if she would seek confirmation, and who would win the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court or the court he's on at the moment", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that she as a Democrat was worried about possible cases of Kavanaugh v. the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse specific Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time to bring a lawless man to court and expect us to say, 'Is that okay?' " said Pelosi.
And women must speak of the matter.
The words of righteousness are months, and years of wickedness; and they shall not be removed without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
And before that, I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, and she said that she cries when she's angry, but she's developed a technique and so, when she gets angry and starts crying, she'll tell the person who's talking to her, "You think I meant to cry sad because I'm crying".
I'm ready.
And then I'll carry on.
And I thought that was great.
Tears are allowed to express themselves in part because they are, in fact, misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of an early job, in an office where men were the most, and I cried out with a voice beyond words, is that the older woman in me grasped the faith of my father - a golden ruler who always dreaded me - and she made my feet fall down the stairs.
Never let them see you cry, he told me.
They don't know you're a gangster.
They will think you are sad and rejoice because you have been saved.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a car accident outside of marriage on a street named Monkey Business and withdrawn from racing, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not think about running for the office of president herself.
"I hadn't really thought about the decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing needed was one more.
A man called us Iron Iron and Seven Corraghs.
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind her on fundraising, so she vowed not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a futile battle.
She noticed that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When she announced her intention not to launch a formal campaign, her feelings became too strong - thanks to the people who supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than representatives, and anger over gender bias - she began to cry.
"You would think my nerves were broken", Ms. Schroeder said of the way the nurse reacted to her.
You would have thought Kleenex was my physical mentor.
I remember thinking, 'What will they put on my grave stone?'
Did she cry?
How can a US-China trade war be in favor of Beijing
The first waves of the trade war between the US and China were enough to warn someone, and while the war is not over, a rift between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting the value of $200 billion (£150 billion) of items, taxing, for all intents and purposes, half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has paid back the pound every time and, most recently, has imposed five to ten percent tariffs on $600 billion of American goods.
China has promised to match US efforts and the world's only one largest economy is likely to collapse soon.
Getting Washington to give up would mean ignoring the demands, but publicly suggesting the US would bring too much shame on Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing can go beyond a very tight compass, U.S. trade war pressure could support China in a positive way in the longer term by ensuring that the two economies are less dependent on each other.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for an economic panic to start in either country is actually far more dangerous than previously recognized by viewers", said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused liaison researcher at the Center for a New American Security, who is open to debate.
Syria 'ready' for accepting asylum seekers back, said Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is willing to accept voluntary asylum seekers back and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by seven years of war.
Welcoming the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure, thanks to the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is working hard to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to normalcy.
The conditions are now right for the return of asylum seekers to the country after having to flee terrorism and the harmful economic measures that have threatened their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not receive conditional or helpful support from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Cup of Fear in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team UDA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The USA have lost six times in a row on European soil, and have not won a European Cup of Fear since 1993.
Europe managed to secure a victory as the team of Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Denmark, reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a difficult tournament, but when the U.S. star's ball fell in the water on the 16th par-3 hole he had to pass the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the Italian golfer, had progressed through the round robin, becoming the first player from 1 to 4 to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the youngest player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top scorer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter who was playing more likely in his last Fear Cup.
And playing in his eighth Fear Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players ever in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not the one to cry normally, but I can't help that today.
She's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for my kindness to me and for giving his faith in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
The team is important, and I'm proud that I was able to help", Garcia said through his tears after Europe won.
The bat was passed to fellow US golfer John Ram and was bowled by US golfer Tiger Woods, 2&1 in the singles match on Sunday.
"I was so proud to beat Tiger Woods because I grew up watching him play golf", says Rahm, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four matches in France, meaning his current record in the FA Cup is 13-21-3.
And that's a strange stance for one of the greatest players ever, having won 14 championships in his career, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, Team USA had struggled throughout the weekend to find a clear path.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the boys here, they're going to fight hard.
We had put pressure on Europe in the morning.
We fought.
You must give a hug to Thomas.
He's a captain without a second.
All 12 players had played very well.
I want to work with the PGA of America and the Committee on the World Cup.
I love 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
You must lift a cap for them.
They played better than us".
The Worst News on the Red Plains: Counting has dropped in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report shows an overall decline in Red Plains' supply for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, sloping areas of slopes appear in parts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier jobs - suggesting that the shrinkage is decreasing.
The Red Plains plain extends about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee's posts.
Pockets of it are about 10 miles offshore from Hillsborough County, but in fewer locations than last week.
The Red Plain was also seen in Pasco County.
Canolic crushing on land and sea in Pinellas County has appeared in the past week, low to high crushing on sea from Hillsborough County, unconscious crushing on land and sea from Sarasota County, unconscious crushing on land and sea from Charlotte County, unconscious crushing on land and sea from Lee County, and low to high crushing on Collier County.
Reports of responsive pain continue to appear in the works of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
There has been no reported case of resurgent pain in Northwest Florida over the past week.
