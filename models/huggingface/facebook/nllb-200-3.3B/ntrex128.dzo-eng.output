John Edwards: Language Arts for the Commonwealth
Scotland's independent schools continued to set a record for academic performance in 2018, with academic results improving, thanks to strong support from the sports, arts, and community sectors.
Scotland has over 30,000 students, and their schools are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Association, which focuses on providing quality services to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher education and life-long careers, and to become international citizens.
We are a community of scholars who can formulate and apply the principles, and modern languages seem to be the primary subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head".
If you speak to a man in his own language, he will understand you; but if you do not speak to him in his own language, he will not understand you.
It's a reminder that we can't use England alone to build our relationships with other countries.
However, the language test has the highest pass rate among all independent schools.
68% of foreign language learners scored above average.
Data from 74 Scottish Independent Schools Association schools showed that 72% of students achieved a grade of A+ in Chinese, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are also showing signs of support for foreign languages, a skill that is needed by future students and young people.
Languages are now offered as elective subjects in the liberal arts and other liberal arts, as opposed to the sciences, engineering, and mathematics.
In a 2014 study by the UK Department for Work and Skills, 17% of job vacancies were due to language skills deficiencies.
So, language skills are becoming more and more important for young people to prepare for the future jobs.
Language skills are a common requirement in the international world, as there are many job opportunities that require language skills.
No matter what profession you choose in life, knowing a second language can be of great benefit in the future.
If they can communicate directly with foreigners, multilinguals will naturally excel in competitions.
According to the 2013 Yukon Census, of the 4,000 Yukoners, 75% were unable to communicate in any foreign language, while only 15% were fluent in French.
That's why it's so important to encourage children to learn languages today.
Multilingualism, especially in emerging economies, has a positive impact on children's employment.
In Scotland, schools have different languages for teaching.
Some schools focus on the older languages, while others focus on the UK in 2020, with the most important languages being Chinese and Japanese.
Depending on your child's interests, the language of choice in the independent schools is also the language of choice for the teachers.
The learning environment in Scottish independent schools also focuses on giving children important skills for their future.
In the globalized world, languages will be important for the future of the country, and this must be acknowledged in education.
So modern languages should be considered as a kind of international communication.
Free schools will continue to provide choice, choice and quality to Scotland's young people.
Do it this way.

North Korea says that without trust, no one will be able to withdraw troops from any side.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Friday that it would not be willing to keep nuclear weapons in such a situation, citing the uncertainty caused by the United Nations sanctions.
Last year, at the ROK Summit, North Korea said it had done "good" by conducting nuclear tests, destroying test sites, and promising to develop nuclear weapons and equipment.
There was no confirmation of his statements by any means from the United States.
We cannot trust the United States without trusting our national security, and we will not be the first to fall in this situation.
North Korea has repeatedly pledged to denuclearize, according to Rhee, citing the UN.
In his post, Lee referred to the June 12 agreement between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US Secretary of State Donald Trump in Singapore, where Kim pledged to disarmament and Trump pledged to help secure North Korea.
North Korea has officially declared the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has also called for Pyongyang to denuclearize.
Washington also refused to listen to North Korean censors.
The United States has repeatedly said that it must first eliminate nuclear weapons, and has also increased sanctions, and has refused to end the Korean War, according to Rhee.
If we are unable to hear what they are saying, we are unable to understand what they are saying.
The disadvantage is that continuous selection can be unreliable.
RAI said last week that Yueng officials had not commented on Kim Jong-un's plans for a second summit.
The minister said that Kim Jong-un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held three summits in the past five months. The issue of denuclearization was not only with the United States but also with South Korea.
Raye's comments were different from those of Lo Yong, who said that the UN could not allow North Korea to make Kim Jong Un's suicide a target of the corrupt government.
At the UN, Trump has said that while he will destroy North Korea, he will also agree to eliminate North Korea's nuclear program, and he has praised the sanctions, saying that they must be maintained until the weapons are eliminated.
The fact that he was not able to talk about it for two years, three years, or five months, doesn't matter.
China and Russia have been unable to agree on a permanent member of the UN Security Council because of the perceived need to recognize Beijing.

At Harvard, students are taught about the benefits of vacation.
A new classroom at Harvard University has been developed that will allow students to sleep more than usual, and to study more without sleeping.
The university is often cited as the first university in the world to have its own administration, and is not the only one.
Charles S. Sziller, MD, of the Harvard Medical School, created the course, which is said to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the class came after a sleepy-eyed student explained that he had a learning disability.
And afterwards came the second to me, and said, Why hast thou done this to me, in the end of the year?
"I'm surprised", she said, "that no one has ever told anyone about your dream".
The classroom was a time-honored place, and students were taught about the importance of sleep, education, and life in general.
Paul Sheraya, a psychologist and the director of the Habbitas Medical School, said the decision to start the class was made after noticing that the students were not well for a week.
The first class of these is the interactive workflow.
In one group, students in a room with coffee, toilet paper, computers, and books discussed the effects of caffeine, the dangers of cigarettes, the dangers of exercise, and the importance of getting to bed on time.
In each group, participants who were sleep deprived were found to be at higher risk of heart disease, stroke, heart disease, and cancer.
Interactive images on the site map make participants think about their daily activities.
This tells us that students can't change their behavior instantly.
But just as we have the right to know the harm that our silence can cause to the body, they have the right to know about it".
The practice of sleeping with strangers has become a very popular practice, and he says that modern technology and the pressures on students are causing them to have insomnia.
He said that getting quality sleep is the secret to reducing anxiety and depression in students, and that lack of sleep can cause the brain to become overworked, which can lead to excessive physical exertion.
Raymond, a 19-year-old from California, was studying chemistry and biochemistry in his last year at Harvard, and it helped his professor, Peter Szeller, to organize the program.
He says the event opened his eyes and inspired him to spread the campaign throughout the region.
We hope to encourage students with a master's degree to study this program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Fessler warned that students would have to wear nighttime headphones to fall asleep and wake up, and that the green light from technology and LED lights would disturb sleep and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Gerard's loss to Manchester
At Levering Eston, he lost 1-0 to Dolmen side Steven Gerrard, and had to be re-adjusted.

Alfredo Morelos was considered for a penalty kick for facing Esteban Lozès in the 45th minute, but the referee denied the Columbia appeal.
Only two shots were possible from the half-court, but the former Liverpool goalkeeper Liam Kelley was given the head start by Lassan Kavalli and the shot was given to Obi Azaria.
Levi's 34 Stars initially seemed to be a game-changer, but everyone's efforts seemed to be worth it.
Again, the surface of the lens is not aligned with Jacob's deep set.
The Declan Gallagher goal gave Scott Robinson the lead, but Scott Arfield was unable to respond and instead chose Mann to finish the game.
In the second half, Gerard's quick play of the substitution of Ryan Kent for Cale, Morelos's ability, but also his ability to run to the line, was blocked.
However, the Liffey and Halcytons of Livingston, along with the long-distance footpaths, continued to attract tourists as a source of entertainment.
Holt's side managed to get the lead to the final level, but McGregor's side gave Jacob a negative pass before he headed to the corner of the ice.
Grant claimed that Strayton had been reassigned to the role of Rangers, but he did not accept the promotion of Thompson as punishment for his disagreement with Jacob.

The vaccine has shown promising results in patients with metastatic cancer.
A woman was vaccinated and her cancer was cured after 18 months of identifying the abnormal cells of her immune system.
The idea is to remove the cancer cells from the patient, transform them in the laboratory, and then re-inject them with the protein that causes cancer, called RR2, which is ubiquitous in cancer.
Professor J. Barzob Azka, of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that our vaccine is a success.
Several types of cancer can be caused by the R2 gene, including ovarian, testicular, colorectal, and prostate cancers, according to Prof. Dr. Joseph Osakie.
A similar system could be used to remove cancer cells from the body and target cancer cells, and could also be used to treat hypertension.
