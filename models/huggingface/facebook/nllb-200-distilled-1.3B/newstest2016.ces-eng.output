On the 911 call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend.
During a phone call to the emergency line in a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and needed them to come to their home.
Lamb determined that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contacts to the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on white stationery: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could give it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me", reads the letter, which authorities say was signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot his favorite professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard gunshots at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to figure out what Lamb's motives were.
Details released by state investigators and students and staff who knew him have combined to paint a picture of a talented but likely troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations to problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also appeared agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously requested a medical leave from Delta State University, citing some sort of problem.
And he's only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes to the university's staffing meant that the PhD that Lamb had been working hard on would not guarantee him an automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge stated that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb was obviously troubled by something".
Lamb won't answer those questions anymore.
After he left campus, police intercepted his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state line back into Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot in the backyard of his home about a mile from his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed Washington State Coroner Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000 in 2009, teaching geography and education classes.
He got his doctorate in education in the spring.
A longtime friend of Lamb's described him as a smart, charismatic, and witty man.
Carla Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older guy who taught her how to play guitar for a few years.
He was a pretty heartbreaker back then.
All the girls' hearts burned as soon as he showed up", says Hairston, now 40, who lives in a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were reportedly dating for a while.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house that was next to the Gautier River Arm.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they separated 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19.
"She was devastated", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but he knew from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the Summer Festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat as Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for the countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple", he said.
We were just fondling each other and taping each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the murdered professor, was leading a first-year seminar specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boys' Club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, approximately 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight memorial service.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", says LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed the report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this story.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a 911 call after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims it will not hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the manufacturer of children's toys and products says it will give current and seasonal employees the chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting this month, and will add staff during October through December.
With the holidays months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help with stores and sales, shipping and delivery.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized the seat next to me was empty and I realized Princess Diana was going to be sitting there", he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time".
The movie starts and I realize I'm on the verge of what you might call a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", is a documentary about "Back to the Future", featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really, for me, arguably the best travel documentary ever made".
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN chief reiterated his urgent call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from the five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that divisions within the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers had 'made the situation insoluble'.
The five permanent members were called upon to show the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching the Iran nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
Eight election numbers that show Donald Trump in a real light.
Some have tried to label him as a man who changes his mind often.
The others waved their hands over it like it was a bad joke.
And some are preparing to implode.
But as much as some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump off the top of the election, they're failing (so far).
10 of the last 11 national polls show Donald Trump leading by a double-digit number, and some people are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul's chances of being nominated.
Of course, it's only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that during this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership paved the way for Herman Cain's rise, ultimately none of them winning a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth realize Trump's will to endure and start to unload their dollars on the grid in order to topple him.
Here are some recent polling figures that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's approval rating has been turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of it.
And these numbers are holding in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac University poll last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "outraged" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest to enthusiasm level?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "upset" if corporate favorite Jeb Bush were to run.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as the problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his arrogance and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to believe that a real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to a Monday ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number holds true for the Iowa State Senate Club, which is number one in the entire country, where 52 percent of Republicans think they have the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he lacks the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who was most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
This time last term, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the race against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet it appears that a number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll from early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always win a majority of the vote.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14, Walker by 15, Jeb Bush by 19, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Chris by 33 points each.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
Ben Carson would have a 19-point lead over the dealer in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump supporters say they've already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump voters say they won't change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change, and no one can really say they'll never change their mind.
46 percent say they're keeping the back door open for change between candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration.
Even after Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violents" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration still holds the key and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's arrogance will distract key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
It seems as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now getting about half the support of Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "displeased" and 21 percent are "hell-bent".
The House has supported a larger share of the state's coal tax.
The Czech Republic will get more than 400 million.
The House of Representatives supported at first reading the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of fees received from surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised the deputies that they would get extra money from both the state treasury and the municipalities' budgets.
The bill was criticised by opposition MPs who feared that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act at first reading, which among other things means that the state should receive a larger share of the revenue from the fees for surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also changes the way the remuneration for the minerals that companies extract is calculated.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
The government claims that the tax is to have a neutral impact on the revenue of the local budgets, as it is to be higher.
In the year before last, the municipalities received about CZK 450 million and the state budget CZK 150 million from the fees.
The municipality's coal production cost about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the compensation from the permitted production areas to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall remain fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the deputies that the municipalities will get annually instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but by government regulation.
The compensation shall be recalculated as a factor of the quantity of ore extracted and the rate for each type of ore.
According to the Government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government regulation may not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, there is no tax in this case, as the State charges the mineral, which is state property.
The fees are paid only to the municipalities whose territory is affected by the extraction.
In the case of deep-level mining, three-quarters of the coal goes to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will apply to the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money the State collects on mining fees will be assigned to a specific purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair mining damage or to provide a mine rescue service.
The bill was criticized by opposition lawmakers who claimed it would harm mining-affected communities and counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to get the finance minister to improve his budget", said David Kádner (Úsvit), elected in the Ústeck region.
The increase in unemployment in Mostec was warned by KSČM MP Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government to be finalized.
The explanatory statement states that the mining companies claim that the increase in fees will not affect coal prices because more than 90% of the prices are long-term contracts.
The main consumers such as power plants or boilers should therefore not feel the price increase.
'On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating costs, which would mainly mean a reduction in the number of employees,' the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in fees is sustainable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and especially the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the revenues for the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak Army's bottom should not take effect until after 2020.
According to him, the limits on ČSA should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
The cheerleader will lead the Czechs to the top of the standings, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech players will appear on the board for Thursday's Davis Cup draw in India, and this time, each of them will likely interfere in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratilit plans to distribute the load to the entire quartet in view of the difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid, so tough matches can be expected that can last up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out by weather.
And according to what it looks like, he said he's back at today's Czech national team practice at the Raja Kumar Khanna Centre.
With the number one team and world number 40 Jerzy Vesely counting for Friday and Sunday's doubleheader.
In the second position, Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are probably rolling.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
I'm a little slow on my feet, but I can't say yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech squad should be the participation of Stepanek in Saturday's four-game series.
It's just a question of who stands up to a seasoned jerk who's 18-4 in the Davis Cup.
It's probably not going to be fun.
There are still options with Rosoł or Adam Pavlas.
"I really don't know who it's going to be with or what it's going to look like", he said back.
It's a two-game decision.
The alternative is Pavlasek, with Vesely surprised in the first round by a win in the double over the Australians.
"He's a good man", said the Returner.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to do the same performance I did there from the second set.
"I'm happy with the experience and I'd like to make a point", said Pavlasek.
The hosts are two games behind Yuki Bhambri (ATP 125), who won last week's Challenger in Shanghai, beating the third and fourth-ranked players.
The number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers and our guys have experience on the ATP Tour, but we've seen a lot of times that the Davis Cup standings don't decide.
"It's the moment's shape, the weather", said the Returning.
Friday's opening two games start at 6:30 a.m. and may be delayed due to weather.
The weather forecast says it's going to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it may be played under artificial lighting.
They've already lit it up and it's got, like, 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be played out under the lights", said the Returning.
Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut on Prime Minister's Questions.
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's PMQ debut has been eagerly awaited.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut on Prime Minister's Questions later today, and for the first time will be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely watched by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he called for "less drama and more facts".
He also said he could skip a few sessions to leave with his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, coming after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech at the TUC annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and has been the focus of several front page stories.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would recognise "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences at work are also "fading" after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government's benefit cap.
Mr Corbyl told the TUC conference that the Labour Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a benefit cap.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the Shadow Secretary for Work and Pensions, said the party was "very clearly" opposed to the government's plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The leader of the Labour Party, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims to have gotten ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North says PMQs are too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "quick answers" and "toothed trade", promising instead to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he's not attending  like when Mr Cameron goes abroad.
He also gave up the idea of having other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he was said to have discussed the whole matter with Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with the PMQ, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their standing amongst other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Focenie in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound rises as UK wages accelerate
The pound jumped the following dates and showed a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led upwards by SABMiller's bid target.
Between May and June, GB's profits, including bonuses, were up 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest rate since 2009 and it looked like the rate increases were approaching.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share, having jumped 20% after receiving a bid approach from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% on encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to pick up again.
Glencore stock is up 5% after the mining giant said it was up $2.5 billion through a co-location as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest drop in the index, falling 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the company to "sale".
JD Sports is up 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in mid-year earnings before tax of £46.6m.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports' chief executive, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more buying power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs at his firm, he says.
The cost could affect JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague marshmallow are cheering.
The controversial building has been stopped.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
A hundred people protested in front of the Prague office, and a petition was created.
The Magistrate's decision stated that there had been a breach of the Building Act because not all the elements of the territorial decision had been complied with.
'The decision on the site in question does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the shape of the building described in a sufficiently clear and comprehensible manner, the definition of the area affected by the construction', the decision states.
The Magistrate also considers it illegal that some of the documents for the decision were issued to the original dossier, but that it has been changed.
For example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
However, the case-file shows that the landlord only agreed to the planning documentation, not to the construction on his land, the Building Code Department says.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetta, of the investment firm, the Building Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the higher authority, the Ministry of Local Development, that the deadline for initiating the review had already expired.
Either way, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions involved", Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which is nicknamed marshmallow because of the supposedly designed facade color, is stirring up strong emotions in Prague.
In the city center, hundreds of people have gathered in the past to protest the construction.
The association and the residents of the nearby houses are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the unsuitability of the building for the historic center of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Anežský Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which included a glazed facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monuments Institute (NMU) and the permission of Prague monuments was revoked in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investimenti with the windows in the shape of faces but the NPA and the local authorities approved and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects criticism from opponents, saying he never expected a pink facade, which gave the project the nickname of pink-white sugarcane.
A Czech politician drove the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he took three Syrian refugees into the car with his crew, who he said wanted to walk about half a kilometer.
He said that it was not a crime in Hungary at the time, he told People's newspaper.
We knew law enforcement would not punish such behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and taken to Szeged, where we were held in detention.
The politician ended up spending nine hours in the cell.
The police were said to be polite, but communication was hampered because they did not speak English well.
But he said that prison was sad.
For example, our cell, about ten by ten feet [3.4 by 4 m], was packed with 15 Syrian refugees.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
The next day, these people were locked up, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.

Metcash launches a rural campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA business from Aldi's onslaught in South and Western Australia.
Metcash launches a rural campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are joining with brands such as Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream parlor offering tastings in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29th, when the food, liquor and hardware retailer celebrates its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA's business footprint and generate higher turnover than Metcash IGA's network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - over 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores, which have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that retail IGA could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in Western Australia over the next year, generating sales of USD 500 and USD 600 million in each market.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash's fixed price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax earnings, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern States, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks Metcash food sales will drop 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, said that Melbourne's business lunches could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglass's comment.
But it's known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and revenues from the Metcash grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retail stores, have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational developments of a speculative shift as sales and earnings are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have gone on the offensive, investing more than $150 million a year to match Coles and Woolworths counter prices on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and novelty from privateers.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that price matching and store closure programs are catching up and he hopes wholesale will return to core profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves the credit for his behavior rather than the criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a casualty in the recent uproar over his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo often referred to as the "Special Ks", attracted unwelcome attention through an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifier in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then stated, "Wawrinka should have given one to Kyrgios and I should have given him one too".
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after his cramp was overcome by a possible defeat by Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis was a staunch defender of Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a place in the second two-legged tie behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"I thought quite intensely that in my opinion Thanasi was a little bit involved in the whole thing", says Healy.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost to a cramp in the US, but he's not the first player to vent his anger on his rocket out of frustration with himself.
But he's really handled himself very well because he's been exposed to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so forth, so I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little rough.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits in very well with the team and so on, he's never had any problems with the other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in amazing shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to skip Kyrgios for an important match starting on Friday, stating that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but he supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term stable.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not on all the controversy that has been created around him", says Healy.
And I think Nick's been climbing very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, he's rising fast in the public eye, he's made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the sun when he can think about it, I think is the best solution for the team and also for him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the declaration of a state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those attempting to cross it illegally in a bid to stem the influx of migrants.
Chaos reigned at the border as hundreds of migrants piled up in no-man's-land and Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those who are stranded for an unknown amount of time on the land between two states stand with those who are fleeing violence in their home countries, building tents and settling down.
But there are frustrations.
When a helicopter flies overhead, migrants shout "Open the borders!" and insult the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just a direct injury.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries", says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border comes a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in Italy and Greece, and spoke of hopes of reaching an eventual agreement next month or by the end of the year that would see EU nations take in more than 120,000 additional refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called for a special EU summit next week to discuss the continent's refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country as the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to pull the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major hotspot and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants seeking a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries including Germany.
New laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now criminalize breaking the 4-meter fence the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provide longer prison terms for those who smuggle refugees illegally.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: illegally crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 already in the country.
They broke through by breaking the fence and are now in police custody charged with offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered in barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at Roszke, chaos ensued as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal processing container and crowded the area.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders is cut in half in the national poll.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race nationwide, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent of the Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, is gaining the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
With more than five months before the main race, the most democratic voters say it's too early to say which candidate they'll support.
But Clinton's backers are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained a few.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and is easing, but her lead is narrowing.
Her male support has dropped dramatically, and Sanders is down by just five points.
Clinton's lead over the under-50s in the Democratic primary has evaporated and they're now tied with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to her older constituents.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is down only five points in that group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters in every state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her simply because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It's probably no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are especially excited about her.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The next thing is to cite the great possibility of choice and agreement on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential bid, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to run - and a third think he shouldn't.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice was Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half named Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead will expand from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely candidate is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve the problems to a greater chance of being elected.
As with last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate has emerged as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads the three in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think so.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as aligned with their ideological views.
By all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continue, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't affected their overall view of her at all.
But among the American public, it's a whole different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are.
Public opinion on the issue was divided as early as March, shortly after the issue was revealed.
Most Americans say that this email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than six out of 10 say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party voters, the issue remains a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But Clinton and Trump both have good leadership grades.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush did best in honesty.
Sanders is seen as more honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't have an opinion about him.
The margin of error in the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national election.
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll.
Two candidates account for half the voters in the latest poll, and the rest are getting their support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump overwhelmingly, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot up from 6 to 23 percent in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson did well across demographics, knocking out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is trailing, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is on a tear from 10% support to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all tied for third with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the most recent poll is plus or minus 6%, and it was taken in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improved to 19% support among Republicans versus Trump's 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump is way ahead of Carson.
In the wake of Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to blind-shoot a retired neurosurgeon, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump declared last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five fraternity members charged in the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during a fraternity weight-loss ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital late, contributing to his death, police said.
Officers report he was blindfolded, had a backpack full of sand weighing a total of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the finish line across an icy field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches and then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi members did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they took the time to change into Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's state president, to ask for his advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically put the welfare of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's life", Chief Wagner said.
He was unable to be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with a blunt object in the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated by overwork in fraternities, and at least one student has died of overwork every year since 1970", writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
The fraternity and its members must be held accountable and this step is important from the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to not only arrest the people involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well", Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity severed its relationship with the local chapters.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates.
Rate hikes will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna take.
For economics specifically, it offers a small originator's story about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, determinative of how the economy and financial assets will respond.
That's why Fed officials have been so emphatic that investors should not be focused on when the rate hikes will start, but rather on the trajectory of how long the normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market participants can be assured that all the noise about the speed increase may be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual return to more normal, but still low, U.S. interest rates to produce the seismic shock that many might fear.
That means there's going to be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how some sectors of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in the last month or so, the expected rate hike may make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect won't be as dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for stocks to stop trading again 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after a Fed increase.
More specifically, the market is often the most - about 14 percent - flat in the last 35 years, rising rates in 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron's.
Deutsche said that the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the rate-rising cycle and returns start to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often help.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Most remarkable is that gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history when the Fed raises rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal annual GDP growth been below 4.5 percent.
Although it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to hold, with it at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports the Atlanta Fed.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
Market participants have been gearing up for the Fed's growth all year, and all eyes are on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% chance.
"In our study since 1950, all upward cycles so far have been in a super-cycle of upward leverage with GDP covering the peaks of the early recession very quickly after the beginning of the recovery", the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we're now at 74 months and still going.
The fixed yield was also volatile as the market expects rate increases and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable on bonds than stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to reverse as soon as the first up/down cycle occurs.
At the end of the upside cycle, bond yields fall immediately", Deutsche said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rate increase will bring the yields between long and short-dated bonds closer together, thus smoothing the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this climate, although "we are still careful about straining yields", said Kathy Jones, a firm fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adjusting to expectations of Fed policy.
"Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are few signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spread has widened and volatility has increased - all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates and local products becoming more attractive.
The multinationals with a lot of debt will do worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the 'quality' of stocks tends to outperform within three months of an initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed firms with weak balance sheets in each rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
The companies with high returns on capital, as well as those with low volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become a big problem.
The companies with the highest floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond the pure action game, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers may also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have differing opinions on how long this will last.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the station for "stealing"
It is considered that it is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they're just cheating the British.
My colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not the original idea either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, says a leading MP, and is building up fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasting is not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public service broadcaster appeared to be "robbed" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - hate to use the word 'stupid' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM", he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that come to mind, where you're actually just copying what we already have on the market", said Mr Bingham.
The BBC's director general rejected the accusations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I could never learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and make music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important", he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that we now need to work harder to engage audiences than before because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production to come under fire for trampling on commercial competitors during the Culture, Media and Sport broadcast and get a hearing by the committee.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, a music talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
You see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not unusually different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a way that is typical of the BBC".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit out of its own barn" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending royalties on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at their slowest pace since August and Black Friday could be to blame .
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Online sales were boosted three years ago by mobile shopping.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could be a reason to slow down spending.
For more than a decade, online shopping has been on the rise, transforming many of Britain's main streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of a stabilisation in online sales, with new figures showing a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 percent year-on-year.
Experts say there are signs of a stabilization in online sales, with new figures showing a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates of past years and go back to 2000, it has always been rationalized over time", says Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to shop in different contexts, like on the couch.
But now it's kind of stagnating, and that's why it seems to be fading.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from America, is cited as one reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers may be reluctant to shop before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times as many shoppers as average turned to their computers to make purchases, taking down several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allows shoppers to negotiate again, can deter customers from making more purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims buried crane victims in Mecca and the bin Laden family was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims in the first burial in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly blaming the collapse of construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane fall at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims through the streets.
Dressed in white to some extent, the mourners chose their path and paid their respects to the victims as the first of the fallen made their final journey to the cemetery at Al-Moaissem.
Sad news was being carried around the holy site where just days earlier a construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and plunged on the worshippers.
Bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction team over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people killed by a crane falling from the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were washed through the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when his crane fell.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, says the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The British record company did not report this detail, but said that the company's executives were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are gathering for the Hajj later this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any statement on the crane collapse and its representatives were not available for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca as part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
The binladin family has been close to the saudi arabian ruling family for decades and they run major construction projects.
The late Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade whose family disowned him in the 1990s.
The crash happened amid heavy wind and rain just days before millions of people in the kingdom arrived for a pilgrimage every able-bodied Muslim must make at least once in their lives.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million rials (£174,000) will be donated to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount to the permanently injured.
The other wounded will receive half of that sum.
The head of B&Q says that Eastern European traders working for cheap are no longer the trend
British workers are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained Eastern European traders is growing
The result is 200 Screwfix stores open to merchants
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets nationwide.
It was edited by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail.
It is said that the British put away the hammers and brushes and hand them over to trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at home
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do the crafts at home, according to the head of Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home appliances, says that the large increase in trained Eastern European traders offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix retail stores and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laura says she wants to hire more women at B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by better half.
Nowadays, most of the workers are male.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends, which show more women in households doing more housework than in the past.
"The majority of the men in our stores are still men", says Laura.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of our purchasing decisions.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, one of only five women at the helm of a UK FTSE100 company, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equality of male and female CEOs.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the female workforce, including the CEO and CFO.
"It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here", says Laura.
So it wasn't hard to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both mid-year earnings and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
The result of the trend is that Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores.
The December pension payment of 600 crowns is at risk.
"It is justice for equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice", said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasised the principle of merit.
The chairman of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura said that a one-off contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to have it in standard valuation, because it would be reflected in the following years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to do that", Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), according to which next year should be valued above the law.
Marx defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of the pensioners, which she did not consider rosy.
She said a higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns and ministers are debating every stamilion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorization has decreased.
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is based on the following principles:
A veto on the December payroll would make it significantly more difficult and perhaps impossible, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD deputies Roman Sklenák therefore proposed shortening the deadline for the discussion of the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, and the right blocked it.
But the committee will have a month to do it instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions should rise by an average of about 100 crowns.
The pension amendment provides for the benefit to be paid to persons who will be entitled to a pension or part of a pension in December.
The pension is also available to those who lost their pension rights in December.
However, they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing by the end of the following year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued in January, by a rise in prices and a third of the increase in real wages.
This year, the pension is equivalent to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the final accounts of the State, the State spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about CZK 5 billion more than in the previous year.
The expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26% of all budgetary expenditure and 46% of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension increased last year by 104 to 10,714, according to the data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned his plans for a political career, he'll devote himself to science.
The billionaire was almost certain to win the Senate seat, according to Russian media.
He was to represent the Kaliningrad Oblast in the Federation Council, whose governor, Nikolai Chukanov, as a candidate of the ruling United Russia Party, defended his post in Sunday's elections.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by the citizens, but are chosen by the governor from a shortlist of three candidates whose names are announced before the governor's election.
After the election, he will choose a senator from among the three candidates.
A complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years as required by law.
The Kremlin has granted an exception to Yakunin's status as an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Tiger Theory is over.
The final straw in the hero's will is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurova - decided about Grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
John realizes that he and his wife, Olga - Elisa Balzer, are on a similar path.
He'll remember that he once had his own will and dreams, and he wants to live with dignity and freedom again.
He longs to regain control of his life - and as a solution, he chooses to escape from it, Slavík said.
Bajgar wanted to comically capture a certain type of relationship where one partner doesn't feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already worked on the series Invisible.
Yet, he was surprised to see an actor appear on camera after a long hiatus to recover from a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him the script to read, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me that he's obviously a very athletic guy.
He used to ask where he was gonna sit before the next scene.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks, even walked up a hill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director noted.
According to Bartowski, women marry tigers to make rabbits over time.
They pour him some food, but they close the door so he doesn't think of playing tiger outside the rabbit hole.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who can have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was played by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, intelligent, empathetic and well-meaning.
But she's also a usurper and wants to roast her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also describes the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and sons-in-law Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben of Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Broadcasting and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US Internet company Google has pledged up to $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees flocking to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday on Google.org, the charity arm of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled part of Teličko's visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the YES movement Pavel Telička postponed a planned trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
Baku, according to Telička, is justifying this by a European Parliament resolution last week criticizing human rights violations in Azerbaijan, which Telička co-authored.
The decision of the Azerbaijani side deprived Telička of the opportunity to meet with official partners and also of visiting political prisoners, which is subject to the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
The trip, which was planned several months in advance, Telička wanted to use to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent by the Czech Republic's Communist Party clarified.
The EP resolution condemns the 'unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan'.
It called on European officials to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was adopted shortly after the recent conviction of Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismailova for her work in exposing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky, during a visit to Novosibirsk, did not rule out the possibility of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have any plans yet.
But nothing is off the table, he said.
Russia already has a fleet naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which it has used so far mostly as a service and logistics center.
But according to Russian media reports, since the beginning of August, Russian arms and military supplies to Syria have increased.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians plan to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which remains the stronghold of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, their third phone call in the last ten days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to travel to Moscow next week to address concerns about a buildup of Russian weapons in the vicinity of Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad a losing bet.
He said that the objectives of Russia's policy in Syria were rather unclear.
He thinks Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
He said it could mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a more long-term goal, but what that is, Ernest said, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is now being speculated in the Russian press to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader is not going to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to a report in The New York Times today, the U.S. government has not ruled out that President Barack Obama and the Russian president could meet during a U.N. session.
But the White House advisers are said to be divided.
TASS quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin had not yet scheduled a meeting with Obama.
Use sesame oil on a bile-based diet. Cannabis helps boost the immune system.
A good way to increase the intake of the beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When the seeds are cold pressed, all the healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of healthy diets, such as bile.
Some extra virgin oils are useful for preventing cardiovascular disease.
According to the Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics, these are the most common cause of death in Czechs for several years.
Gilt is a problem mostly in women, and sesame oil helps.
If you are a fan of Asian cuisine, you must have a sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most oils, it can be used to heat food and has a number of health benefits.
It's often used in a bile-based diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good preventative for gallstones.
They are 90% of the causes of gallbladder inflammation, and women are three times more likely to have these problems than men.
In general, gallbladder problems are especially common in people who are overweight, do not exercise, and eat a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in a liver diet that is very similar to the bile diet.
If people want to reap all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should beware of exotic food items.
Asian producers often use roasted seeds, which have a more pronounced taste, for pressing.
But the oil loses all its active ingredients, said Ladislav Hačecký, chief executive of Bohemia Olej, a Czech company from Kraslic in Sokolovsk that produces cold-pressed virgin bio-oils.
The company also makes sesame oil, using only unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can squeeze out eight kilos of sesame.
Mechanical pressing heats the raw material to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the label 'extra virgin'.
Higher temperatures would result in a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is good for heart and vascular disease.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower oil.
A survey by Jarmila Hamerská, who led the study at Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents preferred it in a hot kitchen.
However, it is not actually suitable for frying, as it overheats at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to flavor salads and is particularly useful in the diet, where it helps prevent cardiovascular disease.
It is high in omega-6 fatty acids, which are the most cholesterol-lowering of all fatty acids.
For heart problems, you need to be careful about your total fat and calorie intake.
For example, one tablespoon of sunflower oil has 62 calories, while one tablespoon of rapeseed oil has 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are far more suitable than so-called empty calories.
They are part of the industrial processed products.
Therefore, it is advisable to use extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts as long as the sesame and the cannabis for nine months.
Keeping it in the fridge will make it even more durable.
Old oil is known to people primarily by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, the defect is not blindness at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technically, hemp seeds are considered superfoods, and hemp oil is therefore considered the healthiest of all vegetable oils.
It is so named because of its high content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
The body cannot produce these essential fatty acids on its own, and a person must obtain them from food.
Omega-3 fatty acids are especially important.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is suitable for inclusion in the diet as part of a supportive diet to boost immunity and wound healing.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using cannabis oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that Bohemia Olej is one of the best-selling companies.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take a tablespoon of it fasting in the morning.
Hemp oil is not very flavorful, but it is a great immune booster, advises Daniel Wlczek of the dwarf company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecuers is the Americans.
That's 1.4 grills for every household.
Around the world, various competitions are held to show the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people never grill in their life.
The vast majority of them barbecue several times a year.
To make grilling a success, the preparation must not be underestimated - the ideal is to marinate the meat for a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is best for this and retains the health benefits of grilling?
In general, the grilling process itself should be used sparingly.
Experts agree that a large proportion of oils begin to lose their flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also deprive the body of the nutrients that we would otherwise get from eating oils from foods that have been processed at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean extra virgin oils can't be used in barbecues.
Grape oil for barbecuing, health and beauty.
When the word meat is mentioned, the experts at Bohemia Oil of Kraslic in Sokolovsk immediately think of grape oil.
It's a great addition to meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it has the unique property of enhancing the natural flavor of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high combustion rate, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, it is one of the few oils that retains its health benefits, says Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech producers of grape seed oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid, making it effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
Grape oil also supplies our bodies with important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.
Thanks to its beneficial content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Grape oil also helps to enhance our outer beauty - it improves the elasticity of our skin, is used to treat acne, and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for preparing cold dishes, such as flavoring salads, but it is also suitable for heat treatment.
The grill can be used in two ways, marinating and grilling.
Marinating meat and fish will keep them juicy.
Three ingredients must be present when preparing the marinade: oil, acid and spices.
For example, adding apple cider vinegar to the acid will soften the meat.
The seasoning adds flavor to the meat, and the oil preserves and gives the right cut, advises Daniel Wlcek.
He also adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can penetrate through dark meat.
So the marinated meat or fish is ready to be grilled, what's next?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare a dish.
Same goes for the barbecue.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This is particularly true of flax, hemp and rapeseed oils, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grill with oil to prevent the food from burning.
The preparation of the attachments is also an essential part of the barbecue.
Practically anything goes with grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad, and many others.
For example, the chefs at Bohemia Olej recommend the Hot Summer salad.
You will need: • 1 cup of peach • 1 bundle of rhubarb • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of lettuce leaf mix • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a mixture of lettuce leaves, pickles and peaches.
You can also season it with ground chili and soy sauce, depending on your taste.
Finally, add a few drops of grape oil.
Then, for a more special taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: It's not just the medication that counts, but the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person diagnosed with it needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and many others.
But it is not just medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need counselling if they decide to have a child, and care for these patients also includes social legal counselling, recommendations for housing adjustments, etc.
Yet, this is not enough: the patient himself can have a profound influence on the course of the disease.
The more actively he fights the disease, the longer he can work and the less he needs to make major changes in his lifestyle.
Doctors warn that the passivity of the sick leaves room for the activity of the disease.
For example, regular exercise has been shown to significantly delay the time when the sufferer needs a compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their families are not subjected to myths, such as that illness automatically leads to a wheelchair.
That is why the website Give Yourself a Chance (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Yourself a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a person with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the double-edged sword is that the earlier the disease is treated, the more the doctor can do something.
That's because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process isn't as strong yet.
The sooner we intervene, the better the chances of stopping the disease and delaying its disabling effects, explains MUDr. Eva Medová of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important for people with multiple sclerosis, which usually addresses weakness of the lower limbs or impaired balance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, reduce swallowing problems, or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient", says Dr. Martina Kövári, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the Motola University Hospital.
People with multiple sclerosis may have the same disease, but each person manifests it in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always ease its symptoms.
But physical activity also strengthens the body's immune system, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another benefit of regular exercise is that it helps patients to test their abilities, which builds their self-confidence.
"Exercise also releases endorphins and makes you feel good", notes Dr. Kamila Řasová, Ph.D., of the Rehabilitation Clinic of the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By affecting the physical side, we're affecting the limbic system that's responsible for emotions.
It directly interferes with the psyche and immune system, stabilizing the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these patients were so-called sparing, now we know that they need a targeted load", says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physical therapy is to help a person remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including in the workplace.
Physical therapists work with occupational therapists to provide each person with a compensation device tailored to his or her needs.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a tough situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shocked.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
He must respond to a great burden - the loss of health.
With a soul this sick, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to make them come to the conclusion that even with a disability, a full life can be lived and that multiple sclerosis is not the end of life", says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, Airbus would not be flying.
Aerospace manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New planes are full of titanium or lightweight and strong composite materials that no one can manufacture and process right away.
Yet, alongside super-precise, computer-controlled machinery, alongside autoclaves for molding composites, you can come across something as ordinary as an apricot stove.
In a drum that resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come off the milling machine are mixed in a pile of ovens.
"No one has come up with anything better", smiles Ivan Dubský, general manager of the aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
At the Letňany site in Prague, the former Letov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They're the only company in the world that supplies doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which are being assembled in Prague, also provide access to first and upper class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest commercial aircraft, the Airbus A380.
They're also assembling a door full of composites for a new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Punctuality is the motto here.
Like the instantaneous keys the company has adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker was missing an inspection record, they would have to explain it to auditors at the Prague plant, who would regularly check that the doors were being manufactured according to agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not yet completely replaced human senses.
There are 1,500 screws on one of the doors on the A320.
These have to be manually unlocked by the technicians.
It takes them two days.
Even the sound of a hammer dropping can tell if the thread has been properly untied.
The tolerance they're moving within is minimal.
The net may protrude from zero to 0,13 millimetres above the surface of the aircraft.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
When it comes to checking, it's a trained touch.
When the controller runs its finger through a series of threads, it can tell if any are out of tolerance.
Then he'll pick up a precision perv.
Fotov was a member of the L-39 military training aircraft program prior to 1989.
But by 1991, none of them were being made.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
That's when she teamed up with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
It won the tender for the supply of emergency doors for the A321.
The talks with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were a small company to them at the time, with not enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing a stable supply in the long term", recalls Dubský.
The door to the US manufacturer would have remained closed had Letov not invited the French group Latecoere to the Prague conference of the International Aircraft Association in 1999.
I was talking about our collaboration with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, Dubsky says.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with the strong company.
As early as 2000, the assembly of the door parts for the A320 started.
Three years later, the top deck doors were added to the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new composites processing hall for the delivery of Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we couldn't have gotten these big contracts on our own.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
The partners want a supply guarantee for 20 or 30 years, Dubský explains.
Last year, the Czech company Latecoere achieved a turnover of over EUR 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers' suppliers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 specific production processes and certificates of qualifications for key employees.
Without them, the company couldn't make any aircraft doors.
Obtaining certificates that manufacturing processes meet customer requirements and maintaining them in repeated checks costs millions of crowns, according to Dubski.
The manufacturing processes change every year.
They're more precise and strict.
We need to train the staff, re-equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubský adds.
Now the company is finalising a process to coat it with zinc and nickel to replace the previously harmful cadmium.
They got the assignments from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they were using in Prague.
The Boeing people are coming, they're going to test the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They're gonna check our lab, too.
They test a set of samples themselves in their lab, and then they compare the results to ours, which is a Dubski approximation of the way the customers control them.
The Prague firm is rewarded with long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant, the production of embracers is now up and down.
For the A320, it produces half the total door volume.
It is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer to replace the Czech Latecoere.
But that doesn't mean he can say whatever price he wants behind the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It tells you how much a door will cost after 10, 50, 100 pieces are made.
The price per piece keeps falling to a certain threshold.
We have to fit into this pricing model.
If not, we'll lose, Dubsky says.
Half the hall where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400M military aircraft are being assembled is empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic door assembly line is being built here for the A320 Neo.
The charging will be speeded up and made more precise.
"This is the trend in aviation assembly", adds Dubský.
The sale of his future line is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3278 of the new A320 so far.
Just a few metres away, a line will be built to complete the assembly of the A380's upper deck doors.
It's a strategic decision for our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubsky says.
However, before that, the company must pass qualification tests, for example to install some electrical and electronic devices in the doors of the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further developing the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is also expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit to the company to be able to work with composites in addition to metal", Dubský says proudly.
However, Latecoere is reaching the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place on the Letov compound where he's based.
Before the French mother came in, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's got 800, and in three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing keep up with the hundreds of new planes airlines order each year, they don't have to worry about jobs.
Despite having contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere was facing the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay the September loan.
Finally, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she traded some of the loans for shares.
The creditors acquired a 37,4% stake in the company by increasing its capital by EUR 57,4 million.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, to EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company subscribed new shares to the existing shareholders for EUR 222,9 million.
In total, it raised EUR 280 million in share capital.
The entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which together account for 85% of sales.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from interested parties.
It has orders in the order book of 2.6 billion euros, equivalent to four years' production.
French media say Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the drip.
The Czech race in Prague's Letňany is important for the groups.
It contributes 16% to the group's turnover.
The largest foreign branch of the group by number of employees.
MEPs supported a larger share of the state's coal tax.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
The government claims that the tax is to have a neutral impact on the revenue of the local budgets, as it is to be higher.
In the year before last, the municipalities received about CZK 450 million and the state budget CZK 150 million from the fees.
The municipality's coal production cost about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the compensation from the permitted production areas to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall remain fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the deputies that the municipalities will get annually instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but by government regulation.
The compensation shall be recalculated as a factor of the quantity of ore extracted and the rate for each type of ore.
According to the Government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government regulation may not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, there is no tax in this case, as the State charges the mineral, which is state property.
The fees are paid only to the municipalities whose territory is affected by the extraction.
In the case of deep-level mining, three-quarters of the coal goes to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will apply to the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money the State collects on mining fees will be assigned to a specific purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair mining damage or to provide a mine rescue service.
The bill was criticized by opposition lawmakers today, who claimed it would harm mining-affected communities and counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to get the finance minister to improve his budget", said David Kádner (Úsvit), elected in the Ústeck region.
The increase in unemployment in Mostec was warned by KSČM MP Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government to be finalized.
The explanatory statement states that the mining companies claim that the increase in fees will not affect coal prices because more than 90% of the prices are long-term contracts.
The main consumers such as power plants or boilers should therefore not feel the price increase.
'On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating costs, which would mainly mean a reduction in the number of employees,' the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in fees is sustainable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and especially the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the revenues for the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak Army's bottom should not take effect until after 2020.
According to him, the limits on ČSA should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time to make interest rate decisions for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve is set to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A Reuters survey of 80 economists found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will sit still for a while and keep interest rates in the 0-0.25 percent range.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central bank may be able to break out of the zero-sum game and start the process of normalizing interest rates", says Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy has done quite well, with a recovery that's added trillions of dollars to the national account and created only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They warned markets to be prepared for a hike, but circumstances suggest they also see a high chance against such a move.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day his colleague - wrote a note claiming he was guilty of his first murder and wished he could take it back, government officials revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called the police Monday morning around 10:00 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked dispatch to send officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night", and he also mentioned that there's a cute dog in the house that won't bother anyone, but he's upset.
The police asked for the caller's name, but Lamb didn't identify himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why the house was being shot at.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb that said, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me.
After leaving a note, Lamb made a 300-mile journey to Delta State University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that something was clearly going on in Mr. Lamb's head.
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was no evidence of a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was "a wonderful person".
The divorce was 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was shocked by the whole thing.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blitz, dated Lamb for about three years.
Always wanting to help others, Knowles let herself be heard.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to jail.
When officers caught up with him on the freeway near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled over and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to his resume posted on the school's website, Lamb earned a doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things certainly take their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out for a couple of months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back has been left in tears by this injury and out of action for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moreno's reckless intervention in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in hospital".
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a kid who comes to Manchester at 18 has a very difficult time, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he'll play this season.
Moreno was lucky not to get a red card and a penalty.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad operation on both legs.
Shaw's tweet reads: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger".
Manchester United have recorded Luke Shaw's injury in their loss to PSV.
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It was a very bad injury".
When any player leaves the field with an injury like that, everybody's very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a game for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
I was unable to see this moment.
I just saw the ball go in a different direction, so it looked like it hit him, but I didn't see any action on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after surgery on Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows The Lorax better than you do?
Every parent knows this: When a child becomes enamored with a book, it does not take long for him to learn it almost by heart.
You can't be David Cameron, though.
When asked by a children's charity to name his favourite children's book, the Prime Minister chose the Lorax, a 1971 Dr Seuss fairy tale.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and powerful, it's the kind of book I like to read to my kids because it always has a picture or message behind it that I haven't seen before".
Well, except that in the next paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the book's plot from a clip from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill out the original text.
"In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by granting her a wish to see a real tree", is a summary of the book that records the object of love of Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads like a summary lift from the movie The Lorax, which is available on the Internet Movie Database, and begins: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey".
Being an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not have been familiar with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being ravaged by a voracious, tree-walking industrialist, the Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorax, is a hunchbacked, moustached creature who "speaks for the trees".
Most likely, this relatively minor PR assignment was given to an assistant who never read the Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to have come from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was provided by an employee of Cameron's, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of being forgotten by England, but he still holds
To face Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but after watching the team England have selected for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat they suffered last time in the Test series will be very unlikely.
I also wouldn't rule out the possibility of a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting lineup, and the collective mindset is strong, too; they're not going to take the scars of 2012, just youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at Test series level, represents an attacking possibility.
Adam Lyth has been dropped from the England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to ignore Adam Lythe is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests stood against two good attacks in tough conditions and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are judged on performance.
For example, there were no questions around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because, and I've said this before, players are their own best coaches.
A few more half-centuries and Lyth could have extended his run, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come up.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performance was not exactly 100 percent, which is not surprising to me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much probation a batter gets to show up is a tough one.
Lyth got seven hats  just like Sam Robson before him  while Nick Compton got nine.
Compton's the only one who's had a chance at home and away.
The only thing you can complain about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean first even though Lyth was in top form but this missed opportunity is now in the past.
And here comes Alex Hales, and he's a batter that I'm very positive about.
He's the X-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season when he made 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all this will depend, of course, on the overall makeup of the UAE.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, was taken up and I have no objection to it.
I don't understand why Strokemaker can't hit a home run and this left-handed man has already proven himself to be a great cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them and it doesn't make much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 Tests before his debut in 2001.
He made three centuries in an instant and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is joining the team as a backup spinner and when I had the chance to watch him, I was impressed as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats -- average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball -- and I see that as a starter, but not a lot of spinners are going to raise their hands, and the selectors have opted for the youth.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, it seems England have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a Test match consultant could be a masterpiece.
He's one of the most beautiful guys to play, who brings a wealth of experience by having experience in all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on as part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and a relentless spark.
I always felt he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahel, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they're voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes has been given a day off, just as Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many may disagree, coaches and coaches don't set a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work matters in the end.
Such decisions should never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-advised renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets into more trouble with each passing day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to lead the Labour Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday to the parade.
The aliens also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in a variety of crises - not all of which are their fault - some member states are fed up with the British egocentric agenda of concessions and disruptive treaty changes that most did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want it even if they were to replace Social Security.
We could even call it a selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then go home saying they're winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain in Europe that is not self-absorbed - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about us leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany's carefully balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad for her, as it was for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's hard to watch them break their legs helping selfies of Britons who could better invest their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - something they themselves don't want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Regotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiation".
To their own detriment, Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU the media oligarchs are because they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 that backed our entry in 1973 at a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, the sly Euro-opportunist who made his name as Brussels' EU straight bananas reporter in the early 1990s.
For all his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-evading thugs, foreigners hacking phones and the pseudo-overseas department that owned most of the big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a rabid gorilla, you have to throw bananas at it so it doesn't eat you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's referendum routine, ever since Blair accepted the principle of the abrogated EU constitution, which was flooded by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him the expelled card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he mustn't waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-adopting the strategy of the Murdoch boycott of Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, who left his BBC chair on Sunday.
Corbin's official stance on Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He claims he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the rampant Ukip trend and the wild shores of Tory little Englanderism can certainly take it.
Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said the same thing on radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't bring himself to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s when his grandfather fought for his loyalty on television without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's fight was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all costs" - Ben's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told his colleagues and lawmakers at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, whatever the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - news discipline remains important in an age of daytime television and especially in the faith, feast of paranoia and betrayal that social media is.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that.
But the basic distortion of McDonnell and Corbyn's EU membership - in line with their Bennite besieging economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his NATO rant - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand the meaning of it all for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions from Britain when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed in the blatant "poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the conservative government in power is cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize e-reviews published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry, researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released a "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers questioned the extent of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for BMJ questioned the claim that it was "built on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They state that the public might expect PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people called to produce a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had allegedly previously obtained funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also endorsed the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report, it said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted to receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the panel's selection is not available, but it includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industry funding in the newspaper.
Some other attendees are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The tobacco management also attended the meeting at PHE.
The report produced by this group "specifically admits" the lack of "hard evidence of harmfulness of most products on most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a pathway to smoking for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the BMJ claim had been answered before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers will die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By highlighting the clear evidence that, while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they do only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national competency.
The BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief executive
Former Channel 4 chief executive Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes not made by other British television broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people into complex broadcast times compared to its rivals "the highest rated show, and on channels like BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to link up with the BBC for the six years he worked at Channel 4.
"I fight the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state funding", Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Committee as part of the debate over the BBC's future.
If you keep the royalties, which I'm not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, then at least the creation of programs that others don't produce or commission should be reduced.
They're running The Voice in prime time because they want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would be broadcasting it is a ridiculous joke, and of course, pointless.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders is another, and of course, home-produced.
Honestly, other channels would have given them a right hand.
I can't understand how these are a public broadcasting service.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the least.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about raising ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support".
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows echoes those of former Sky chief executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more spoiled BBC public service programmes "move to BBC4 where quite often you can't measure the audience but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they are about to go on their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn of licence fee revenue, 'But of course we do all these obscure programmes that nobody watches.'
They're broadcasting at a time when no one's looking.
As for the royalty, Johnson told the commission: "I would urge you to find a more regressive system for who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think 150 British pounds a year is a lot of money, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I'd be surprised if they pay that much, because they don't watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, speaking before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He confirmed that the BBC's small output had now been previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio - and it should take the example of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the topic of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which were only a handful of those that were broadcast on television, and link up with commercial reporters so we could all see them online.
 Sonogenetics, or the control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the fungus moves.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The tiny bugs change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching on genetically modified motor neuron cells that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
The researchers said that these worms are a prime example of a new technique called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activate them outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrodes are inserted into a patient's brain to stimulate the brain, a technique used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease, for example.
The worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they do when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that then travel through the worms' bodies.
Enhanced ultrasound waves act on TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves open and activate these channels, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
To control the worms with ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and carried into the worms, where they activated the modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
Chalasani, however, suggested that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases", Chalasani said.
He added that the method could also be used to treat muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture facility - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements that shame the British arms trade.
Watch this video on the anti-arms market from Amnesty International.
The dreaded killer drones!
Leg chains that break your ankles!
The shells!
And electric stunning batons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no doubt that this advert at the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes through the International Veselice defence and security facility at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being waged with posters popping up at bus stops and subways that demand a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from September 15 to 18?" reads one, using the font of the London Underground's DLR line sign to become a picture of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DPR... customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute them throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which are £6 per Allen key, which reportedly "get access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism".
One of the commercial parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a teaching assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists move on to work with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to get out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another one of the posters against the arms trade greets the passengers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was seen by over 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would have been surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads - he saw a blank space in the Excel calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with creating more realistic, risky corporate ads, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, we managed to attract more people".
"They did a fantastic job of helping raise our concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action to ensure that torture facilities are not illegally trafficked on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside Excel, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US Army for "an AT4CS RS on the shoulder".
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that delivers amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it is, it's not gonna be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for college life
Eleven years ago, I moved into a junior college as a neglectful 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I had bothered - and the many, long complaints of others.
Everything I've learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to the railroad can range from mildly nerve-wracking to downright shocking.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you took a year off, what you think of Corbyn and why you honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because, guys, it's just a yeast extract.
Take a deep breath.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to if your eyelashes were in the same fire and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Give the people room.
People's rooms are often converted into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and communal public spaces, but they are also rooms where people dress and arrange their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship.
Introverts come to college short.
Your room should be a refuge, yet many roads are becoming an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, social, and conducive to lifelong friendships.
It can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back the energy I used to talk to you".
Try to identify when a classmate is tired of socializing - and perhaps write down a knock-down.
Speaking of knocking, knock.

He saw a couple of things.
Make friends by baking.
Because you started college at the peak of baking mania, knocking on people's doors and having a show with a slice of baked cakes seems a little less weird, less like, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask you some personal questions".
Offering home-cooked treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and they may end up assigning your face to a pleasant surprise.
That, of course, is the object of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed chunks of flour, sugar, and tuna will likely ensure that others will pretend to be asleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime on college campuses.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double-check with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're furious inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to handle it a little more grown-up than my roommate who traded her milk for dishwashing detergent to punish the thief.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little bit because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had a paper in the morning.
Their answer was to turn up the music.
When it finally went quiet at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours, then played her own music loudly, locked the door, and went off to her three-hour paper.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same schools as you?
And conversely, wouldn't it be awfully embarrassing if you mistaken your roommate for your future spouse, slept with her, broke up with her, and had to see her every day, and maybe she took over your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you can't please your heart - but if your hot roommate isn't 100% your future mate, at least try to talk some sense into your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize someone left their keys in their unlocked room, there's only a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something - never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put their keys in a water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Despite the uncertain prospects for the future, Eve was looking forward to the twins.
Eva had a rough time with her now seven-year-old son, Victor.
Her father had divorced her, leaving her to prepare and raise her offspring alone.
I was able to cope with the situation fairly quickly - I was very excited about the baby and looked for the positive.
I tried not to worry about the uncertainty and the fact that I was going to be alone with the baby.
And I certainly had hope that we wouldn't be alone for long, Eva remembers today from her first pregnancy.
She met her older brother Vashek on the Internet and started talking about her favorite movies.
Your uncle even drove Eva and Victor home from the maternity ward, but he didn't get too caught up in the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while", Eva described in the documentary series Four in Three.
The theme of the third series of the Czech TV series is the search for happiness on the second try.
She cared for Vitek and provided for the family financially through part-time work and the help of her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for another's child did not ultimately ruin Vash's affection for Eva.
They definitely got together around Vítka's second birthday and he now understands Vášek as his dad and calls him that too.
Although Vashek has two grown daughters, he says that at age 60, he enjoys fatherhood and is also more involved with his children.
In addition to Vitek, they had a two-year-old Leontinka and finally twins.
"Your father came into our family naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked to me much about relationships", smiles Eva.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins, Emma and Ela, were born by Caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis late in her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and function of bile acids, which are then found in excessive quantities in the blood of the pregnant woman and are manifested in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn fetus, threatening premature birth and death, and usually resolves spontaneously in the mother after childbirth.
Emma and Ela were born healthy, to the happiness of Eva and Vashek, even though they were only 36 weeks.
Emi was placed in an incubator in the intermediate ward, where Vasko's niece works, who was able to take her in and house her.
Elinka was bigger, and as soon as she was transferred from the ICU to my room, she was with me, describing the difficult period after Eva's birth.
She spent 20 days in the hospital until doctors approved the release of the babies, who had by then reached the two-pound limit.
Waiting to pick up the babies in the maternity ward was not a joy for Eva.
"I was driven mad by the longing for my husband and children", recalls a difficult separation from a six-month-old mother of four.
She and her husband also considered signing the reverse, in part because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, that did not happen, and the doctors released Eva and the twins to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are on CNT1 Tuesday night at 9:45 p.m.
A large family can be tame.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric fence and cramped conditions.
The house did not grow, but Vashek made Eve happy by installing a gas stove to make cooking for six more convenient.
If it's hot, we'll take a taxi.
Eva is convinced that children are more likely to be impressed by the family's comfort and pleasant atmosphere than by the size or the opulence of the house.
So far, we've been putting it together very nicely, better than we expected.
It's harder to hide clutter in a small space and sometimes overcome a rolling baby, but at least we're all close, smiles Eva, who can find the positive in every situation.
Vaska's job as a film lighting director is no guarantee of a regular income.
That's why he occasionally drives around the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In her 60's, she says she can physically handle the family finances and the children, but for how long?
"I realize that because of our age difference, I will one day be the one to support this family", admits Eva bluntly when asked about the future.
She'd like to get back to work, but even more tempted by the possibility of starting her own business.
I'm not exactly the type of person to be hired with four kids.
And if it gets worse, my husband and I can take a taxi, jokes the nice blonde.
Apple has a yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a sturdier chassis, or a touchscreen, these are, in short, the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Because Apple's trend so far has been that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The only exception was the third and fourth generations, which had slightly increased in weight compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the disadvantage of the novel was really negligible.
But that's not the case with the new iPhones.
Compared with last year's iPhones, the smaller model weighed 14 grams, while the larger one weighed 20 grams.
On the one hand, it's no surprise that last year's Apple-in-the-pocket affair was a major blow to the company.
The new chassis is made of a more durable 7000 aluminium alloy, which also reflects on the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
Apple's new technology is 3D Touch, which lets the displays recognize the force of touch.
To do this, the display had to be fitted with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The new iPhones' displays have more than doubled in weight compared to previous generations.
The smaller iPhone went from 12 grams to 29 grams, and the larger iPhone went from 19 to 40 grams.
So, in the iPhone 6s, the screen is the heaviest component used.
The new model weighs only 143 grams, and this is achieved by the use of a degreasing crust that has touched most of the other components.
The battery is the heaviest component used on the larger model, but its weight has not changed from its predecessor.
Even here, the biggest increase is seen in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
How practical the new technology is for the display will be seen in the application.
The first users will be able to try it out on Friday, September 25th, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus go on sale in select countries.
Have breakfast cereals been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Italy, archaeologists have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They found traces of modern human habitation from different periods, including murals, tool remains, and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which is dated by instruments to be about 30,000 years old, scientists have found something that looks very much like the remains of a breakfast buffet.
The findings suggest that the oat grains were traces of the process that produced the popular cereal.
Today, the grains are first soaked, then dried, stripped of their husk, called plough, then ground and sprayed on the surface.
In the Paglicci cave, grains were found that were apparently heated or burned and then likely crushed between two millstones - at least as evidenced by the use of the two stones in the cave.
Thus, in their publication for the journal PNAS, the scientists were unable to prove that the entire process of making the flakes took place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the cereal, but the suggestion that it was with some liquid and quite possibly hot, of course, makes perfect sense.
It is also a very interesting testimony to the intensive use of grain by humans long before agriculture began.
If the fleece interpretation is correct, the earliest fleeces predate agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station reports from the Brno City Transport Authority.
So I listened again to the report of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Naughty, Ghost, Frog, Spratsky.
Of course, the trolley was a little noisier, so the male voice was a little less understandable than before when the stops were announced by the female voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so it is more recognizable in the deeper noise of traffic than a man's.
The DPMB argues that the announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings made in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for a good few decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops by heart, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who don't know Brno and for whom these reports are mainly intended, can be confused and can say that the stop they were supposed to get on was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of announcer - but better yet, the announcer - should be made again, this time underlined by the usual traffic noise and engine noise, in which the buzzing of the bus speaker is almost lost.
So we don't have to listen to the names of the stations Water Herp, Smyrna, or then the sinkhole in the creaking shawl, which I switched to in Komarov.
I suppose my old-age hearing didn't suddenly deteriorate so much during that one day when the stop sign changed.
Before that day, I understood those reports pretty well.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the trackman's notes.
Few people today know what the biggest and most clever party controls were.
I took the liberty of recalling it.
The bus was late.
I was in the dispatcher's office the minute the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't bump into Comrade Chief, he came a minute before you and he seems not in the mood", the dispatcher remarked as I entered the arrivals book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write me that I'm going to the precincts to review the small mechanical.
I can't. I have my exams today.
Everyone's so fucked up about it.
What's the matter?
"You'll see", the dispatcher said.
Next time you will.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the door of the chief's house opened and the chief appeared.
Stuck, with a stone face, in perfectly matched uniform.
"Good morning, Chief", I said respectfully and quickly pressed two buttons on my uniform.
"Good morning", came the reply, and I hurried up to the second floor, not noticing the cold, sinister tone with which the old man answered.
"You're kidding", greeted me Eva, an engineer, an elderly lady whom I held in high esteem.
She was even the head of the company before her comrades took her out.
There's a check-up and you're just arriving.
I've asked a lot of people what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they come once every three years, they have to go to them all, and it's pretty awkward.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled out a folder of periodic reports and there was a phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me at once", said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
We just met and nothing"... I muttered, but no one answered, each with his own thoughts.
"Good day, Comrade Chief, I've come at your command", I reported, barely entering the headquarters.
The chief was sitting at his desk, looking at some notebook.
"Comrade Mechanic", he said after a moment, without raising his head, still carefully examining the notebook, "I do not like your behavior at all".
He dropped the notebook on the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared at me with his usual, nasty, mean, stinging look.
I didn't know.
What's the matter, man?
Yesterday, the deputy praised me for my work in the last few months and said he was very happy with me.
That the chief did a very good thing by pulling me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
You know, you're a distance runner, and you have to act like it.
The greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I've been using that greeting since I was a kid, that I was raised that way, and I don't see anything wrong with it.
For a chief, it was like a red rag for a turkey.
"You're on a socialist railroad and the only acceptable greeting is honor of the job", the headmaster snapped.
And besides, you're still getting your superiors wrong.
You say "sir" once and "comrade" twice.
But I'm not a Mr. Chief to you, I'm Comrade Chief.
The deputy is the deputy, the chief is the chief!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of the job, or the comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your advantage not to be on the side", said the chief, who had calmed down a bit.
We'll talk about that later.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a retirement account upstairs.
That was not good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good on them.
For a moment, he gave me a cold, stinging look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his high-pitched tickle.
He was only a few years older and he was playing God, actually, comrade god.
Sneaky, arrogant, authoritarian, arrogant, whatever it was that suited him at the time.
He's been booed by everyone.
Well, he's the chief.
Actually, not everyone, the party chairman, he liked him, like all party members and non-party members.
But the chieftain had many to lean on, especially those he could exercise his superiority over.
He just wiped me for total bullshit.
I thought something about an ass and it cost me enough to not shoot it in the face.
But I wouldn't go back to being a pickpocket for a day, let alone a road agent.
How am I gonna feed two kids?
And the house that's being built!
I was in a rage, but I kept it together.
I won't give him that pleasure.
"That is all for now, you may go", concluded the chief, and began again to scrutinize carefully the notebook which he had previously held in his hand.
I got a call at 12:30.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, it would be good.
Only Eugene said bitterly, as was his custom, that they could not throw us all out, because the work would have to be done by Comrade Chief alone with his loyal ones, and that he was not in danger.
He emphasized the word "comrade" as if he knew what the old man had wiped me out for this morning.
It was a nice gathering in the chief's office.
Comrade chief at his desk and at the long advisory table other comrades who were to decide whether I should be an official or not.
HR, ROH chairman, personnel clerk, special purpose reporter, something of a military contrast, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the slums.
A common railroad worker, he was a slasher or a pitchfork thrower.
But also a former security guard.
Word is he wasn't much fun back then, he was a pretty beast.
The bad language said he had finished school in the seventh grade, had learned nothing, knew nothing.
And when the crime was dropped, he ended up at the pickpocket.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
I had a little soul in me, an inexhaustible doughnut in my throat.
The staff member read the report from the civic committee at the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, and I'm breathing a little better.
Then the opinion of the street organization of the party.
He was copying a report from the civic committee, maybe both by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of long-time party members refused to appear before the review board and subsequently resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief gave me a sharp look.
The sketch artist noticed and stopped reading.
The chief has ordered that he continue.
It's only gotten worse.
I was a member of the city committee of the SSM and I was won as the party's candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and I had a wedding in a church, besides the National Committee.
I have failed the party's trust in the worst way.
That's why I was cut from her list of candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, a former party member, had a church funeral when she died.
I'm showing a negative attitude towards the role of party leader.
When the cartoonist finished, only the chief's tapping of the pencil on the tabletop broke the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wished I was somewhere far away.
I kept saying in my mind, "Communists - supermen, communists - supermen".
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could fix the switches without a fucking check.
But now?
The career of a railroad clerk was over before it even began.
Go back to the platoon?
I'm not sure I can. The chief's gonna kick me out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade in question?" interrupted the tense silence the chief with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to the report on his previous employment.
You got it here?
The sketch artist obviously had no second thoughts.
He was dripping sweat on his sides, winking nervously, as if he were being examined.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Well", said the chief with a hint of cheerfulness, which often heralded a storm.
On the surface, he was a praiseworthy student, with an honors degree in industrial engineering, a job at a job-paying job as a locksmith, and a 120% average.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade?" he turned again to the sketch artist, who felt that things were starting to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be a sketch artist.
Here, a comrade gave it to me when I boarded.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came in, he went to the precinct, joined the platoon", the hairdresser mumbled.
And they don't require reviews, so his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So, when you were hired as a technician, this piece of paper was enough", the chief said.
The staff member blinked nervously and had no answer.
"It's okay, we'll discuss it later", the chief concluded, and the cadet was obviously relieved.
It's all right for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
I'm gonna throw up and it's over!
My eyes were dark, my heat was pouring.
A flurry of blame and blame followed, and I knew I was the most repulsive creature in the world, not worthy of the least mercy.
That by inserting an incomplete report I misled a comrade personnel inspector, and I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from the stylist at the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element who, in the time of building real socialism, supports and even participates in the growth of religious darkness.
That, that, there was a lot of things that I did, or maybe I'll do, and I was quietly praying that it would stop.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I got kicked out of the mechanic's chair.
I didn't care if they took away my crotch.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the Comrade Chief.
"That's enough, comrade chief", said the party chairman suddenly, and he forcefully interrupted the chief Levites.
Here, comrade, you have made a mistake, a terrible mistake.
What a mistake, he just did something stupid!
But he's already had his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade chief!
What could be worse for a young man than having his door shut temporarily!
To open up to him again, he'll have to prove that he's changed, that he's worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he that calculating or parroting phrases from party training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who will give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat mistaken comrade in his efforts to reform!
It's your party duty, and no one can take it away from you!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us.
Here, comrade, you must see that the Party has not forgotten you.
That as a loving mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one said a word.
No one expected this turn of events.
I'm the least of them.
"I agree with you, Comrade Chairman", the chief nodded in an icy attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd hear that's exactly what I was coming to.
They all nodded in agreement, but they didn't believe a word he said.
"So I've been confirmed as an independent primary care referral", I said as I returned to the office, and I immediately burst into tears.
It's a good thing everyone was at lunch except for Eva, the engineer.
She listened in silence to my disjointed account of recent experiences, and I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the kettle and made the cups.
Meanwhile, she was talking about makeup practices.
Like one review, often full of praise, they hand over to the person, and the other one, which is full of dirt, they send to the new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but in a pickle factory, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our makeup artist?
He's just worried about where he's gonna eat or drink, and that's how it ended up.
"He's got it from the old man", she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it tonight.
You keep an eye on him, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
In fact, far worse than a chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a power-hungry hoarder.
The coffee water started boiling and the office immediately filled with the smell of freshly poured coffee.
I put a lump of sugar in the cup and quietly stirred the hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the worst.
I'm not getting fired now, and the next checkup isn't for three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, I'm not going to forget this day.
Published in the anthology LITERÁTI NA TRATI II. by the publishing house EPIKA
The symbol of the village came to life.
The windmill over Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from afar because it is placed on a fifteen-meter-high pole.
People in the area call it the "Clum Windmill".
For the municipality of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem that the municipality received on the occasion of a gathering of locals in 2010.
"We asked for a sign and we wanted a fan on the sign, of course, everyone knows it in the area", said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum windmill is a local engineering landmark.
It is also a bit of a modern day reminder of the times when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided on a solution that was then suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the Chichov branch, a well was dug 20 feet [7 m] deep.
Three years later, a metal structure with a wind pump pumped the water into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc of Hranic in Moravia at a cost of 2,400 crowns", says a memorial inscription on the ground floor fence of the mast structure.
After several repairs and a few windmill failures, the pump was retired in 1971.
Then, on May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the struggle for water began to be written: a new water supply line was put into service in Chlum.
The windmill is now a broken city symbol and a local rarity.
Dominant was put into operation at this year's town hall.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlumski decided to repair and put the windmill back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - a half meter smaller in diameter.
The wheel was mounted on a pole, but that same year it had to be taken down.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the right material and the wheel was not able to withstand strong winds.
Then the Chlum dominatrix lay undressed under the roof for several years.
But since June of this year, the wheel has been spinning on the high mast again.
On the occasion of a gathering of the villagers, the community had a replica of the wheel modified and reinstalled it on top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only pumps useful water from the well into the blind shoulder of the assailant.
And during the summer, we shut it down completely because the well was low on water.
At least it was empty.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the windmill shaft from the pump in the suction basket again", explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the windmill has been registered as a municipal landmark, but it is the only one of its kind in the whole of the Highlands.
A similar element in the sign is in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovic and Zelené Hora in Vyškovsk, in Kuželov in Hodonín, in Partutovice in Přerovsk or in Police in Vsetín.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafat, Tripoli's supporting Goian admitted.
"I remember the game against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone in my career", smiled 34-year-old Goian at a pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georgie Hague, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I can score a goal for Sparta now.
Only this time we won't lose", Goian continued.
This man, who has played 60 games for Romania, is a key player in the Greek team.
As a stopgap, it will face the onslaught of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people come, no hell, he says of the Greek duel of the Spartan Hybus.
And he has a partial idea of what's coming Thursday night.
I know Fataie well, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their games back then.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta, too, Goian said.
He didn't name any other Prague club players, so the question was whether he knew David Lafat, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Spartak.
Goian smiled and, with a slightly reproachful look, pointed at the Czech journalist.
The helpless look on his face was, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he turned on.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta is a very team player.
He's got some really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone else but Fataia.
The Spartans know that about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, he's a defensive player for Asteras, he's their game organizer", said Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian may have had his best years, but he has a very interesting football career.
He was once a favourite of Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steauy he moved to Palermo in Italy, and also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, they play regularly in European cups, they fight to win the Czech league.
For me, he's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group off on a high note.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, said Goian.
I'm in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is looking forward to the Czech opponent.
I'm with you.
But I can tell you for the whole team, we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering a listing on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola's new headquarters should be in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for the purpose of trading its shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the group's headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on society", says Daniel Buryš, CFO of the Kofola Group.
'In connection with the transfer of the Group's headquarters, the shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.'
In order to be listed on the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalising a prospectus for the securities, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding company's registered office and the related transfer of shares will be carried out in the form of a private transaction involving only the existing shareholders.
The operation will therefore not offer any shares to the public or to new investors.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the financial situation of the company.
The company has previously indicated that a possible share offer could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on stock exchanges in the Czech Republic and Poland, including a placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of Czech TV's objectivity in reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of mainstream Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time broadcasting the main news programme of Czech Television.
How did she do?
When the journalism faculty teaches about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today's broadcast of Czech Television Events.
The migrant crisis was covered by about 80% of the news coverage.
Until the first minute when the Czech Republic reported on the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on the police euphemistically called their patience ran out - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-immigrant propaganda was already going on - judge for yourself the titles of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a big space for non-profit organizations to criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in a Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees are not only a threat, but an opportunity.
The Czech Republic consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee rather than migrant.
The most striking thing is that the Czech Republic consistently uses images of small children and women in its illustrations.
She said in the same broadcast that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Mostly propaganda, unlike any that communist agitators have ever produced.
I must say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
Once I was promoted to a one-bedroom apartment, I soon ceased to be the sole occupant.
I used to have fish movin' into my backyard toilet.
Domestic fish, insects with imperfect transformation, that is, not going through that transformation from caterpillar to beetle, and the young look like an adult, only they're tiny and growing gradually.
I hated them and didn't want to lose them.
First by hand, then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided blue crystals to kill them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it has successfully eliminated them.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs in a similar way.
A box of some juvenilizer that the ants brought into the nest and then prevented the queen from producing new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went on, I became more and more fascinated with insects, and I became more inclined to think that they had the same right to life as we do.
And I've learned from experience that interfering with the ecosystem is not a success, and one pest can replace another.
The truth about fleas and bugs is I wouldn't mind making my karma worse by killing them.
In our new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish don't come up our throats, they should just eat the shells, the shells, the invisible algae and all that.
Their peaceful existence was disrupted by a spider.
He was a common type of vagabond who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he lived off the occasional fly and mosquito, which only made us more comfortable.
Since he has been with us for several years, we have learned that he feeds mainly on fish and that he seems to have kept the population at a robust level.
By intimate regular contact with each needle we found out it was a female.
We've seen romantic courtship with a partner about a third the size of a man, as he gently nibbles at the web's fibers to avoid being eaten before he reaches the desired copulation.
It lasted for about three days, when they didn't move or respond to our checks.
Under the toilet where the love play took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
Just when we thought she was done, we were surprised by the number of tiny spiders hanging from the tree.
They soon disappeared.
Some of them were eaten by mommy, some of them ran off.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but a month or two later, she reappeared on the ceiling.
Right, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the bathroom resident.
For a while, she watched our behavior carefully from the ceiling and, by moving under the toilet, evaluated our nonaggression as friendship.
The number of the somewhat-broadened fishes declined, and the spider quietly pursued its normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed in a year.
Our daughter, meanwhile, had grown to the age when using the toilet was considered shameful.
We've tolerated it so far, but the eternal spilling of its contents has been getting to us.
We kept urging her to use the bathroom.
But the daughter found an excuse to keep her bad habit in that spider she could see very well when wiping.
Our talk about the spider seeing the house, the luck of the draw, didn't work.
She forced her bedside with tears and screams.
There was no change.
There came a time when the spider had to take command in order to advance his daughter's development.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a jar and banished over a balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt bad after living together for so long, like I was kicking a relative out.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and start to multiply in geometric order.
Wonder what, a week, two, we haven't had one.
I started speculating on the cause.
I wondered if the spider had somehow grown them in a way that was ant-like, that the toilet environment wasn't as conducive to their existence as we thought.
But then the first medium-sized pieces appeared, and they were swarming again.
I had to come up with another theory about why they disappeared, and I figured their connection to the spider must have been because if they couldn't see it, it was hiding somewhere else and they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator and his rapid disappearance triggered some kind of panic response in them.
Especially since I have no illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some degree of shyness, but not that they would respond to a wave of the hand or a rapid movement.
My daughter's been using the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot the toilet.
All that's left is to attract another spider.
I'm broadcasting my wishes now, and I hope they didn't betray me after the execution.
Otherwise we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The words of a brilliant scientist of the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive so deeply into everything that he always came up with amazing findings.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
He is best known for his special and general theory of relativity, which is the best description of the universe at its gigantic scale.
And we can't forget his explanation of the photo-effect or the idea of electromagnetic field quantization.
No doubt, the very description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that they prefer easy stops for closer acquaintance.
But it's not easy.
But he would not be Albert Einstein if he had not found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: A clock near your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems like an hour - and that is relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his whole plethora of famous quotes these ten that literally captivated me.
Smart people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
But there's only one person who can prove me wrong at any time.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what reflects the empty table?
I don't know what they'll fight in World War III, but in World War IV, it'll be sticks and stones.
There are a thousand ways to kill time, but none to bring it back.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much is too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that my life depended on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.
And finally, I can't help but mention Einstein's formula for success: If we take A for success, the formula is: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is keeping your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín region are waiting for changes worth 1.5 billion.
"It is an achievement when we consider that all four have been in the black all year", said captain Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the regional facilities is at this moment around CZK 32 million.
This is mainly due to higher premiums from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
This also shows that after years of poor health, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
The result is that construction is under way in Kroměříž, Vsetín, Hungarian Castle and Zlín, at a total cost of nearly $1.4 billion.
The long period when we bought mainly appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top-notch healthcare cannot be done, explained the regional deputy for health Lubomír Nečas.
He's looking forward to the changes in all the hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, they are now selecting a supplier for a new interior pavilion worth almost 300 million crowns.
They're planning a dialysis facility in the outskirts.
The Hungarian Castle wants to build a new boarding house for about 200 million to the central pavilion that opened this year.
And the long-delayed construction of a new central hospital in Baťov, Zlín, will cost three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, for patients and for doctors", said Věra Prousková, director of the hospital in Vsetín, for example.
The five-story building is expected to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable facilities for the inpatient and neurology departments, dialysis, a new ambulance, beds, and an intensive care unit.
It's more comfortable for the patients.
The changes, which will be felt most strongly by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those that have many patients in one room, one toilet on the first floor, unflattering beds, tight windows, and poor working conditions for health workers.
"Our boarding house, for example, was built thirty-five years ago and is now at the end of its life", noted Pavel Calabek, director of the Zlín Hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected to the emergency room.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, plus new facilities.
The same model has already half finished the Hungarian Castle.
The central revenue is already up and in three years, he'll have an intern.
"We will pay for the building with a loan and partly with our own funds", explained the director, Petr Sládek.
This is the only hospital in the county that can afford to pay for itself.
It's still the highest profit-making company in the world and it didn't lose money until two years ago when the Zlín hospital was losing almost $200 million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase revenues and manage costs efficiently throughout the hospital", said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of economics.
Patients at the outer hospital will also see improvement.
Over the next 10 to 15 years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new equipment and reconstruction.
The seizure station will be repaired this year, then the dialysis facility will be added, or a new MRI building will be built.

No one explained to me how to keep the refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
After talks with his European colleagues, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to adopt refugee quota allocations, but refuse to discuss them.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the refugees assigned to the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive a response, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text", Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you took at the meeting of the EU's interior and foreign ministers?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas as a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings that have visions, they're going somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they are redistributed.
We can't imagine that.
We have not received a reply and therefore we wanted quotas to be removed from the final text.
With the other conclusions -- functional hotspots, so registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We were dealing with 40,000 a while ago, now we're dealing with 120,000.
When will it be 500 grand?
And how do we keep these people in the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through here want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who are seeking asylum in the Czech Republic, have ambitions to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is, from Syria and other countries, is almost zero.
You mentioned that we don't want refugees, but we've already committed to taking in 1,500.
Couldn't more be received this way?
We've committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on one condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that 1,100 people are coming to us to handle the asylum procedure.
They come to our detention facility, and we treat them the same as the ones we intercept.
It's a big question, and we're going to debate it with Europe, whether we can detain people who are registered in Italy and Greece, possibly Hungary.
Because Europe's way of doing it is if they have a license, they can't be detained.
That is, they come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet, it may happen that we do not even keep the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave again to that Germany after arriving.
If we can hold them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we'll handle the asylum procedure.
If it's Syrians, Eritreans, almost 98 percent of them, according to European statistics, are getting international protection.
Then they get papers that allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there's 400 people who will be relocated.
This is the second project that we're running, and the only progress we've made is in discussing with the churches about whether they can help them get jobs, housing, and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting, the other countries were not willing to discuss with us.
But isn't it true that the Czech Republic is simply rejecting quotas, but not offering any solidarity steps to block the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is supposed to be a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany issues an incentive that all Syrian migrants can join them, the news will spread within hours to all the camps across Europe, but also to Turkey, Jordan.
It's driving another wave of migration to Germany because they just don't want to come to us.
We think the way forward is to protect the external borders -- just to deter those migratory waves, help those in need, and isolate economic migrants.
Clearly let them know they don't stand a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany last year alone.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's office.
If we could separate them and not take them in or take them in only according to the needs of the economy, then 50 percent of what social systems waste on them today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of detentions in the Czech Republic has jumped.
He's 80 now, 12 the first day.
How far is it going to go to tighten border controls?
We were afraid of being caught in the middle of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred openings in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We're doing this by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, Hungary is complicated and the Greeks - it's a completely useless story.
So where's the tipping point?
Does it have to be like a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day for two, three days in a row, they're draining our capacity enough to trigger emergency plans.
Then I've arranged with the Prime Minister to call an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in touch several times a day.
If that were to happen, the government could de facto sit down immediately and, with a resolution, decide to increase the police force by an army, let's say, the customs service, or possibly the prison service.
The extreme is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can get that far.
You realize that our position is different, we are a nation state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen on Czech territory, I don't want to spread alarmist information.
All the information we have, whether it's from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a big chunk of her debt at the last minute.
He's trying to avoid going bankrupt.
Football Slavia has paid off its debts.
Football players were getting their money's worth.
Football Slavia appeared in court for the first time on Tuesday in the bankruptcy proceedings.
Almost three months after a proposal for about 20 million crowns was submitted by Online Services in Pacific Samoa.
Slavia's lawyer, Zuzana Mládková, tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzlova within hours not to declare her bankrupt.
And I must say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week the new owner of Slavie was a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, the new owners brought money to the club at the last minute.
This is also proven by Slavie's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the mountain club on Monday, just a day before the court hearing, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15", said lawyer Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the former Slovak representative Milan Ivanov or the Czech midfielder Maria Lička.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club paid the fees owed to the city of Prague 10.
The only de facto part of the insolvency proceedings thus remains the claims which Slavie disputes.
The club claims that the commitments were not made at all or are being litigated.
However, we are prepared to pay the sums if these disputes are lost.
"We have the necessary funds on our bank account, which we can prove by an extract from the account", lawyer Mládková told the judge.
'Everything that was past due is paid,' Mládková stated, adding that only unpaid or conflicting liabilities remain.
It is also certain that the judge will not rule in the coming days and the trial will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed proof that she had indeed paid the debt.
All the evidence will then be evaluated.
A decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the trial to resume on November 3.
However, the decision will not be taken at this meeting either, but only in writing afterwards.

The FastMig X is the representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technology, hardware and software integrated into the modular design brings benefits and a rapid return on investment in terms of high quality, productivity and reliability.
The FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured to the customer's requirements.
And we're doing it in any kind of way, from structural steel to special alloys to coarse materials to thin sheet metal, from workshop applications to shipyard welding.
The incredible number of welding curves, the ease of setting and the expandability of the welding source allow it to react quickly to changing requirements, leading to reduced downtime, the need to reconfigure the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X allows welding with state-of-the-art welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
Time is not wasted, and there is no waste of materials or repairing faulty joints.
It provides flexibility, less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It's this year's first feature, premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We value these honors highly, as they confirm the product's exceptional quality.
The world's leading manufacturers may boast similar systems, but the difference in software and control parameters makes the FastMig X a world leader.
The delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly pleasant for the interested parties.
We have already established our first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly spread after the Brno fair.
We have been regular participants for over 20 years and our business results are almost always better than before", emphasises Miroslav Streichsbier, manager of Kemppi's store in Pilsen, for ARC-H.
The FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured to the customer's requirements.
The blanket could be built to keep it from falling.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
The expert says the blanket could have been hit more safely.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built to avoid two landslides in Prague's Stromovka, says Alexandr Butovič, the production manager of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel.
He said that Wednesday night at a press tour of the tunnel.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion more expensive.
It's open to drivers Saturday afternoon.
It's always a trade-off between price and safety.
"The tunnel could be dug more safely, but the costs are rising exponentially", Butovic said.
He said the conditions in Stromovka were the same all along, yet the ground was only a few steps from where he started to strike with a safer and more careful method.
"If the measures had been taken 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have cost half a billion more", Butovic said.
The Blanca Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the Metrostav company, Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
The original plan called for a construction cost of 17 billion crowns.
If you add in the VAT, which has doubled since the building, you have 21 of the 17 billion.
If you add technology, land purchases and engineering, valuation and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37 billion, said Whitehead.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system with the new Apple update
A new operating system can be requested in Settings by clicking the General tab and selecting Software Update.
When ready, it will offer you the option to download and then install your phone.
Some users have experienced a problem after installation, specifically the error message Software update failed.
One solution to this problem is to wait until the interest in the update wanes, or try iTunes.
The phone will walk you through the update process.
This includes the need to uninstall apps to free up space - but this will not be necessary, because Apple has shortened the update and also made the whole process easier by using a special tool that suggests apps to the user to delete and reinstall after the update is over.
Make sure your phone is charged before you run the update.
If the battery is low, Apple will not allow the update to run, as interrupting the process could cause an update error.
Other news: iOS 9 release not delayed despite WatchOS delay; iOS 9 reviews: exciting updates to new operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of new iPhone operating system
Make sure you go through our list of things to do before you update, things to try, and things to avoid or protect yourself from. iOS 9 will introduce new features, including an even smarter personal assistant and a wide range of creative features for iPad, as well as many patches to speed up and fix the operating system.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures at issue in the present case are not imputable to the State.
FedEx reported disappointing quarterly results and a huge decrease in its full-year earnings forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it planned to hire around 55 000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, a 20 cent decline from its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The downgraded outlook comes despite an average interest rate hike of 4.9 percent, which will be reflected in January, and higher overhead charges for heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said that it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The company's Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company had 'performed solidly despite weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade.'
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 more workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 down from $2.44 per share predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks Company were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected by the decline in priority international shipping in recent years, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the FedEx ground unit's performance.
In the last quarter, land revenue increased by 29%, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher basic rates, while profit decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They finished Tuesday with an 11 percent drop year-over-year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table to decide if, after nearly a decade, it's time to raise the key interest rate.
Soaring above them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Fed has a double mandate from Congress: to maximize American employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X factor in too close to a predictable decision to be announced on Thursday about whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch on the brink of unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since late 2008.
While most data shows solid economic growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to the volatility by raising its federal funds rate benchmark - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"It's clear that the job market and inflation will be the first and foremost thing to watch", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient reason to wait", she said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is a cause for nervousness in financial markets.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with the key indicator only about a 30% chance of a raise.
That would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, only if politicians soften the fall by promising that another hike is out of the question.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep rates quiet this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now", he says.
If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to the extreme in their policy statement and hold the financial markets in their hands to prevent panic".
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets by removing uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects to see rate increases through the spring and early summer this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has shown solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of rising.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can and needs to cope with higher rates given the tightness of the labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to slide late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors worried that a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of its May high.
The volatile market situation gives Fed policymakers a complex calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what's happened in financial markets, and reports of weakness in the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be tightening at this meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the fallout.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on on the latest developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be included in their decision making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence over the last few years has been enormous.
The mere hint of then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "narrow" their monetary expansion in the marketplace triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, it is to be expected that Fed officials will monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., remarked this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerating movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy-making staff who pushed for rate increases, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over three sessions "despite limited identifiable effects on U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed the cuts.
The Fed should prioritize financial stability concerns only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest surge is nowhere near that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because the markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and it doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's Chinatown, not Thai.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop offering a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an auto part if you need a little motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to walk through all the alleys.
If you're hungry from all the shopping, go grab a bite to eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The indoor trading post (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in stock: do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it at LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many are sold in bulk.
The range of fresh products includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and others.
The meat distribution is great, fish for example - the staff at the counter will wash and boil it for you, even fry it for you if you wish,
A good portion of the store is left to the massive freezer section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products, and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide alleys lead to shopping carts and forklifts.
Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register.
Location: The store is in an industrial area of Los Angeles, surrounding the Chinatown suburbs and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Speed on the freeways stays the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h has been rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways, the maximum speed may not be increased to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House passed an amendment to the Senate bill, which rejected the speed bump.
The amendment to the Land Transportation Act is now headed to the president.
President Milos Zeman said in late April that he would veto a law allowing speeds of 150 kilometers per hour.
The increase was opposed by Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for ANO), who said that the Czech motorway network is not yet built at such a speed.
The Senate version of the bill was approved by the House of Representatives on Tuesday.
The approved amendment will now allow the speed to be increased from 90 to 110 km/h on selected first class roads, in particular four-lane ones, in line with the original government proposal.
The House first extended this option to motorways, allowing speeds of up to 150 km/h on selected sections, but the Senate rejected it.
The Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The Senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed from the amendment the authority of the traffic police to have the final say in the modification of local roads, which are maintained by the municipality.
The Senate version approved by the House also provides for sewerage, water pipes or public lighting cables to be laid longitudinally under the road surface.
It would save the city on land purchases.
The municipality should also not be obliged to take care of the road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road safety and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles that are not reported by owners.
New municipalities could sell towed vehicles that are not reported to their owners within six months of the notification of the withdrawal.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory on second and third class roads under penalty of fines also for freight forwarders.
The amendment also removes the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of the current paper ones, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
The government says it'll save money on the electronic system.
The mouthpiece is going to court.
He's facing 10 years for over-expensive citizens' greetings.
The case involves an allegedly overpriced Welcome to Citizens project.
Police wanted to prosecute Zuzana Kailova (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not release her.
According to the legal classification of the case, they both face up to ten years in prison.
The main hearing is currently scheduled for October 2nd.
According to the prosecutor, Mandík and Macik caused at least one million crowns in damage, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, former members of the city administration, in the exercise of their functions, unlawfully enabled the company that organized the reception to benefit financially.
The indictment alleges that Mandyk ordered the then head of the Magistrates' Department of Municipal Services, Education and Culture to contact five related companies in a tender procedure.
When another company entered the competition with the lowest price, the city council cancelled the competition.
The city then had to entrust the contract to the administrator, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
The charges, aimed at securing the award of a public contract for Darothore to host the 'Welcome to the City' event in the Isthmus of Labrador, were at least in breach of the requirement of due diligence, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, they were aware that, once the contract had been awarded, Darothore would subsequently charge the Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome to Citizens' Meeting a price that would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company collected more than CZK 5 million for the project, according to the file.
The city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then withdrew from the contract.
The expert opinion concluded that the amount paid was overpriced by at least CZK 1 million.
Mandyk has previously denied any violation of the law.
I have committed no crime. I am innocent.
I don't understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, adding that the city under his leadership was just building on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was organised by the Roxy II Agency.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money", added Mandík.
Forensics was originally going to charge Congresswoman Kail, who was also a city council member.
But the House of Representatives didn't prosecute her.
So the prosecutors have dropped the case, but they expect to charge Kail after her term ends.
The welcoming of citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for $5,000 to buy baby supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly let a dog out on the fugitive.
Then they made the press delete the tape.
Hungarian police briefly detained an AP cameraman at the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a video of a police dog allegedly running a refugee over the ground.
The Hungarian government disputes this claim.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border into Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The police intervened and one of them let a Syrian man be attacked by a dog with a basket on its cheek.
The dog of a man who was shouting "Please, please, I'm a refugee" spilled, Muzi said.
One of the officers noticed that Muzi was filming everything and didn't let him leave.
The reporter was then prohibited from calling his superiors or colleagues on the ground.
The officers took Muzi to a dark spot near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the recording.
Muzi lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt he was in danger because of the dogs around.
The Associated Press sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police's behavior unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and without fear of the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kovács, referring to the police report, questioned Muzi's account of the events.
He said the cops just wanted the reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't make him delete anything.
"Dogs may bark - they are trained to scare and scare a little, but they certainly didn't attack", says Kovács.
The unpredictable Champions League.
Winning against City will kick us, Juventus believes
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose", said Manuel Pellegrini, City's coach.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team created many chances, but we had the ball longer on the sidelines.
"The reason for the defeat was not tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals", said Pellegrini, whose team won the competition after 636 minutes.
Last season's finalist Juventus was in the exact opposite situation before the match - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only one point as the defending champion and with a score of 2:4 is only in 16th place of the table.
That's why the turn at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us up", believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supporters before the new season - Pirlo, Tevez and Vidal.
In Manchester, they were represented by Pogba, Manjukić and Morato.
"It's true, this victory is very important, hopefully it will help us ride the winning wave", Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attack phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
"We could have scored 0-2 before our equaliser, but Gianluigi supported us", said Allegri's coach, Buffon.
"We've burned a few good chances", lamented City midfielder Yaya Touré.
We have to learn from the Champions League and try to do better next time.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye to the old Germany II.
Before we continue on the immigration issue, we should realize that all this media hype around it is being run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of little children being carried by their parents on the dusty roads of exodus.
And that automatically creates in a person -- in a European person -- a feeling of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't just come here desperate little kids, notice on the footage of the boats landing on the Greek islands, there's not much of a baby on them!
And somehow, recently, we've lost sight of the images of boats heading for Lampedusa, refugees at the French border at Menton, where thousands of young men lie on the beautiful promenade.
Mostly young black people.
And the pictures of Callais are gone, too, where these black men are eating and waiting to see if they can get through the Channel Tunnel.
I guess he doesn't care anymore.
Even the pictures of the early Christian church of Eritrea have not impressed Europeans.
Too much of it was a fake.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of a cover-up that it's not just the unfortunate little Syrian kids, but also the stylish -- for older people: fashion-conscious -- young men.
Their muscles look like they just came out of a gym.
And just one personal experience.
This summer in the Turkish-Muslim part of Cyprus, we were lying on a hotel's private beach.
Despite being private, a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no ham.
And out of them came young black men.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They walked onto the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes, holding, as usual, smartphones.
They didn't care that it was a private beach, and the staff - Turks, Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the couches.
If you weren't on it and you were in the sea, you were unlucky.
They were dressed like American rappers in a movie.
Nail caps on their heads, white and colored adidas on their feet.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started feasting.
They've got tables all around them, stuffed up next to the brown and white bar-guests - reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining room terrace to a quiet place.
The new black guys were drinking beer straight out of the third-party bottle - like on a soap opera?! - and throwing empty bottles around on the beach.
They kept yelling at each other.
It wasn't in English.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - screamed and screamed in the water, mothers and children and pensioners ran away in terror, and within half an hour not a single non-black guest was on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Whether one was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff was afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a half-voice that night, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah", I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it at work", said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everybody had a massive gold chain around their neck.
And one had a massive gold cross about eight inches [20 cm] around his neck.
And women were like gold.
"Are these drug dealers?" I asked.
"You saw them drinking", the waiter replied.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
But in June of 2105, it wasn't that important to me.
I had no idea what was coming.
But the secret service and the top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they don't know.
About 1.5 million immigrants made their way to Europe during that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, it turns out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian politically correct politicians, like intellectuals and their associated lobbyists and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now the publicly recognised major power in Europe - are lying, lying and lying - but not only they, but also the top of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on par with those shown on Moscow television in August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunflowers at the station, but mostly - Old Germans - Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For weeks, the news on Czech television has been talking about how, according to a survey, Germans are almost all in favor of immigrants.
But anyone who's been to Germany for a few days knows that's a lie.
Which is confirmed by other information.
For example, a famous public opinion poll organized by ARD - the Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, just a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
That's what our TVs said.
But they kept secret what had broken out in Germany the next day: that a poll of 67,000 people showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted immigrants.
True, Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago, that "our effort to create a 'multi-cultural society' has failed utterly".
She went on to say: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society".
"All attempts to coexist have failed utterly".
In a country of four million Muslims, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has failed, because today they live with us and we have been fooling ourselves for some time that they will not stay, that they will one day disappear again.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we tell ourselves we're just living happily ever after, that approach has failed.
He failed completely.
But Merkel doesn't seem to have the strength to go against the powers that be in Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is escalating rapidly.
The Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, SPD Member of Parliament, the only one in the European Parliament who allegedly has not even a diploma - yes, this is the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play the watchman in a concentration camp from the minute - has shown himself as he has on several occasions.
It seems, especially under the impression of the recent statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubik's Cube.
Notice that with the exception of a few, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who have spent years, at least on the outside, trying to come to terms with their horrible past as aggressors and killers of millions?
Is it true that in the soul of Germany is a devil of aggression, superiority and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right to use all his might to stop the Great Germans from taking over the whole of central Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was decommissioned, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, is likely to return in another form.
After the attempt of the Marxists to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany based on, for example, ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
We'd say sunny.
The German elite had long resisted the rise of German nationalism, and so they left alone all those anti-nuclear fighters, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people all over the world who want to do something different and better, they have completely sided with the global warming fighters, shut down nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current in this current that considers all Slavs to be a difficult subject - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after his Jewish parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the recent statements of Schulz and German ministers openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which must be obeyed without reservation.
Otherwise, you're in trouble!
And when you add in the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, you have what you have.
And behind it, as always, is capital, especially German, which is satisfied and who is fed up with the fact that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The sunflowers' pseudo-belief first led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism and today has brought them home and will bring perhaps millions of Muslims.
Which, lured by the siren voices, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see and start rioting.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours with force again, and once again a part of its population - but it seems that a smaller and smaller part - can become ideologically delusional, but in the end reality will catch up with it as always.
Is Germany going to burn again?
The Muslim hostels are already on fire.
What will the German government do when public protests erupt in Germany against the incoming Islamists?
To whom will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time but who have certainly not been assimilated into the local customs and laws come to help?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans who are afraid of Islamizing their country are drawn into it?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superman Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that has been created in Europe by the support of the sunshine ideology, that is, the ideology of the elitist and basically totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the rude treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all their inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it cannot go well.
Finished tomorrow.
Best way to get rid of the intruding salesmen is to scare them to death.
You knock and a sturdy knock comes at you in a way that the weaker nature may not be able to resist.
The animated head will sweep you away, and the drunken will be driven away, accompanied (or rather driven away) by the persistent salesman and the animated statue.
Maybe it's a shame you can't get a talking knocker in the real world.
We could use a little help keeping out a lot of the pricks and the scum.
The name of the product shall be indicated in the following way:
A small weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it's in the outdoor tile near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that is a kind of expansive weed but looks pretty good when it comes to blooming.
It's in the outdoor tile.
She's unpredictable, she's doing well in our garden.
It likes dry environments, is adaptable, modest, and unpretentious.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it's worth watching and taking pictures of.
Beneath the detail lies the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves, also with purple undertones.
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes a healthy diet during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to teach women about the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding by using images of babies suckling on a painted picture of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic makeup of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets have also been shown to negatively affect a child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, although Nine's is trying to take the lead on the Today Show.
The flight of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the costs of the Liberal leadership's escape failed to generate a sufficient rating boost for Today.
The morning show Nine airs from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull is ousted by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The tyranny of distance did not seem to matter much to the viewers of Aussie TV, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities compared to 330,000 for Today.
Today saw a slight increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling a void in Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise averaged 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning on more than just Parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

Big news for Seven was a stunning 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to a coastal area of New Zealand averages a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson alone could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The outcome of last night is a clear "yes".
Seven's The X Factor maintained a strong 1.136 million viewers, smoothly beating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven has recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz show (5:00 to 5:30 p.m.), hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 5:30 to 6:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers, which was enough to give him a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
With the ratings of The Chase Australia dropping from the second night, the Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat at 5:30 is finally going to win.
The Chase Australia is being replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three finalists agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
The secret is out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who won The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood is coming to Bachelor with is shrouded in insurmountable secrecy.
And the three girls who stay standing will definitely not reveal who the real one is who will get the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before, with only two left, they unwittingly told us who was going to win.
Sam Wood is holding his tongue for Thursday's final.
All three women lyrically sang about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler as to who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jevons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the one who would be the best match for Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since day one.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible, and I still think so throughout the course", says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a very down-to-earth woman, she's a lot of fun", added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They're happy and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and you could make a great couple.
She claims that during his last visits to her home, she realized that Wood might be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I had opened my heart to him", she adds.
I asked Wood who he'd pick if it wasn't her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say", she said.
I like both girls equally - it's a tie between Snezen and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options for where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown a lot of interest in his move to the United States and many teams have questioned his great start to training late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a wise decision.
Some coaches have suspended Hayne for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was made by an Australian rugby league convert on the first pitch of Tuesday's 3-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had faith in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne at the post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and just focus on the next game.
Already in the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing while mistakenly leaving the field and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he had a worse start to his NFL career than he could have imagined.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the foul to his original 2007 debut, when a home run led to a Queensland three.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo of himself with fans holding the Australian flag after the game on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun at his head on a Siberian runway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The U.S. has taken up the cause of immigrants who demanded restitution for their property.
The twins emigrated in 1984 and their property was taken over by a new owner.
After 1989, the couple could no longer return the property, so they applied to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the amount they had requested, over CZK 2.8 million, but the court of appeal changed their claim to less than CZK 90,000, citing the fact that the amount of compensation is determined by the 1991 price regulations.
The Supreme Court sided with the emigrants and awarded them the amount originally sought.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the IRS with a complaint.
In the meantime, the social and economic situation has changed to such an extent that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time, although it was adequate for the property taken, is now only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot be seen as a burden on the parties involved in the restitution of the beneficiaries who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to claim compensation earlier", explained Judge Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the Tribunal sided with the emigrants.
'The SC has repeatedly ruled that the ordinary courts should proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the persons entitled and that the purpose of restitution legislation, namely to make good the property damage caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved,' the judge added.
Evita is now played by Radka Fisarová in the musical Studio DVA.
Radka Fišarová became the world's youngest Evita when, in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech production of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Timea Rice at the Prague Spirála Theatre.
Regarding returning to the same role, he says, "To this day, the challenge of Evita has not been matched by many performances".
Evita is not only a wonderful role, it's also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monica Absolon for the role of First Lady of Argentina.
I saw Moncha in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
I suddenly saw a whole new concept here.
I'm all for more modern adaptations, but this one's just particularly well done.
"The direction of Ondrej Sokola is original, light and contemporary", says Fišarová.
The handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at the Monika Absolonova Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 pm in the Studio DVA theater.
The evening will culminate with a musical piece from Evita.
The experience will certainly include the duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also step off the director's desk, when he replaces Karl Roden as President Perón during the filming of the film.

Four people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters against a proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's chief officer, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under a proposed new constitution, dampening their political clout.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which demands the establishment of its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 policemen.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces  a big step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers in Kathmandu voted this week on provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We can't panic now.
After losing on ice to champion Litvínov, you couldn't even manage a home duel with the Spartans (3-5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry into the big leagues as last year?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

NHC predicts a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands.
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, a Miami-based weather forecaster said.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google announced this on their blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted the story on her blog based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear", Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with Europe's migrant crisis worsening, more and more families like mine are willing to help.
All donations will be distributed to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all donations made through google.com/refugeerelief to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, ravaged by four years of war that has displaced four million people this year alone.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For moderately obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to tell whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight-loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data take a long time to come across", says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight-loss surgery who wrote the editorial for a new JAMA surgery study.
Weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, they use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most research has been done on morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and gastrectomy -- in the treatment of type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study found that the average BMI of those who underwent the surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who had not received surgery for diabetes remained about the same at 29.
Among the patients who had surgery, 36 percent of the diabetes was completely resolved and 28 percent partially.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and partially resolved in only about 2 percent of patients for comparison.
Furthermore, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol was shown to be "generally better in the surgical group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient' s hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect the ongoing blood sugar level in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, say researchers.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medication group, this remained at about 8 percent.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery.
After five years, the bypass group lost more weight compared with the gastrectomy group (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), had greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs. 2.1 percent), and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs. 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of surviving the next 15 years than the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone said it is a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where this work is critical, because it shows that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also says that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously once a patient's BMI drops between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to let people know how serious the situation is", he says.
I think once you accumulate these genetic changes that tie their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the road back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe". - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on the study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under present circumstances, the interests of mankind should be put ahead of the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a few thousand refugees, but in the meantime you have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through education in these Muslim countries", he stressed.
Ultimately, we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the prosecutions of George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the violent response of the US has triggered a chain of events beyond our control.
After 9/11, I wrote a letter of condolence to President Bush, advising him that the way to solve this problem was not through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in children who ingested sanitary agent in the last four years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed high-alcohol sanitary pads, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of sanitary products ingested by children under 12 years of age who were reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more access to these products and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink toilet paper on purpose, while others do so to impress their friends or as a social media challenge.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking toilet paper for the cheap noise.
The teenagers allegedly mixed sanitary pads with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scent of the remedy.
"Children don't think about the harm", Lopez said.
A lot more attractive are the ones that are perfumed.
Strawberry, grapefruit, or orange-scented sanitary napkins are also available, which are very appealing to children.
Sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few loops can indicate alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey lying around, but people leave these sanitary pads outside, and when kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested four pints of strawberry-scented sanitary agent at her school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold for adult intoxication, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was speaking in a blurred voice and unable to walk after arriving at the ER.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary", said CNN's Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could have been fatal to my baby.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or keep sanitary products out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitary products have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing sanitary pads that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The medical community believed that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to poison their "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary products and has banned their presence in the room.
Police deemed the foiled plan "innocent gossip", citing the discipline of the school district,
Fame: no mismatch in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays the talk of discord at Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he's going to turn it around again.
Hearts will be battling the SFA against an attack on Nelson and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
The Dons increase their lead over Celtic by five points.
A first-half penalty from Adam Rooney gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies any talk of a discrepancy.
This situation has sparked rumours of a disagreement at Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased oversight in preparation for the match against the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're under pressure. I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of Scottish title rivalry is boring the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer a title rivalry between them.
De Boer, who is currently an ambassador for Ajax, states: "They no longer show the best of Celtic's games in the Netherlands, and why?"
Because there are no more Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement at the Old Firm games, and it's not just the people of Scotland who watch these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Dale is committed.
Dealia admitted Celtic were a bit off, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
The defeat of Malmö and subsequent relegation from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat to Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now sit at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic have had bad times and they're going to rise again".
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what's happening.
We're in exactly the same situation - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players so much better.
It's very important to stay together now.
Warburton is concerned about January reinforcements.
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago suggesting he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about the huge buy-in and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
A former Brentford boss says: "The winter transfer window is very different from the summer".
Players who come in the summer have the entire preseason to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage can be done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic's transfer target Michu suggests retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire when his contract with Swansea expires.
The 20-year-old shooter has been suffering from a fractured ankle for two years and has been unable to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 as Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later revoked - the third red card issued by referee Collum to be revoked.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance".
Griffiths has pledged to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after he admitted to singing a song with lyrics addressed to former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a heated moment", the striker said, adding: "I can safely say I will not return to Tynecastle if it is not in a Celtic shirt".
The Tannadice council believes in the Dundee United-Donnellys deal.
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in correcting the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys back in action", Donnelly promises.
McInnes is happy for his "ugly win" over Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to win their seventh league title in a row and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a first-half penalty from Adam Rooney.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning these types of games".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while overall unemployment in the UK is rising
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total unemployment rate in the UK rose by 10 000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland of 5.9 per cent was above the UK rate of 5.5 per cent, as shown by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12 000 over a three-month period, and the number of workers has now stopped at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the British average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scotland's Secretary of State David Mundell said: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In the last 12 months, we have seen further improvement in the labour market and Scottish employment has risen while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witnessed the Oklahoma Execution
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the execution of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As that day approaches, I'm beginning to worry.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to cover executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, there is a morbid lottery to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for reporters from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the execution with an open mind.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've forged a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a reporter at the same time, so I won't have a notepad leave and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm just gonna have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better", but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter who's on the ground ready to tell the story.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help the death penalty proceedings.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be at my side.
For more information on the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I've created.
I'm not gonna go over all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have made him guilty of being an accessory to a felony.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I strongly believe that not enough evidence has been presented to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you're getting from me is the experience of seeing a person I love die a needless death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase.
Officer Canning Vale was left dry after rescuing a man from Canning River.
A bet made by a Peterman man to flee from the police failed after he got into shallow muddy water just metres from a policeman who tried to persuade him to return to shore.
Canning Vale Police were called to the incident extending into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by running across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and repeating, 'I'm not going out, just come get me,'" said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried a safer tactic, police negotiation".
"People sometimes try to do funny things on the run", said Castledine.
Football champion Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to shut down the races.
Peeter Moody has accused the organisers of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the organizers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, based on the belief that they were running a personal campaign against him with the late-night scratching of Lady Tatay during maintenance on race day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation with Lidari's positive cobalt wipe, which he can't explain.
He was biting his tongue about being accused of spying for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes".
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for so long, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you all at once", Moody said.
They know it's over.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I'd have to consider what to do with my license after that.
Earlier, Moody had released a bombshell in his interview with racing.com that the integrity department was trying to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables in exchange for information about things that were going on in my stables", Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because they've been completely burned trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Am I supposed to think this is getting personal?
RVL grow a few balls and get people outside of coaching positions to take responsibility for what's happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm about to say will give them something to think about.
But I've reached a point where it doesn't matter anymore, and I'm sad.
It really made me sad.
I'm going to push and pull them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels have increased with a long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari, and recent scratches on his back have raised the feeling that he could "put his license on the table".
Mood, best known for preparing undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on race day "ridiculous" after the horse was covered in mud or clay on his legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for it", he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody faced a three-month suspension for treating the upholstery on race day, which the organizers have already opened an investigation into.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The Cobram driver who escaped was arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and drove off.
A cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorcyclist drove off without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to Shepparton police.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop in an accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy returns the hit to rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach of the Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of his players as "setting the agenda" for the two NRL premiership favourites.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed the Storm's players to "wrestle" his players during the Storm's controversial win in the Sydney qualifiers on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark about Strorm after his team won the final of the qualifiers over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "showcase" of rugby league and saying the two from Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' interventions, saying they focused on "contact".
Bellamy added that the situation had boosted his confidence because his team was being criticized by two head coaches, which could mean they were afraid of losing to the Storm.
"It keeps coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2", he said Wednesday in Bellamy.
I can guarantee you that we haven't changed anything in our defensive system and techniques in the last year, but the last few weeks have been all about contact during surgery, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been here three years and obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which may have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like this always come up this time of year.
Bellamy dismissed Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his game on Saturday was as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting", Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George were being criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds canceled, especially his young quarterbacks with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd want to play if you had that kind of player.
He made that point in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two quarterbacks like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me feel more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that the Storm and Roosters had more goals scored than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was probably good, I didn't watch, but what's the score?
Our game ended 20-18, we had two more shots in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or is the break and the no-scoring the interesting thing?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again at some point.
The Storm are on break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park.
Serbian man has been granted $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drugs from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with his co-defendants at the dock during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial-grade cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer based his defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he possessed the full amount and that he could have been in the cafe entirely by accident and innocently.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan thought Maksimovic would have escaped.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he told the court on Wednesday.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather have jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, as the defendant did not appear in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to obtain child abuse photos.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged onto her online chat room, where he had a bunch of indecent photos of kids that another user had sent him.
The girl then woke up and discovered that her phone was missing, and then found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She went through it and before she could tell her mother, she found some disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photographs, then the analytics computers tracked down the address and found a "disturbing" web search using terms for looking for indecent images of children.
Hogg then told police officers that his reason was to "put pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a police officer and scaring them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted he was the one who was doing the computer searches, but he claims he was just pretending to be a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He claims he flipped out drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rapes and murders.
"When the girl found the messages on her phone", adds Robertson, "she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and the defendant was confronted afterwards.
The girl was interviewed and spoke about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to one count of receiving or distributing indecent images of children on June 14 last year, violated his bail on January 25 and failed to appear in court for his arraignment on March 24 this year.
Defence counsel Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offender list because he can argue that there was "no substantial sexual implication" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed sentencing until October due to a report from a social worker.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was remanded in custody pending a hearing on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offender registry before his sentencing date.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe made a bad speech in the Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but a video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by opposition lawmakers' claims of receiving anonymous death threats warning them against yelling at Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his State of the Union address to parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the MDC parliamentary club, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't show up but is called 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned to know that their immunity ends in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer in effect.
The chief said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai had "concerns" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is about to cut its workforce by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cutting between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save costs on business services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating its PC and printer business from its faster-growing hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of approximately $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive and sustainable spending structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", says Meg Whitman, HP's CEO and chairman, who will lead the unit after the split.
"The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to a new business style", Whitman said.
As a separate company, we'll be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion, the company said, and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This would bring about the dissolution of a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a manufacturer of electrical equipment whose Palo Alto garage was dubbed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to handle the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC maker and one of the largest technology companies in America, is the latest in a sector based on the belief that a tightly specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it's still September and if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there's no reason he can't play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from a historical perspective, his involvement in the next summer's European Championships is obviously uncertain.
The big downside to this latest problem is that Wilshere finished last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back to his old form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a career-threatening injury", Wenger says.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's not that big of a deal.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he suffered before.
That might be true from a purely medical perspective, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
And here, too, an unpleasant pattern is emerging.
A survey by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries Wilshere has sustained since making his debut six years ago.
Over the last five years, he's played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games:
From a wider perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of two Premier League clubs to miss the most days due to injury.
Wenger is embracing the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in injuries recorded over the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition", Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it does, and he has the career he deserves.
Arsenal begin the Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to take over.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal's Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe", says Wenger.
While Arsenal are the clear favourites to progress from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for being the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
The Dynamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after holding an unbeaten campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by a 3.2 magnitude earthquake Wednesday night.
It was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and he's still far from leading the club to their first European Cup victory.
"This effort is enormous", says Wenger.
It's never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us some serious lessons about male friendship.
The absence of similar depictions in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperately than ever before about suicides among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
At the heart of this struggle lies the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression found that if the affected person had a high enough percentage of friends with "a healthy mood", their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends is half the risk of developing mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be attainable.
In this social media communication with an emphasis on style rather than content, immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even when we're actually more isolated.
This superficial success is driven by what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status -- all at the expense of our true values -- our personal desire for growth and friendship -- which have profound effects on our mental health.
And as a billionaire and game designer recently explained, money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victimization, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the realization that yes, men can relate, too, though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, "...my role as a listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference".
The men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with their friends.
The old saying "deal with it" is strong in the sense that you'll be perceived as weak to open up about your problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer a more long-term compensation mechanism.
It highlights the little moments in male friendship.
As far as my job is concerned, the outsider status on the phone helps people in times of desperation, but long-term support needs to come from a larger circle of friends and family.
So if you're going to Comedy Central's FrendsFest this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
The Friends series will be aired on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG to knock Malmo out
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG beat Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League journey with a final comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut and this player sent the French champions PSG to victory, but then they threw away several chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only focused on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their quarter-final path, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 seasons.
But even though they scored three points, it was not a classic performance for Laurent Blanc's team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a waste in front of goal and was later substituted against his home team and the club where he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League away or at home, so a 2-0 win is a problem for our opponents and looking comfortable in defence is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve as the season progresses", said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, but I still regret not scoring one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to PSG's squad that suffered a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 this weekend, but was overshadowed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger has been touted as the man who will take PSG to new heights in Europe following his move from Manchester United last month and showed why when he ran to a pass from Marco Verratti for Malmo's defence and sent a beautiful finish behind Johan Wiland into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected this to kick off a spectacular PSG victory, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage, entered with nine internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders and two midfielders were a tough opponent.
But aside from Nikola Djurdice's shot that just missed Kevin Trapp's long corner in the 34th minute, there wasn't much to offer in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with poor passing and a miserable finish, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to score five times in the first half and was then disappointed as his shot came into the net shortly after the start of the second half Cavani.
However, he proved much more suitable when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a spin shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who sent his sixth goal of the season behind the line with a header after Ibrahimovic gave him a pass from Maxwell's left wing.
This ended Malm's thoughts of the possibility of getting something out of the match, and only Wiland's excellent close-up shot shattered David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even as substitute Ezekiel Lavezzi's goal was not recognised at the end of the match.
Malmo manager Age Hareide admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last Champions League game was last December".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches aren't enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a thrilling match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion selling shares
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by a collapse in commodity prices, made $2.5 billion on Wednesday from a stock sale as part of its massive debt relief plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with commodity price volatility as China's economic slowdown dampens demand and ignites sparks of doom across the market.
Rights issues sent Glencore's stock price to its peak in the London stock market in early morning trading on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 Index, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion stock sale is part of a broader plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold new shares at 123 pence a share, which was a 2.4 percent discount from Tuesday's closing price.
They have divested themselves of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the prolongation of the slowdown in Chinese growth have cut the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House has confirmed that Xi Jinping has visited Washington.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States later this month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner after the talks.
President Xi's visit provides an opportunity to strengthen US-China relations, encourage cooperation in addressing issues of international, regional and common interest, and provide an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two countries, the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is due to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US technical leaders en route to Washington, before continuing to New York for the UN meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
The German distress beacon, far from disrupting the European crew, is forcing the ship to change course, reports the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece - than argue over a future allocation of refugees by quota based on numbers that are increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to reallocate 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of member states have changed their priorities.
Before we can look at the final destination of refugees, we need to filter out those who are already arriving today and decide the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
'Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to managing migration,' stresses the text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday.
After the single currency crisis, the EU is finding itself in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but they're not losing their resolve and increasing the pressure.
It is reinstating border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the flow of asylum seekers into that country.
The central power makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday was already evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering it, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has done this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
It's a domino effect, but the blind can see.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already crossed into the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière discussed the issue intensively in private with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This is not a new idea, but it is being implemented with reluctance.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to establish any point of entry into its territory because it fears more than anyone else that it will have camps to house the refugees at its expense.
The real black hole is still Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands off the Turkish coast this year, more than twice the number who have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are actual asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after going through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a giant gaping hole.
Athens, still in financial ruin and waiting for a new government, has folded its hands.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of common concern now for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The Juncker Commission has promised to set up checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given a number or a date.
'The challenges facing Greece are Europe-wide,' EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
The European Union's Frontex border control agency is deployed in the country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
'Adequate financial resources will be needed,' warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
In legal terms, they will continue to have the final say in Athens.
The question of a genuine European border guard has not been formally raised, but Europe is getting close to it.
The new emergency situation in the 28th postponed the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which had been raised earlier this year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained in the text approved by a majority of 28 on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm pledge includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead in an avalanche in the Alps, three of them reportedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed in an avalanche in the French Alps.
Of German nationality, the only survivor of the eight-person group, according to authorities.
Earlier media reports said it was Polk.
A woman in her 30s was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury to her femur.
The dead were mostly in their 40s, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over and the bodies of the victims have been taken to Briancon for identification", said Hautes-Alpes departmental prefect Pierre Besnard.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the top of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, at 4,015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high", said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
He said that a huge amount of snow had been poured on the eight-man group at an altitude of about 12,000 feet [3,900 m].
The weather service did not issue a severe weather advisory for the area today.
Trpišovsky before the match against Braga:
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his first appearance in the cups, managed to get the Liberec players through the preliminary rounds of the Europa League into the main group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan will welcome the 2011 finalist Braga to the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, he wants to impose his style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout rounds, when every goal and every situation could have knocked you out on your way to the dream group, here we are, and we're playing six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we score, we can play our own tactics and we're not tied to just a two-game series.
"I am very much looking forward to it and it is a real Europe, before it was only qualifying", said Trpišovský at a press conference.
He thinks Braga's the best team.
He's going to be very active, they've got all the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good with the ball.
The opponent is probably going to be harder, because he doesn't have a name, but he has a player in his squad who I think scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's an excellent group at the top level", Trpišovský said.
But he doesn't consider Braga the clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we showed in the home competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that", said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen of eleven duels this season.
He believes Liberec can impose his style on Braz.
We're looking at a team that's going to be strong on the ball, but also unusually disciplined.
They play from a 4-4-2 formation with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players perform on the pitch", said Trpišovský.
We studied the opponent a lot in the preliminaries, which helped us a lot, but this time we want to focus on our game, so we adapted the training.
"And we definitely want, even if it's going to be very challenging, to play our notes", the coach added.
Student films are taking over the Sands, the international festival is starting.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries submitted their works to the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Pisa this year.
Forty of the films, which were sent to the final by a committee of students and teachers, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year the festival has a special theme, which is based on the festival song.
This year, it's a detective.
This year's gala's director, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theater.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our year-long trail", Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting student productions - feature films, animated films and documentaries.
The awards will be judged by an international jury, including last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The festival organizers prepare an accompanying program as they do every year.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondrej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondrej Smeykal, turboson band Poletíme?, the band Zrní or for example Petra Hapková with a recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photography exhibitions.
The first is from the graduate of the Sand Film School and the recipient of prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Asenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring you closer to the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will be present, Gerhard Gruber will accompany the silent film The Cameraman with his music, and the citizens of Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný will baptize their new book.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, to exchange experiences and to develop common bonds and the film industry", the spokesman said.
The Pitching Forum will certainly help, where students can meet film professionals, take several job interviews at once and get a job.
The festival is connected with the establishment of the Private Higher Professional Film School in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladan and Miloň Tarčovi, organized the first annual in 1997.
It was held every two years until sixth grade.
In the event of CK's bankruptcy, the insurance companies are to pay the clients' claims in full.
Insurance companies should cover the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of a travel agency in full.
The House of Representatives decided on Wednesday to approve the amended law on the conditions of business in tourism.
Travel agents will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to a bill that is being considered by the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree to the obligation to pay claims above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on the adjustment, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end their bankruptcy insurance on travel agents if the amendment is passed.
But the proposal has also been criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they'll have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Local Development Karla Šlechtová (ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Euro-compliant.
She pointed to a ruling this year by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
The insurance companies will receive enough information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, stressed Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be realistic", said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
He says the bank guarantee won't work because no one's gonna give it indefinitely.
"The travel agencies will have to close down or move abroad", warned Kalousek.
Member of the Board of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalouska's concerns based on a survey among CK members.
"Stop showing us the insurance lobby", he said.
Okamura does not consider the statements of the insurance companies to be relevant, and there is no official written statement of them to that effect.
But they're trying to figure out if the travel agents will be able to make a contribution, which Okamura says is not a problem.
The Commission has also been consulted on the draft law on the protection of personal data.
Fischer says travel agents won't be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works", said Fischer.
Her motion to remove the disputed passage was rejected by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not propose to return the bill to the committee because of the alleged contradiction with the civil code.
Philip warned of travel agencies that he said could put consumers at risk.
The rapporteur, Martina Berdych (ANO), withdrew her proposal to limit the liability of insurers in cases where they could not have known that the insurance would not cover the entire risk, in the light of the ruling of the Constitutional Court.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of four million for travel agencies offering air travel and a limit of one million for agencies selling bus trips, for example.
The limit will remain at 30% of the planned turnover from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of the insurance coverage will have to be such as to cover all the claims of the customers in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency.
The standard, even after the amendments, stipulates that travel agents will have to indicate again which travel agency organises the tours for the tours sold.
Travel agents will have to provide insurance companies with, inter alia, management and number of trips data before the contract is concluded.
The approved amendment also provides for further regular information to be provided to insurance undertakings.
Travel agents will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for tours and coupons.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that a travel agency has failed to fulfil any of its legal obligations towards an insurance company, it may, in accordance with the model, require the insurance company to make a correction or prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
The amendment also aims to reorganise the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be submitted by the end of April of the following year.
The request shall contain a report on the use of State funds in the previous year, a financial expenditure plan and a forecast for the next two years.
According to the association, the author of the law did not consider the situation that would arise if the insurance company terminated the CK contract.
She's not allowed to organize tours, and clients who bought tours before the insurance was canceled, the association says, will lose them.
In such a case, the CK would suffer a significant loss and could even go bankrupt, even if its business was in good condition.
One way in which travel agents can cope with this situation is to sue the State for damages.
Another option is to go abroad and use the much softer conditions abroad and then we will only operate as agencies in our market, said the vice-president of the association Jan Papež.
The amendment proposal also includes a bank guarantee institution, but it is so unwise that it cannot be implemented in practice, since a bank guarantee cannot be for an unlimited amount.
The association also claims that the change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the whole law will have to be revised again in the light of the new EU directive.
The Czech Republic has a total of 942 active insured travel agents.
Only three CKs have closed this year.
Domestic travel agencies sell annual tours worth about CZK 20 billion.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the flow of refugees to Europe.
The announcement was made by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with the German prime ministers.
It also reiterated its call for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 Member States.
We need to do more to help the countries where the refugees are coming from, or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I am waiting for a signal from the European Union that we will work for decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German chancellor, who said that such a signal could be increased financial aid or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The Federal States also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the burden of the refugee crisis on European countries", Merkel said.
The Brandenburg Premier Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expected genuine solidarity from all EU countries.
The Czech Republic, among others, has long opposed the allocation of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favour of speeding up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance of staying here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start integrating foreigners faster, said the Brannborough premier.
He also said that most of the money Germany spends on refugee care should be used to integrate those who have a chance of gaining asylum.
We'll need more teachers to help the refugees master German.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if refugees can be integrated, they can be a boon to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film.
Matt Damon confronted Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, arguing that it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO's Greenlight, an actor on the show interrupted Brown when she stressed the need for alternative views regarding the black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it with the cast of the movie, not the cast of the show", Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted indignantly with disbelief and sighed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments about the Martian went on the air.
Damon and Brown have teamed up with fellow celebrity producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat Harmony's character", Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character who's a whore being picked on by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People lobbied finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon dismissed their directing as "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the debate aired, social media exploded in dissent over Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed outrage at the video, "Matt Damon jumped in the conversation of the only black woman in the room so he can explain to her that diversity is so white it hurts".
The tweet has garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national momentum, pressuring lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made allusions to the movement while announcing the Album of the Year nominees during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba's still important", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent statement from the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement was in response to a question from Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a charity", the leaders declared.
Damon was recently named to a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior has its first winner.
Professional mountaineer and picker Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home $1 million.
In the race, which has just completed its seventh season, none of the competitors have managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this season's finale, two men fought their way through to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The final hurdle was a 30-second climb over a 220-meter-long rope.
Britten was the first to complete the climb within the set limit, becoming the first contestant to overcome the grueling 4 sections in American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero beat him by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero was interviewed by E! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was revealed that he was still in shock at winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life", Isaac E! said in response to his win.
So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's like now.
Executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the run up to the final and why Britten won't get any prize despite being the first contestant to complete the track.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest finisher.
"If there are multiple competitors on the track, the one with the best time wins", Weed said.
Even if winning the grand prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
I don't think he's holding a grudge.
He's glad he's been able to accomplish what he's been able to do.
He got a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
To his wife and children, he's a hero.
Geoff said to me, "If there was anyone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac".
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed the Minnesota Twins by a narrow margin.
For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of baseball's top teams, are currently in last place in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers narrowly deflected their loss when they defeated Minnesota 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and capture their second wild card in the American League.
Even if it was just for one night, for Detroit it was a return to the Z word that was so elusive to them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun, no matter how", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive lead as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took another innings in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) allowed 6 1/3 innings and three runs.
It was only his third game of his last nine.
"I want to finish this year with convincing results", Simon said.
It's hard to get into a game when you're sitting on the bench a lot, so I want to get in the game.
Tiger batter Victor Martinez hit three home runs, drove in two runs and had his first retired run since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-point game since last June, when he hit four home runs against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned in pretty good", Ausmus said.
He looked good in practice, he shot significantly better, and he was able to take that into the game.
With three runs in the bottom of the seventh, the Twins have the best chance of getting back in the game.
Center Byron Buxton won the game with two points on the left side of the field.
Right-hander Aaron Hicks scored on a set-up and Simon struck out Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and had Miguel San in front of him, who shot a two-run homer and left right-hander Drew Verhagen behind.
With two players on goal and a chance to tie in the second, VerHagen managed to send a third-yard run through two goals.
Plouffe has 27 two-goal shutouts this season and is king of the league.
Detroit held on for the ninth, Mauer scored two runs and Bruce Rondon made it 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander knocked San out on three pitches.
Detroit took advantage and scored on Phil Hughes' play.
The Tigers have won three in their first two innings against a retired right-hander who entered the game after a month-long hiatus from the game due to back muscularity.
"I definitely didn't imagine this was the start", said Hughes, "but by the third shift I felt I was throwing better".
After resisting a first-half thrust, Hughes gave up a one-point lead to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Two outs for right-hander J.D. Martinez, and Victor Martinez, who went all the way first.
Victor Martinez has broken his streak to 0-21.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a right-handed field goal and scored another run, but Victor Martinez was passed over as he tried to make it to third.
The Tigers added to their second-half lead when pitcher James McCann and pole vaulter Anthony Gose scored two and one-point shots to make the score 3-0 on the scoreboard.
"It got us down on our knees", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place.
Hughes, who won the toss, finished third inning with no points and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes has three home runs, six RBIs and four strikeouts.
ANIBAL SANCHES, right-handed pitcher for the Tigers, ended the game with pain in his right shoulder.
He's being treated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the injured list with a sprained shoulder since mid-August, is expected to start Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-hander Daniel Norris, who returns from injury to face the Twins.
Since Norris was traded to left-handed pitcher David Price on June 30, he's 1-1 in four games.
But he hasn't played since August 20th because of a sprained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is facing Minnesota left-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies", he said of the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
The promotion of opening-up in the emerging reforms will provide new impetus and vitality, and also provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list regulatory market access, relaxation of border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be progressively tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from interested parties on the measures in question.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and ensure that companies themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and provide them with better services", the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a 'green card', thanks to the optimisation of requirements and simplification of the application process.
The meeting also discussed the safeguarding of lawyers' rights to practice and develop the professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and senior officials Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, a new hospital may be created.
According to the deputy chief of the Karlovy Vary region, Jakub Paniek (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the wards of the individual hospitals.
But there are also opportunities to expand care in the county.
For example, a surgical unit could have a day surgery centre, where surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed according to a set concept.
It is not yet clear which specific hospitals should have day surgery facilities.
The skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital could also be a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an Apalachicola center to care for patients with cerebral palsy who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anaesthesia and resuscitation unit.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Island Hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in Karlovy Vary Region is the post-treatment bed, in particular the bed of the Long-Term Nursing Centre (LDN), which is inadequate in Nejdek and should be closely linked to the acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
He points out that the main hospital in which the following care beds are missing is Karlovy Vary.
There's a place where you could use the abandoned buildings after the centralization.
Last but not least, there are no social health beds in Karlovy Vary Region for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
There's a shortage of these beds throughout the republic, so it could be used for other counties as an Alzheimer's center.
The recommendation also states that hospitals should prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, which will be financed by European grants.
'These are beds that will be built on top of the specialist care areas and will provide a space for transferring patients after surgery, for example after cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other procedures,' the regional concept of bed-care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
