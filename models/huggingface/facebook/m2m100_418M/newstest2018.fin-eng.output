Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, diagnosed with a mental illness and now she makes art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
On the roof of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Images, dozens of patient reports are covered.
Each of them contains the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written up their interpretation of the Auer and its identity.
He decided who he was for him.
"I wanted to tell my personal treatment history so that the violence of the process became visible," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the process of sexual correction.
It is often a year-long research period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process begins by sending the "gender identity disorder" diagnosis tests, which are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process began four years ago.
Already before that, he had used the estrogen he ordered via the internet and was still very long in his own repair process.
She found herself a woman, but according to the Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaw, or Law on the Establishment of Transgender Gender (563/2002) obliges transgender people to be forced to sterilize in order for the right gender to be reached, for example, in the Population Registry Centre and in the Passport.
Currently, every genetic corrector requires a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of reproductive insufficiency.
Man has the right to decide on his own body.
“This situation is unbearable and violates human rights,” Auer says.
The reform of the Trans-Law has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight comments on the law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The former government of Finland prepared a law amendment under the leadership of then social and health minister Susanne Huovisen.
The elections came and the Finns came up to the government.
The legislative change is back on.
It is a matter of internal policy disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to raise it to the table because there are disputes within the government regarding the amendment of the law,” said Frank Johansson, operating director of the Amnesty’s Finnish department.
The exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the drugs used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist of the transpol of the University Hospital of Tampere on the Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice, and on the basis of these, he wrote a story that should define Auer's right to care and help.
The reality that is studied appears to be exposed to humiliation.
The self-consciousness of the studied person appears to be fragmented in a border-level way, and the instability characteristics associated with personality are highlighted.
He did not recognize himself from these images.
“It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with a mental illness,” Auer says.
Even greater shock was when Auer was not granted sexual remedial treatment.
The medical staff said his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was banned from his identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and threw the transpol waiting hall to the TV.
Later from that television came a work called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person born as a woman can enlarge his chest, but to remove the chest needs a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel different from the amount of your sex defined at birth.
Our experience is not the only of its quality.
For many, the sex recovery process is harder for mental reasons than purely because of medical operations.
Those who pass through it meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are refused to be treated, calling for their resources to be not enough,” Auer says.
Many persons who are seeking the process have a psychological symptom behind: depression, anxiety, possible temptation experiences.
With reference to these, the medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
“The prevention of treatment and assistance can bring a person to an even worse situation than it was before the process began,” Auer says.
Auer’s individual exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: “I’ve had self-destruction thoughts throughout my adulthood and that’s something people’s generally difficult to melt.”
Depression was treated with medications and when Auer started using hormones, the feeling was relieved.
He had finally been able to express the feelings that had existed in childhood and adolescence.
Why the wide leak didn’t feel suitable for its own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat breast.
The most important thing for Auer was that there were people close to him who saw him.
Seeing is a basic requirement.
“It is also necessary to justify so much by talking, dressing, using voice and moving,” he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing his coming to be seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the random comments of close persons could hurt a lot.
The most painful thing is when the victims are killed.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they do not agree or are able to internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all transhyms need physical changes.
They do not suffer from kehodysphoria, i.e. a body conflict in which the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and the long process of research, however, you cannot get an official confirmation of your own sex.
“There is no medical basis for these studies,” Auer says.
And that is true.
For example, in Denmark, in June 2014, the Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination in relation to legal gender.
The elderly applicant shall submit a written application for a new identity, indicating in it that he feels he is of the other sex.
After a six-year consideration period, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the ministry gives the applicant a new identity.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland and the Auer's exhibition is also critical for this requirement.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of theaters.
I want to believe that art still has a weight and that it can lead to political changes, during which politicians have forgotten human rights.

Civil rights organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The national organization for the rights of African-American citizens, NAACP, has issued a travel warning against Missouri. The cause is the state's discriminatory practices and racist attacks that occurred there.
“The NAACP’s Missouri Travel Report will come into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and be extremely cautious when traveling to a state where a number of controversial racial events have recently occurred,” the organization said in a statement.
The law, which has recently entered into force in Missouri, complicates the export of discrimination cases to court. In addition, the state law enforcement is disproportionately targeted to minorities. according to the NAACP, these facts led to the issue of a travel warning.
“People’s rights are violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and abused or killed,” NAACP’s Missouri chairman Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
“We have never heard of so many cases in the same short time.”
The Missouri travel document is the organization’s first U.S. state warning.
The organization mentioned as examples the racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in doubtful circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car dropped fuel. Missouri police arrested him even though he was not accused of a crime.
The travel report also referred to the Missouri Justice Minister’s investigation that the police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
“The purpose of the travel report is to encourage people to be cautious and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri,” Chapel says.
“People must prepare, for example, by taking money to pay the guarantees or by telling their relatives that they intend to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, in 2015 there were a hundred hostilities in Missouri, the sixteen most recorded states in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult for to challenge the right for discrimination in residence and employment relations.
The organization for the rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution, ACLU, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that force the police to arrest people for immigration offences.
Generally, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they apply to other states. Recently, however, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Lintilä asks Finnair to report on the executive director's additional retirement
The business minister Mika Lintilä (central) responsible for the state’s ownership management has asked Finnair for a report on the additional pension fee received by the airline’s executive director Pekka Vauramon, Yle says.
This is contrary to the state’s declaration of will.
The additional pension of €130,000 received by Vauramo rose this week when Helsingin Sanomat about the remuneration of the directors of stock companies.
The Finnish Kuvaleht announced the additional pension of Vauramo in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up additional pensions in 2013.
The government has stated that additional pensions should not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the principle decision on ownership management last year.
The sanctions immediately strengthened the speech.
Even a while ago it seemed that the relations between the United States and Russia are on the way from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting held in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met showed their future actions greatly.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday reacted sharply in Russia.
The tightening response has so far been heard by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, saying Trump’s signed sanction law means “a full-fledged trade war.”
Although the Russian reactions would only be quoted as a political rhetoric, the climbing between the United States and Russia is a fact shortly after Trump’s election.
In the United States, the passing of the forced laws on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
The Congress approved the law with a considerable consensus, but it was much more difficult for the President to approve the law.
Trump also criticized the law he recently signed as "significantly insufficient."
The President Trump’s shame might have been caused in particular by Russia, although the adoption of a law that restricts his own powers has also had to be contradictory.
As well known, the U.S. is investigating Russia’s potential interference with the presidential election and the Trump campaign’s relations with Russia.
The collapse between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short quarry month.
As the White House staff has changed strictly and various scandalous turns have been revealed almost up to date, it seems more and more clear that the U.S. foreign policy is not under the leadership of the president but despite the president.
This situation is in no way desirable.
If the relationship between Russia and the United States is imminent, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tensional security situation in the EU’s nuclear area in the Baltic Sea is boosting the relations.
The EU has seen the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Treaty.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy with Russia at least on the main side, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country like Finland, which is doing a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real rise.
The effects of the U.S. forced law are still unclear.
The EU is concerned that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects can be seen, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
The acidity in Europe has been caused by the fact that sanctions have been excluded, for example, the liquid natural gas lng important to the U.S. economy.
Trade sanctions are a way in world politics to show anger.
However, economic sanctions must be well considered and careful.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than benefitful.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Trump's White House is now on the goal of the Freedom Path
The absence of paths is a certain sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as the others: the Iraqi soldiers, together with the American soldiers, collapse Saddam Hussein on the square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists of the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a harsh debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Freedom Pace was attacked by Miller in a speech on the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done that, he would have gotten up with the enormous waves of crossroads organizers and the characters imitating the Freedom Path.
The object of his attack was the significance of the patsa and in particular the fact that in 1903 a poem of Emma Lazarus was added to the patsa – 17 years after completing the patsa.
As Miller said, “I don’t want to go further into history now, but the Freedom Path is... the symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later, and it does not belong to the original Freedom Pass.”
Miller himself wasn’t wrong, but it’s not just about history, as he himself said.
“Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”
The poetry is more contemporary than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism. he made it clear that “the poorest” are not welcome to Trump’s United States.
The controversy on the significance of the Freedom Path is part of a wider political and cultural controversy on the significance of the United States.
Lazarus' friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to his foot. They knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the Pattaya was to manifest the connections between the French and American republics in the classical comparison, the female corporalization of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but it has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the expelled.
The attachment of the poem to the picture was a genius feminist assassination and a devastating attack on American nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the path, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to the original.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh, a guide who can now be considered a kind of forecast for Trump, claimed that the Freedom Pace is not an invitation to anyone, but is the early pioneer of the new conservatives that leads the U.S. to a dark-covered world: “Lady Liberty comes out.
He takes freedom to move from the United States to the world.
The heat doesn’t show the way to the United States.”
Rarely yes, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of freedom depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the boat after a long and trivial journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Spirit of Freedom consolates by giving hope and hoping to be welcomed.
That’s what Miller and Trump don’t want.
Their wrath does not show the way, but throw the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots entered the UK national team.
Neil Black, the result director of the UK Sports Federation, said the 16 Scottish members of the world championship team are “a significant confirmation.”
A record number of Scottish athletes will be selected for the World Cup in London on Friday.
Black said in Scotland “there’s something special happening,” from which the UK’s general sport must learn.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to investigate it so long that we understand what the question is,” Black says.
“I talked with the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the Institute’s work.
The Scottish General Sports Federation, again, believes that it is related to the Union’s activities,
The British Sports Federation believes that it is the background of their activities.
And the ordinary streetman thinks he has to have something to do with it.
But it’s a great thing, and that’s why.”
Many Scottish athletes are seriously competing in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who compete with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-meter race.
“Eilidh is unnecessarily modest.
His captain’s speech was incredibly wonderful,” Black says.
“The outsiders left the opportunity with pride in their achievements and strong motivation, regardless of where they are going to live and practice.
The words of Eilidh had a genuine sense and passion for sport.”
Eilidh Doyle is the Silver Medalist of the People's Community Championships at the 400 meters wide range, and this is his fifth World Championship. He considers it "unbelievable" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 and 2015.
During the year, Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records.
He competes in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O’Hare runs 1,500 meters in London. He’s also worth watching: he’s behind a great season, including wins at the UK World Cup and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when the country's only Scott to add him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the country team says he is “very proud” that there are so many Scots, some of whom are seriously competing for final places and medals.
“To be a captain is a great honor, but even more special is because the members of the national team vote for the captain,” Doyle says.
“I’m very proud of all the scots that came into the national team.
It shows how far we have gone.
They are involved as winning athletes who compete for prize winners.
The Captain’s Speech?
I think it went well.
I’m focusing on how lucky we are when we’re home.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are again at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be unpleasant.”
Blocking Auditors on Facebook: Don’t Submit to a Public Job If You Don’t Resist to Criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him from all possible domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism is irritated.
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led to stupidity and silence like sheep to be killed,” Washington said in 1783.
From there we get to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their representatives.
The U.S. Civil Rights Federation has challenged Hogan's court earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was humiliated also online.
“It’s just Facebook,” many commented.
But it is important,
Especially in Hogan’s case.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the Democratic state.
He has been ranked second among the 50 best governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to the heat.
He has led the state firmly and strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and posted a picture of his chemotherapy-trained capture.
Therefore, blocking users coming to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum, which isined by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was just about moderating the comments.
However, drawing comments as trolls, spammers or haters is a too easy solution.
The Washington Post interviewed Hogan’s Facebook blocked users.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk with their chosen leaders. They were not trolls but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They said their comments were respectful, attentive and accurate.
The pastor borrowed the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not hostile, but asked about hatred crimes.
“I am pleasantly disappointed with the fact that Hogan has not taken a position on hatred crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in a commentary to the Washington Post.
“I can also not accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately regarded as a organized crowd and neglected as a large group of concerned citizens.”
The Governor’s staff called the comments “centralized as an attack.” Someone could call them important to promote the matters considered.
In the era of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
Before the old, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical main writings, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But it is the same thing, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of blaming Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him in court.
The first major decision on this issue was made last week in Virginia.
The Alexandria Court Judge James C. Cacheres said the Loudoun County government violated the first U.S. Constitution amendment while blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Alliance went to discuss with the Republican Governor of Kentucky Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, cheap mail payments had the same effect as today’s internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers stumbled Washington.
There were trolls at that time.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote in the newspaper letters in which they caught Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, i.e. the Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom. This is shown from the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of speech and freedom of speech are the foundation of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer food should be stopped immediately.
The samples have come from about half a place, and in addition to online ads from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Ordinary Finland, but then also individual from Haapaveda and Seinäjo, says specialist Marja Isomursu Evirasta.
They have died of a trikomonous illness.
It is caused by a particular animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit the thumbs, and of them especially the pudding.
In the 21st century, however, the disease began to be detected by mirrors.
In 2009 it went well.
At that time, the trikomonous caused a major collapse in the Finnish greenhouse, after which the species' positions have been to recover.
There have been, but not at least yet in a large scale, the museum master Juha Honkala at the University of Helsinki's Natural Sciences Centre Museum (Creation) says.
It is terrible that the previous epidemic of green spiders is repeating again, unless something is done.
What you have to do now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop bird summer diet immediately.
More on the topic later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of home-field representation at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of the home-field performance for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in Eastern Latvia hosts the 25th Scotland Senior Open tournament.
The Northern Irish Rafferty last year led the tournament held in the neighboring Archerfield Links field before the last round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is pleased with a new place and serves as the tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it reaches its full glory,” Rafferty says.
“The players see the field in the best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry has done great work with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
This tournament is a great event for this field.”
England Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour for 32 years.
“This seems really a special opportunity,” the Southport player says.
“I couldn’t defend my victory at Extremadura Open because the tournament was not part of this year’s tour.
It is great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories return to my mind: the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to real action on his own ground. He joined the tour after completed earlier this year for 50 years.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
“At home, playing is always more relevant than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel an extra pressure.
I playing again and played a lot.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The three will follow the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament includes six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

At the end of the day, we explored possible internal air problems.
There are no internal air problems found at least for the moment in the box office of the Porin prikaat news company, the prikaat was Thursday.
Internal air research is ongoing.
The investigation began when the man who stopped his equipment for health reasons thought his health was deteriorated due to the poor interior air in the shell.
Porin Prikaat’s Chief Executive Officer, Everst Lieutenant Mika Holman said there were no problems in the health situation of other equipment men.
It turned out that it was an individual case and that no other employees in that unit had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
It is currently unknown that we will have any internal air problems, Holma says.
In a statement from Prikat, it is said that due to the arrival in July, goods had to be transferred to the shops, which is why the dust could have increased instantly.
The air could have seemed thin, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Country of Indonesia
Bardina Degei does not use hella in cooking.
She does not use cats very rarely.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotalis, the capital of the Panai region, located in the indigenous province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the bathat – locally “not” – directly on his vineyard.
After half an hour, the burned batat is eaten with naked, unwashed hands.
Dege's house has no furniture. He sits on a stunning painting floor, where he usually also takes care of his daily steps, such as a washing machine from the nearest mouth in a stunning water.
The office of the hall is delivered by a stone in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of his husband’s four wives, and he has not been prescribed to be treated.
Diversity is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most people in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare turmoil in the papua mountains, the former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch authority, quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which keeps the region strictly under its control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The journey to it begins in a half-hour flight from the province's capital Jayapur to Nabire and continues with a stumbling five-hour drive in the hill of a rental car.
There is no public transportation here.
About 19,000 inhabitants in the city have wooden houses surrounded by bamboo, whose wave plates have been painted by roses in clock roses.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Himalayan Papuan Mee Pago worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have occurred.
“We didn’t have such clothes,” says Degei. He means a colourful, hand-woven clothes, a dark shirt, and a bright-colour bag.
“Before we had only leaves covered by our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia. 28 percent of its inhabitants live below the poverty limit, and child mortality and countlessness are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold country of Indonesia.
Paniai is an approximately New Jersey-sized upper area with 153,000 inhabitants. Just about a hundred kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mining. It is owned by the Freeport McMoran company with headquarters in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mining produced $3.1 billion in gold and copper for Freeport.
Moreover, Papu has an estimated $78 billion in trees.
For the Pope, however, these wealths bring misery, as they mean the suppressing presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid $20 million to local military personnel and local military units between 1998 and 2004.
Papua’s demands of greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are silent without mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 papua and rape, torture and imprisonment thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass murders at the heights of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s were genocide proportions.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region during peaceful demonstrations.
The 2016 We Will Lose Everything report of Brisbane’s archipelago has reports of the crimes of the past year, such as execution without trial, torture – rape and electrical attacks are popular means – and untouchable attacks toward peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to calculate the number of victims because there are cases every week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The roofs are striking as the Papuan natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the populated Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move Muslims to the region in the hope of better survival.
Japanese warung food stores sell baked chicken and gado-gado vegetable mixture in a potato.
Local people are hard to compete.
“Migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the tower cheaper than the local,” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Panama and moved to the province’s capital for work.
“The local women lost their customers.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – his surname Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to interfere with Papua’s injustice and human rights violations.
Papua is composed of 29 districts, and this former woodhouse won the vote in 27 districts, including Pania, on his journey to the Presidential Square of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed on the Pope, and the locals feel they’ve been deceived.
“Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to meet our wishes and restore justice,” You says.
The panels experienced some kind of wave base only two months after Jokow's October officials.
Eighteen children were singing Christmas songs on the edge of Enarotalis on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on a motorcycle.
The scared children told the soldiers that they should wear driving lenses.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Teba, the man returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers captured the children and abused them by hunting them.
One of the soldiers shot the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, died in a coma as a result of abuse.
A couple of hours later, the building of the state election committee located near the place of the event was burned into fire, and the next day it began to happen.
Around a thousand papua – young men and women and children – gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried with them hunting lines for celebrations, and they began to show the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago house, where they danced in the ring and traced bird singing.
Some of the protesters began to stone the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere was hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: “If human troops do resistance more than three times, shoot them dead.”
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident leader of the Kego Koto area, imagined that the situation would escape from the hands and asked the crowd to relax and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
“When I turned around, I was shot on my left edge,” she told TIME with a bright-colored wooden paint.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the creator came from the arms of the soldiers.
“There were a number of shootings.”
Alfius Youwia was shot three times. his grandmother saw the shootings.
“I went to her and checked that it was really him,” John told TIME in trouble. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
Papua police inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police only “protected” the police station because it was the target of the attack.
“We have to defend when people are threatening to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The death was in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi held an emotional speech in Jayapur, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to intervene in the violence of Papua.
“I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it will never happen again.”
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations on human rights violations outside the judicial system.
He immediately canceled his speech.
“Most of the crimes occurred a long time ago.
in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes,” he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he did not intend to start investigations on Papu.
“Everything will be resolved in court,” he said.
The crimes are linked to the deaths of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence referendum in East Timor in 1999.Viranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Panama.
The families of the victims of Panama are treating the allegations blindly unbelievably.
“I have been interviewed four times over the past three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” says Johannes.
“I’m tired of this.”
She says she will continue to live in fear, even though it has been happening for years.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid that the army will arrest me, I’m afraid that I’m shot.”
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panicists don’t dare to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped burial four of the victims.
“The soldiers are looking for me in their hands after the victims’ burial,” he says.
The shootings have not ended.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot dead in the neighboring area of Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the building company's manager, which began when the manager refused to take the man who lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man in need of hospitalization was the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been stuck with water while fishing on a nearby river.
Angry villagers showed their minds in the building workplace in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stone the police, who responded with warning shots.
According to local officials, an Indonesian police unit opened fire to a crowd, killing one citizen.
“We are scared, we are scared of rejection,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw when the wounded were brought to treatment.
“I’ve been in the house for two days.”
Deiya's parliament has called for the shootings of the shooters and the responsibility of the police and the withdrawal of a moving police unit from the area.
Panama has always been a problem point for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal villages that live with the Papua wheem in the middle streets.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebellion army, claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by random attacks and kidnapping Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and capturing thousands of people in Panama in the name of the “protection of national sovereignty”.
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the popes, Paniai is known as “a sad, forgotten place.”
Poverty causes dissatisfaction.
In Enarotals there is only a little rice to be sold, and it’s too expensive for local people, too.
Like the bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly batates and some fruit and leafs.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman’s responsibility can be four or five bathtubs.
The majority is for the family, and the rest is sold on the tower.
Ten batates cost only 10,000 rubles (75 cents).
Over time, the differences between local and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes have been opened to Nabira Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to local more educated and rich migrants.
Only a few people have sufficient capital and skills to run their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” says Pani’s family council chairman John Gobai.
The distant Papua remains a little of attention in the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international news are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they were granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
Phelim Kinen, the assistant leader of Human Rights Watch in Asia, said Jokowi has not fulfilled his election promises. he has not increased transparency and has not contributed to the development by removing news restrictions.
“Reporters reporting about Papua and West Papua in Indonesia’s unrestful eastern provinces have new risks: refusing visa and falling on the blacklist,” Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure only by the neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “the numerous and widespread violations of Papua”, including the gunfire in Panama.
These states have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations and told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of speech, so it would be difficult to cover evidence of human rights violations.”
The local government wants the government to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapur on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, an anonymous resident source who participated in the meeting said.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
“Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are interfering with the Panic shooting,” said the Chairman of the Chairman, Gobai.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the panicists: they live under the power of an acute and unpredictable army in the shortage and poverty, practically without healthcare and education opportunities.
According to Goba, the panicists, like the other papuans, consider the voice they gave to Jokow as a “duty” that must be paid back.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and fears, the relatives of the victims of the Panama shooting showed opposition in a similar way: they buried one of the victims in the opposite land of the police station and the military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let the responsible forget their crimes.
“My family member was killed,” Yacobus says the head in pressures.
“What else could we do?”
Dereck Chisora shakes Robert Helenius' re-match cancellation: "Edes their own fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran were scheduled to take up on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora raises the reason for floping the new match completely to the hearts of Helenius.
My match in Finland flopped, but it was not my reason.
I don’t live in Finland, I don’t want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even her fans don’t want to see her fighting because she’s sad, Chisora shakes.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The new match’s ticket sales went rapidly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match was transferred to the autumn.
There was nothing new in the game.
However, the withdrawal is no longer harmful to Chisora.
The match would probably have been cancelled after Chisora was sick.
On Thursday, three days before the match time, I woke up with severe pain.
My thyroid was explosive.
In the hospital, I was told I had to cut off, Chisora says.
The UK says it is about 45 percent.
He is not interested in a new match with Helenius, but is aimed at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whytelle in December.
The fire overturned the Torch cloud cutting machine in Dubai
The strikes took over the world's highest housing building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of inhabitants were forced to escape from the 337 meters high 79-storey building.
This was already the second fire within two years in the building, whose name happens to be Torch, scattered.
The building was empty and no one was known to be injured.The cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
“We were sleeping and we woke up with the fire alarm and the people’s screams.
We ran the stairs down from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,” George’s resident told Reuters.
Dubai rescue authorities said the fire was shut down at 4 a.m. local time and left to cool the building.
The government has announced that it will arrange accommodation for those left their homes.
The incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer roofs of high buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Board of Directors of the Torch Building conducted an investigation that found that the most damages were the discs used to cover and isolate the public sheet.
In the UK, police believe that London’s Grenfell Tower’s isolation and coating plates could contribute to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.

More than 20 percent of air passengers carry forbidden objects in the U.S. aircraft, a survey reveals
A survey on passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the U.S. had consciously or unconsciously exported forbidden objects to aircraft through the U.S. Traffic Safety Agency (TSA) inspection points. At least six percent of passengers had knife or other items equipped with steel that they didn’t know were forbidden.
Less than one percent said they were only later aware that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to threaten the rules to others.
Of those who consciously violated the TSA rules, 19.7 percent were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15 percent belonged to the X generation.
Most often, the rules were violated by bringing food and fluids to the aircraft.
Furthermore, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they imported forbidden drugs to the aircraft consciously.
The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally exported counterfeit goods through the security inspection and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most travellers are also taking fraudulent goods most likely to pass the security check – consciously or unknownly.
But as the survey company says, TSA’s instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often don’t know what liquid to be taken into the aircraft and how much.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of the TSA captures are fluids.
For some time, there was also the idea that books should not be brought into the aircraft.
The aircraft may be transported for domestic flights but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ruled his decision to delay Obama's decision to reduce emissions.
A day after 15 states had appealed against Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the decrees made during Obama's administration to reduce emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads takes the previous governments better into account the needs of state environmental decision makers.
Pruitt did not mention in a word any appeal against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeal.
States should begin to comply with the 2015 standard for surface ozon from 1.10.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would move the implementation of the decisions from year to year, so that his agency will have more time to get acquainted with the plan because the agency “will not interfere with local decision making or hinder economic growth.”
Pruitt was the general prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the leader of the EPA.
After arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly attempted to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the industries that use fossil fuels.
The sudden change on Wednesday is the last backdrop on Pruitt’s plan to relieve the rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA’s chief exceeded his powers in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s decision concerning oil and gas companies.
In a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, Pruitt claimed that his full-fledged adoption of ozon regulations only reinforces EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the schedule.
“In the past governments, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge the right to reach agreement on schedules,” Pruitt said.
“We don’t believe in the regulation that takes place through the trial and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take the regulation on our activities seriously and its Finnish powers to us.”
However, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use “their powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers” to ensure that the provisions “be justified and based on the best available information.”
The Republicans are driving a wider change in the ozon regulations in Congress.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The New York State Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, head of the EPA’s state union, said the group intends to continue the pressure.
“The EPA’s change of mind as a result of our lawsuits is a significant win for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of the flood in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ozone is produced when, for example, the emissions of cars, power plants, oil processing plants and chemical plants react to the sunlight in the atmosphere.
This resulting vomiting can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitive groups of people. It is also a part of the cause of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmental promoters were pleased with the surprising directional change in Pruitt.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy responsible for our breathing atmosphere use a healthy sense,” says Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biodiversity.
“We must, however, fight against the Trump administration, because its ideological goal is to act under the conditions of the pollutants and other groups in their own interest.”
The supercar manufacturer becomes a street car - "disappears in the style of Ferrari"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars while striving to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it’s going to happen in the Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at a news conference on Wednesday.
The new strategy details will be revealed next year as the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All Eastern Sawyer spider cases of the same type of virus
The bacterial bacterial infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of Eastern Sawyer, THL reports.
The Virology Laboratory of the Institute of Health and Welfare on Thursday confirmed that the fifth asthma infection in East Sava has the same viral range as previous infections.
THL has assured that a person with coastal disease on Friday, 28 July, has the same type of virus as the previous cases of Eastern Sava.
Based on this information, all the infections found in the East Sawa are related to the first, in the region in June detected ashes.
The news is good, because it means that we have not been revealed any other types of tuberculosis.
However, it is possible that from the remains of the fifth infected, new infections may be revealed until mid-August, and the epidemic therefore is not yet over, says Dr. Mirkaleena Erkkil, who is responsible for infectious diseases in Soster's primary health care department.
No new bacterial diseases or suspicions have been revealed after the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is important that everyone take care of their own vaccination protection, Erkilä reminds.

Finland is preparing for permission
The Pontiak cup was not even considered to be legalized.
On the background, the process produces wine alongside methane, which is toxic.
The manufacturing of a kilu at home is legal next year, but the legalization of a pontia cup is not even considered.
The clay is made by the mouth, and the pontic again by the distillation.
On the background of the regulation of the tissue, there is a reason that the process produces methane alongside the wine, which is toxic.
There has not been a political will to establish a pontia keita as a single-member right, the government council Ismo Tuominen of the Ministry of Social and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the pontia distillation was not considered to be legalized.
It was not put on the political table either.
There was no discussion on the release of Tislaam, the MP Outi Mäkelä (kok.) said.
He is in the negotiation board of the parliamentary groups of the government parties, who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
The permit of the Pontiff at home for distribution can not even be granted on the application.
Commercial manufacturing is also permitted.
Importation tells you that the simple rule comes to the home preparation of alcoholic beverages: alcohol should be made at home by visiting.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider, and wine, you can legally make a whisky at home.
The government wants to simplify the rules.
The new law will remove the requirements of the flavours and aromatics and will enable the fabrication of the shell, the shell to accurate.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavour and aromatic ingredients produced in the context of their passage are clearly observable in the drink.
According to the new law, the beverage may be prepared for yourself as much as you want, and your own alcohol can be given as a gift.
It is not allowed to be sold.
It is no longer a public health problem, he believes.
A much greater change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberated.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The prohibition of alcohol is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act comes to parliament as soon as the year begins.
The meeting is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It’s as if the parliament had already taken a position, the Meckel is pleased.
Oscar Pistorius was sent to hospital by armed guardians
Oscar Pistorius was sent to a hospital in South Africa for a heart attack.
Pistorius has been removed from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is sentenced to prison in Atteridgeville.
According to the British magazine Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital this morning by the armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from breasts, but he left the hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for trials.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was in good condition.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-fold paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Litterated telephone talks reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders' telephone talks have been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on January 27, 2017, Trump called on Mexico President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speech that he will not pay for the proposed border.
The U.S. President called the News on the fact that it had swallowed the wall project publicly. ”You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump has launched his presidential campaign promising to build a wall on the U.S. southern border at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a literation of Trump’s first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. will take refugees on the way to Australia is “smiling”, “smiling” and “smiling.” Trump said the agreement negotiated during Obama’s season would make him look “idiot” because he had proposed a ban on refugees settling in the U.S.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the day.”
Georgian massacre: activists reject the right to racist lynching
The Ford Mercury car crosses the crowd in the small town of Monroe in the rural area of Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore’s Ford Bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver. Four armed men shut down the road before the car runs on the bridge.
The leader of the crowd, a middle-aged man dressed in a rainbow dress, takes a deep breath of his cigar and turns through the windscreen.
Passengers are scared.
“Roger, n---u!” the man wrapped.
“From the car!”
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a reboot, which was presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the shakes of shock are genuine when the puppy is swallowed into the “Roger” neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to the Moore’s Ford Bridge to rearrange the events of 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan linked two black pairs, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one was accused of murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested over these years – even though the murders live among us and many have to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the re-living arrangements.
“It’s the shame of history, but above all, it’s the burden that burns our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
It also reminds the inhabitants of Monroe that the illness has never been corrected.
We want things to be finally resolved, and we want to recover from sadness and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice,” Brooks says.
“We can’t recover and make reconciliation until we get justice.”
The death investigator covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgian massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to NBC news reports, FBI documents found that more than 50 men from Monroe and its surrounding districts were suspected of lynching.
No one was accused of murder.
Although the guilty has been released for decades, the activists say the motives of the lynching have been constantly known to local people: politics and sex.
In 1946 the black people of the state of Georgia received the Supreme Court's decision to vote for the first time in presidential elections. The Supreme Court made its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, at the time of the election, there was an incident in which the black-hole rental farmer Roger Malcom shot the white land owner Barnett Hester in a struggle that apparently touched Malcom's wife Dorothya.
According to Brooks, there were rumors in the city that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for a child.
According to the FBI, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom a $600 guarantee on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
At home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their sisters Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
A crowd stopped their cars before Moore’s Ford Bridge.
“It has been revealed that Harrison ordered and arranged murders,” the FBI reports say.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. the authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks expresses this more thoroughly.
“It was a vote murder,” he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to tell the black people that they would do the same if they intended to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been guiding the massacre of Georgia for almost a decade.
It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe already lost from today’s United States.
It’s hard to see, but it’s even more difficult not to see what Greene says is intended.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we’ll have to face our own dark side,” the director says.
“But I can’t create a relationship with you if you don’t listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve had to experience.”
On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen black and a dozen white – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director of Green.
He has been presenting the local Ku Klux Clan leader in the re-release for years, but the role is always equally difficult and impeccable.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” says Marbaugh.
But it is important that this side of history be kept out, so that it will never be repeated again.”
On the other side of the room, the mountains are trained by Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, namely Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and works with Hester. He is angry about Hester having a relationship with Dorothy.
“Do you not hear?” I said, “I’m going to go away, n-u!”
Rascona or Hester responds.
Then it gets a shot.
And then all (at least all black actors) explode to laughter.
Greene laughs more hard.
“What?” asked Rascona.
He is confused.
“Is it too hard?” he asks.
“You don’t,” Greene laughed.
“I just don’t think that the white people used the word n---u at that time.”
“Yes,” another black actor confirms.
“It’s a slang. you have to use a longer version.”
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room power a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just because of the show. They want to respect the memory of the victims of their death.
The meeting begins from the beginning.
Now the words of Rashid are going back.
No one laughs.
The reconstruction ends quickly and violently.
Crying, shooting and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral seat stands next to the bodies and sings the song of Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken with each other word.
A few ten meters away, fifty spectators wiped their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of the population is black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to watch the show from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have visited, under Brooks' guidance, the graves of the victims in the pressing moisture of Georgia.
The murders have changed from the story to the truth. the mood at the place of the event is heavy.
After the song show, Greene calls the crowd to check the bodies.
The children rise to look at the acts and the unmoving bodies and cling to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” the little boy mouths like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who showed the lingerie sparked their sign and throwed tears.
Bradshaw fights Marbaugh, a man represented by the local Ku Klux Clan director.
Nick Rascona fights two actors and then breaks to tears after the show.
“There’s no trouble,” the woman involved in the show comforted.
“We know you’re not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
The audience and the actors will meet for a dinner.
The white couple, who arrived from the altan, discussed the show with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinsky is difficult to find words when she describes the feelings raised by the presentation.
“It’s hard to listen to terrible words and to see the terrible actions that people who look like you say and do – just because they look like you,” she says.
“My presentation made it clear that lynks continue to occur,” he added. ”They are just called arrestations.”
On the other side of the room, Brooks reminds the development of civil rights to the listeners sitting on the same table.
He says he has already started planning for the next year.
“Renewal is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we’ve experienced, but it’s also a teaching experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it.”
Fertilizing plants in stores is worse: This amount of removal of "excess parts" really saves
Is it permissible to remove flower leaves already in the store before putting?
How much does it take out of ananas, and how much does it weigh?
The answers share the opinions strongly: for one it is a sign of extreme dirt, while others don’t want to pay for the vegetables for those parts they don’t use and who, however, go home to the dirt.
The phenomenon is seen in the stores.
For example, in the Helsinki Ruoholahden K-Citymarket’s vegetable department, there are boxes, because many cut out, for example, the leaf parts of the flower cabbage.
From the box the leaves are exported to the commercial biofuels.
According to the news published by the Economists, smoking with vegetable risks surprises traders.
But how much does the removal of extra portions of vegetables before punning really save money?
How important is this really a bullshit?
We Women tested how the price changes when ananas, latva-artisocks, flavours, parsakaals and flower cakes take leaves or patches away.
Flower cabbage: the price of a flower cabbage that paid 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros, when all the leaves were cut off.
Ananas: The total price of ananas that paid 2.30 euros dropped to 1.95 euros when it dropped off.
Latvian art class: the price of €2.60 was €2.40 when the short-term position was cut off.
Two sensitive wines cost a total of 75 cents.
Unfortunately, the price was 60 cents.
Parsack: A medium-sized parsack cost 1 euro and without a load of 80 cents.
The result: If the leaves and positions go out of the nail, save a few dozen centimeters for one vegetable at the best time.
With a percentage consideration, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 percent.
That would have saved a total of €1.20 from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona, the brass star signed a five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian footballer Neymar has signed a five-year deal with the French football team PSG.
Earlier Thursday night, it was that Neymar's representatives had paid a $222 million exit price to FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish football league.
The $222 million transfer is the biggest transfer in football history.
Previously, the record was Manchester United, which last summer paid 105 million euros for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league stopped transfer earlier Thursday after it rejected Neymar's first payment company.
According to the rules of the league, the team purchased cannot pay the exit price directly to the seller, but the player must buy his contract out by himself, which happens by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives who delivered money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will eventually be presented to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiensia on Saturday.
The UEFI is investigating the details.
Barcelona has also announced that it will provide information on the payment to the European Football Federation (UEFA) so that the Federation can determine the disciplinary measures that may result from the case.
Spain’s leader Javier Tebas has been suspected of breaking the rules of the UEFA’s financial fair game.
The Uefa may punish a successor who makes more than 30 million euros of losses in three years.
According to the Uefa, Neymar’s transfer does not automatically break its economic status.

Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomb attack in the Afghan capital Kabul said a NATO soldier was killed and several others were injured.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul's Qarabaghi area.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month. Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomb attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday after a joint NATO-Afghan army group was attacked by a “person-bossed explosive equipment.”
The statement stated that all the injured were in stable condition and were treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the letter exchangers, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 percent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, where most of them are Shiite Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in the center of Kabul, which was the country's most destructive militant group after the U.S.-led troops dropped the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to the letter exchangers, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people’s confidence in the government, its policy and especially President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA revokes its decision to postpone the implementation of the drainage rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of emissions reduction decisions made during Obama's administration a day after 15 states had appealed to the agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called “self-definitions” for 2015 late on Wednesday, according to the Agency, the decision is a proof of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
“We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states,” CEO Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the agency intends to postpone the implementation of the ozon determinations for one year to October 2018.The determinations indicate that the dive emissions will be measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where the pollution should be reduced further in accordance with the stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency appealed to the court in 15 mainly democratic states, including District of Columbia.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to mitigate Barack Obama’s environmental regulations, according to Trump, the measures are part of a wider economic growth programme.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmental defenders, who are worried about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA’s website, the ozon-containing air breathing “can undermine the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of the Islamic State had also sent bombing parts to Sydney.
The suspect said the bomb was intended to be brought to the aircraft on 15 July, but the company stopped before security inspections.
The police don’t know exactly why the company stopped.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build an uncolored toxic gas detoxifying device and bring the device to a precise public place, for example, in public transport.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that has ever been made in Australia.
Four of the suspects were arrested on Saturday after a police session.
One man has been released, but his interrogations are also ongoing.

CEO Matti Lievosen said the company made good results in oil products, the sales of renewable products rose to a record level and the marketing and services segment’s business profit development was in the right direction.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss the possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a match toward the most interesting match in the near future of the 66.7 kg series, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC’s unbeatable light series champion Mikey Garcia walked along the corridor to greet Lomatchenko, WBO’s top dust series champion.
Garcia won on Saturday at Showtime with a unanimous decision by former four-class world champion Adrien Broner. After that, Garcia and Lomatchenko have been among the top five in a list of matchers from different weight classes.
Garcia stretched his right hand and asked, “How is it, master?
Good luck in the match!”
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday.
When the twin poseed to the photographers, Lomatchenko’s manager Egis Klimas noted that the match between men would be “perfect for the couples.”
“I’m a former cowboy,” Garcia recalled.
“I moved the series for the top [63.5 pounds] Bronier, but I’m not so big.
I am a small 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to the light.
He has to rise to a light line [61.2 pounds]. Then we can take it.
That is what our fans want.
To fulfill their wishes.”
Lomatchenko was agreeing.
“The competition needs this match.”
Klimas asked if the match should be organized via the payment channel. This is part of the strategy he prepared for Lomatchenko, according to which Lomatchenko debuted in the light series later this year and will play next summer against Garcia (37–0, 30 wins). Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will play in the light series at the Forum on September 23.
“The match could be a payment channel because fans have asked for it,” Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to play on a channel that offers the best prize package.
We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts so much attention.
I think it’s good as soon as I get into a deal.”
Garcia said he appreciated Lomatchenko as a "unbelievable player" and intends to go to watch the match on Saturday.
Lomatchenko stopped Garcia’s bowling and said that this three-class master from Riverside seemed “truly slow.
Garcia said he focused first on showing the strike and then on betting.
The men said they felt that the match between them was wanted to be done more and more strongly.
“This is the match we are expecting.
No other game will raise so much attention and interest.
I’m definitely involved in this story,” Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he was waiting to win against the best. ”Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
The average salary of €5,300, education what happens - the situation of investment counseling was "will and free"
The quality of investment counseling has spoken a lot in recent times.
Lastly, the Helsingin Sanomat about Ritva, 68, to whom the investment adviser of the bank movement spoke a full puppy when selling investment products.
Investment advisors and the rules for the sale of various investment products will be strengthened by the beginning of next year.
Strengths are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will be implemented from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the expertise of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
No knowledge requirements are defined in the law.
The Finance (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete it with their own APV1 or APV2 graduate.
The financial sector has authorized the organization of degrees to a company named APV Investment Examinations Oy, whose study group consists of experts from both the Financial Supervision (Fiva), universities and industry actors.
The degree range is 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE or Aalto University Executive Education Ltd, which provides business management development services.
Its website says that, in general, both exams are "very broad in terms of requirements".
The degree learning material includes 10-15 books as well as a number of other guides and works.
The CEO of APV Investment Examinations Oy, Markku Savikko, says that the percentage of passing the exams is severely estimated at about 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, almost all the providers of investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 graduates, as their completion is mandatory according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banking movements without mentioning the names, the staff of which affects the completion of the degrees, Savikko says.
According to him, such banking movements are “changed”.
According to Savikon, APV1 graduates have completed 13,000 to 14,000 people since 2000 and approximately 3,000 people have completed APV2 degrees recommended for more demanding investment advisors.
Some banking institutions consider completion of a degree to be an advantage.
Several other industries have significantly stricter knowledge requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Finance sector requires the completion of APV degrees, because then the expertise related to the investment sector is guaranteed.
According to the Statistics Center, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros a month, including commissions, natural benefits and income payments.
The average monthly regular working hours of employees is approximately €5,300.
Working men earn an average of €5,900 per month and women more than €4,500 per month.
The ten most winning people earn an average of about €8,100.
A dozen of the most winning men earn more than €9,000 a month or more, and a dozen of the most winning women earn €6,400 or more.
Investment advice according to the Investment Services Act can only be granted by the authorised company.
The employee level and tasks have so far been confident in self-regulation.
According to Fivan, the inspection it carried out addressed individual cases in which the professional skills and qualifications of the investment adviser were not sufficient on the basis of the activity of the adviser.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if your professional skills and qualifications are at a good level.
In this context, the situation has been wild and free.
More industries have significantly stricter knowledge requirements, Savikko says.
According to Savikon, from the beginning of next year, this will be strengthened with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each company is responsible for providing investment services with sufficient skill.
The financial supervision, in turn, has the power to determine what to know.
Fivan Market Supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the present is the legislation on the requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovin, the new requirements apply both to the own staff of investment firms and to the stakeholders who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva gets the authority to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be determined by these prospects in the coming autumn.
The company will also continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and supplementary training.
This must be documented, and the company has the obligation to prove that this has also been done.
In practice, the company must, for example, map the staff’s actions at an individual level.
This will come to different levels of demand depending on whether it is an investment consultation or the sale of products.
According to Hovin, new is also the requirement to work with someone more experienced for a deadline, if the knowledge or experience is not at a sufficient level.
That is, if a company employs a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with the person that meets the criteria for a certain time.
With the change, the rules are strengthened and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be strengthened by the beginning of 2018.

An unknown soldier is sold with bathrooms - "There's such an interconnected story"
Every way you see it.
The Cleaning Products Blue Products launched the Unknown Soldier product series a few days ago.
Then printing clothes and washing clothes - as well as "wc shirt with a round shirt".
An unknown soldier is referring to the film and leaf marketing that he receives in this autumn.
Nevertheless, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been drawn up on social media: When are the Unknown Health Sites coming?
You need to call the company and ask what the question is here.
What does the Blue Product Deputy Director say?
We are a film partner.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says Määttä.
According to him, the products will be released with a special display, and the film will thus get visibility.
Isn’t there something a little funny here – often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a conjunctive story that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products, says Määttä.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish basic values that are supported by those who have seen the Old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to the army culture, Määta notes.
Other business partners of the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichytes have been introduced to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already recorded to be withdrawn by Finnish Kuvalehden blogger Kalle Kinnunen
There are also coffee and clocks available.
It is clear that there is still time for the film to start, so the continuation is still permitted.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products such as Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail supply chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
The new results of the age test for Swedish asylum seekers
The latest results of the medical age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out by a new assessment method reveal that more than 80 percent of those tested were determined to be over 18 years old. However, not all consider the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Judicial Medicine Agency started the test earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Authority was criticized for failing to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed themselves to be minor.
The Immigration Agency has so far conducted 6,880 tests, and the Agency for Legal Medicine has now published 2,481 tests. The tests were conducted between the middle of March and the end of July in 2017.
The 80 percent of the tested, i.e. 2002 asylum seekers, were found to be over 18 years old. Additionally, the agency for judicial medicine determined in 25 cases that the tested was “possibly 18 years old or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the asylum applicant was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the applicant’s indicated age.
Johan Göransson of the Office of Legal Medicine says that the results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
“The figures are quite consistent. big differences from the statistics of the previous months are not noticeable,” he told The Local.
Although the majority of applicants were determined to be over the age of 18, it may not necessarily mean that the applicants had lie about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and that in 442 cases there were “signatures that the examiner is 18 years old or older.”
When the Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it was revealed that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 this year.
In the medical age assessment method used in the tests, X-ray images of the wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knees are taken. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method is also criticized.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist of the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work includes an assessment of human biological maturity. The assessment can determine whether a person has become the normal age earlier or later.
“I’ve had a reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right way.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are unable to determine the age, we should not pretend that we are able to do so,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the agency for legal medicine Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test must soon reach the age of 18, then the risk is about 10 percent.”
In Scotland, it falls 30 seats.
Five over pair results in the third round spent Mikko Ilosen’s 30 points with a result slope down in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left the 11th place on Saturday, but at the end of the round found the 41st place.
In a difficult hole, there was one double-bowl with three gods.
The others were difficult.
Englishman Ian Poulter went up to share the top on one under a pair round, even though he said that it was enough to work on the shadows.
Keli was raw, but I ran along and eventually the day was good, Poulter stumbled.
He shares the top with his landman Callum Shinkwin and the Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia Changes Party
West Virginia's Democratic Governor, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday afternoon that he will change a party.
“Democrats simply rejected me,” Justice said.
“Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough consideration...Today I will tell the West Virginiaans that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democrats.”
The public sparked for a popularity.
“From tomorrow I will be a registered member of the Republican Party,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I’d tell you that it’s time for a new game.”
Trump has previously promised that a significant announcement will be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected Governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He recruits a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
The National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) published a statement on Thursday afternoon, according to which “Governor Justice’s party exchange is again a new attack on a democratic party that prefers to build barriers than a better America.”
“Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. in this situation, the Justic’s announcement is the last backdrop for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive message that connects people,” RNC representative Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Mystery Says Damage - Thursday Will Be Even Summer's Very Bad Day
In the end of the week, there will be a lot more in South Africa.
During the past week, it has fallen especially in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Varsinais-Finland.
In the evening between Wednesday and Thursday, a number of firefighters were burned.
Meteorologists say Thursday may be a great summer day.
Finally, it has also been found in Finland.
During the past week, there has been collapse, especially in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Real Finland.
On the table, the blast hit the linehouse into the electricity center, causing a small fire.
The rescue was about the fire on Wednesday afternoon.
The electricity center was located in a sauna near the rivital.
The rescue department broke the roof and the wall to find firefighters and shut down the fire.
A total of 11 houses remained without electricity, but human injuries were avoided.
In Loima again, the blast burned the outer building in the airbags at Harjulanti before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in the full fire stage, and the rescue facility could only prevent the spread of the fire.
A building of about 50 square meters has burned on the ground.
In the direction of the cave, a blast again hit the home.
The inhabitants were outside the building and witnessed a striking strike.
The rescue department came to the site to check the incident, but this time the fire did not result in a fire - only a few firefighters broke down.
In traffic, the wing caused problems on the railroad between Seinäjoen and Vasa, when the crash damaged the traffic control system.
The error was on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was solved only a little before 5 a.m.
Since then, the train traffic has been able to continue normally, also on the runway part.
The mysteries have sowed destruction throughout Finland.
However, it has been relatively low this summer.
This year’s weather has been a great deal! says the meteorologist Jari Tuovinen of the Weather Institute.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the storms have been mostly moderate in their intensity, but thanks to the low salamasald of the summer, it also feels strong for many.
This might seem very hard, but that’s what it has been compared to this summer, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the landscapes broke 1,700 times, and on Thursday there has been potential for even the hardest day of the summer: around 16:00 there were 1,790 landscapes in the plateau.
If the blurry still continues to the beginning of the night, then you can get more than two thousand blurry, the Provider predicts.
The previous record record was in 2015, when the number of deaths in the year was approximately 30,000.
By Wednesday, the number of deaths this year had increased to 18,386.
This year, however, we will not be able to break the two-year record.
However, the outskirts can continue.
In the end of the week, it will also remain warm and wet, which is a suitable birth-environment for cattle.
The main weight of the windows will move from the northern parts of the country to the south, where you can get about 2,000 salma days both on Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the country there is a more unified sadding.
According to them, it is only a few.
Coe praises Russia's "absolute" apology for doping scandal
World Sports Ambassador Sebastian Coe openly praised the apology that Russia submitted for the doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to terminate the Russian prohibition.
Russia's general sports leader Dmitry Shljahtin said at the IAAF congress that the prohibition received by Russia is appropriate and that he intends to struggle determinedly against doping.
He said he’s regretted “for all the athletes from whom a gold or a silver medal was removed in the competition.”
Russia was excluded from public sports competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA’s report had shown evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
“I think his response today was very straightforward. it was a fairly open presentation,” IAAF Chairman Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Sports Federation admitted that the country has passed through difficult times and announced that it will do everything to reorganize its activities."
Coe also said he was “rejoiced” that Russia accepted the terms of terminating the ban.
“I think we had a well-constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group’s recommendation that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes apart from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nine Russian athletes are competing for the status of a neutral athlete at the World Cup of Public Sports, which starts on Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
“The test is still insufficient, and the coaches who have been banned continue to operate freely,” he told reporters on Friday after the IAAF Council’s presentation in London.
The production company deceived Tom of Finland's poor success
The Tom of Finland film did not have the success that the authors wished, says Yle.
If honestly, I’m disappointed, I admit the film was produced by Helsinki Film’s director Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish filmmaker might be a conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was released in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached fair 100,000 viewers, which is the film’s budget, about five million euros, compared to a little.
There is no lottery profit from this, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had succeeded better in the country, they would have already got their money.
Now we have to wait for small breakdowns from external spreads, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How Football's Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transfer to Paris
The regulations that restrict the use of money from the European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring from Spain Barcelona to France Paris Saint-Germain.
The possible sanctions against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the European football regulator UEFA, which may prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, the UEFA adopted a fair game regulation that states that the PSG must be able to prove that Neymar’s transfer has been funded without significant losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros for the conclusion of the Brazilian deal, and Neymar's annual salary in the new team moves in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a variety of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar’s transfer and attaching him to his star card, as it follows funding Qatar’s oil-rich rulers.
The teams can use large amounts to acquire players, but they must be balanced with real income sources so that the football-related business is not losing.
The Financial Rules for Fair Play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platin, who was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that seeking success with debt was a fraud and led to serious problems if the banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, the focus on fair game economic rules passed from the debt of the associations to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly complicated. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent enormous amounts on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the rules of the fair game will last until 2018; during that period the associations will be able to make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini was forced to leave the UEFA chairman in 2015 scandalously, his followers, Alexander Ceferin, also want to hinder the untouched money use of the associations.
“The rules of the game are still in place, and we will apply them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, the UEFA’s financial regulator for fair game, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a single compensation, it may pay the amount in the accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded for an annual expenditure of €44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on the financial rules of fair play, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014.The greatest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of €60 million, which was later reduced to €20 million. Additionally, the team was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is monitoring associations that may try to overcome its financial regulations by increasing their revenue through associated companies with the association owners.
For example, if a Qatar company supports PSG but the value of the support is considered to be higher than the standard level of the market, the UEFA will not count the support as a real result.
This happened when the UEFA decided in 2014 that Qatar’s tourism authority’s support to PSG was exaggerated.
It has also been revealed that part of Neymar’s earnings in the PSG could be funded by payments available from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup Organization Board.
However, the PSG and the arrangement committee have forbidden Neymar to be a world championship ambassador.
Due to PSG’s previous sanctions, the UEFA is also more closely monitoring attempts to round the rules.
The sources said on Thursday that the UEFA has not negotiated with the PSG about Neymar’s transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity will not be revealed because they have no authority to discuss the situation in PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, PSG’s turnover in the period 2015–2016 was EUR 542.4 million and business profits over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements of the past year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of follow-up products and games.
The trade union estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 percent with Neymar’s agreement.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated by the departure of the world's best player, tried to make Neymar's transfer difficult. It was alleged to violate the economic rules of fair play.
“This is a clear economic doping incident for both the coalition and the state,” the Spanish league chairman Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also reserves that the state is funding the activities of the football club. Arsenal owns an American sports base.
“The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
There are so many interests associated with the fact that a famous player represents the state.”
Finland's World Cup athlete trainer stuck in Helsinki
Long-speaker Arttu Pajulahden and three-speaker Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, although he should train the general sport at the World Cup in London.
Christina Mäkel may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
The game will compete tomorrow in the lengths and the game will compete on Saturday in the triangles.
However, the two coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter at the British Embassy without a result.
The coach has the invitation of the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but he has also not been eligible for a visa.
Is this the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully dealt with visa matters in the past, but now there are some problems.
He will do his best to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Union SUL for years.
It is not so important.
When someone looks at the stadium the steps toward him, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about the possible dismissal.
World Cup in London requires a miracle
The World Cup starts on Friday in London and lasts a fair week and ends on Sunday, August 13.
Public sports, land skiing and ice hockey are the species to which Finnish penny athletes can be attracted passionately from year to year, whether success or not.
In the hearts of the penny athletes, success is measured in medals.
There are other measurements.
Less observed are the beautiful growth stories of young athletes, from awards to awards, where acquiring experience matures the performance of the athlete to the level that the adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
There are no young athletes in the world, and there are no young athletes in the world.
The World Cup requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the sport’s interest and surprising is that miracles can happen.
It pulls the penny athletes to the television line and lies to watch the matches, although London medals are dissolved due to time break only in the afternoon.
From the previous World Cup 2015 Finland won one pronsimital.
It was brought by the long-lasting Tero.
The faithful are waiting for a long medal now, although the other is told by the results of his and other thieves in recent times as well as the stay of the long medal in the last summer awards.
Regardless of the events, Longkämäki remains a great Finnish sports hero in history.
For other Finnish athletes, entering the final competition or making their own record is a good performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal leader of the Finnish general sport for the coming years will give good success in the international awards for young people this summer.
The development of young people’s talents and the financial support of their work is more important than the maintenance of a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in a moment but requires years of hard work from athletes and patience from both training and penny athletes.
Finals can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique achievements.
I hope the London matches will remain in history as the matches of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not, for example, because of terrorist fear or brutal attacks.

Viking Line's new fast boat crashed in Helsinki
The equipment company Viking's new fast-boat FSTR is seriously delayed from schedule.
The long ship had to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 18 p.m.
There were eight ships on board.
The ship arrived in Helsinki very late.
I’ve been waiting for a half hour to get to the ship.
Now the motorcycle is moving a bit, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is waiting for access to the ship in the port of Helsinki, said at 19.30.
Rebane believed the new vessel had a technical failure.
Rebane said the equipment company had brought water bottles to the ship to their cars waiting for access.
Viking’s communication chief Christa Grönlund told IS that it had a technical failure.
It was repaid in the port of Helsinki.
The ship departs from Helsinki a few hours later.
Grönlund says the ship will also be delayed from the return trip to Tallinn for a couple of hours.
The ship had to depart from Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20:15 p.m.

The Little Circle Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously shines both the 80-s glorious days of the characters and the 90-s grunge (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made the glorious The State series for MTV) and their own time – the year 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved to their career to bigger stories.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous memory that we have immersed in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels already alive in its time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (this, among other things, was told by the voice of H. Jon Benjamini to speak the background of the vegetable).
The foundation of the joke is that middle-aged actors play a pleasant tune that approaches the age. The emphasis on it makes the impossibility of achieving the past part of a joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodiates, for example, the 90's stalkers, such as the horror film The Hand Who Calls to Spy.
In one point, one of the characters covers the Apple Powerbook, the inline rollers and the “Other Shadow of 1991”.
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet passed over Kathy (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in a crazy line, Ronald Reagan (as well as Michael Showalter) is involved as a criminal partner George H. W. Bush (who plays Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side bulbs.
It’s fun to see Paul Rudd, who has a puppy under the bottom, Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” from the movie Singles.Rudd’s role Andy, the king of the camp, begins to be an old mother.
Moments of accidental madness may raise this series into a reverse series of Seven Up! until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series once again points to a different kind of nostalgia: The Americans’ Cold War Spirit, Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series, where the East encounters the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas. It was made as a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, where a Bucharest couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
In the main roles as the hard-named Gregor and the idealist Joseph are seen by Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their words are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a great idea,
But much more it is not.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police spend time watching television shakes in the same way the Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, remains too tight to the imitation of a cough socialist drama – accompanied by, for example, a murderer hiding behind the Reagan namer.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or abundant.
A compressed series could better act as an agitprop satir, even when Gregor and Joseph visit the U.S. Embassy repeatedly and in the hall there are always two fat men stumbling the hamburger.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything consumer and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we stumbled our own nearby history and their history as well.
Kouvolan Toni Tauru will rise to the frame on Saturday in Macao - against former UFC player
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macao as the Brazilian Leandro Issa played in the UFC last year.
The Brazilian has a black belt and a world championship.
I’m fighting myself against my older man.
It’s a funny story, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvolan had to rise to the frame in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three matches were delivered on a timetable to China's autonomous area in Macao.
This has not been the case before.
This was the first time my match was canceled.
It irritated, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
The player is pleased to have a new time for the match.
Waiting for a week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition because it does not improve per week.
Your fitness can get worse if you are exercising too much.
In a few previous battles, Tauru has encountered opponents whose strengths are in reversal.
This time the situation is different.
The bracelet is typical to the Brazilian.
He is a very aggressive player.
I guess he comes in the first stage hard on and tries to take it to the roof.
He has won the world championship, so he knows how to press.
The previous match was not as planned.
The Philippine Kevin Belingon striked Tauru to the eye, and the victory remained to the Philippines.
I’ve never taken it so well, especially right: he didn’t get a hit.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
It hurt for a long time.
The new motivation
Some of the freelancers play once a year, some rise to the frame more tightly.
For example, the future opponent Issa played the last time in September.
Last year there were three matches.
There is a second battle this year.
Sometimes it has become pregnant.
I’ve been training and I’ve been in good condition all the years.
I’ve got it just because of the match.
When the 32-year-old heard about the next meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training and got the pleasure of doing it back.
We had a very good training with a friend from Sweden.
Exercise was a great help, because on Saturday the cowboy will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to train against the same size opponents and practice verticals.
The game is a 32-year-old tactic.
You have to beat reasonably.
If there is an opportunity, I will go to the town.
It is not possible to give the subway services free of charge because they consume the most.
Macao attracts the Taura previously taken in China.
It is known as Las Vegas in China.
I think there is a great and great evening.
The Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 percent.
The Central Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep the interest rates unlikely as economic growth has been pointless and inflation mildness has stopped speculations on interest rates.
The central bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue slowly. the bank moved interest rates because the income level of families is under increased pressure.
The decision makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee decided to hold the interest rates at 0.25 per cent by 6 to 2 votes.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank dropped its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 percent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 percent. It also warned that the income level of households will be under increased pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to three percent in the autumn.
According to the bank, interest rates will be reduced in the coming years to mitigate the inflation accelerated by Brexit.The bank also said that the loans costs may have to be increased more than expected on the financial markets.
Moreover, the committee members decided to withdraw a part of the massive economic package, which was implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme program in February 2018, although it is expected to provide discount funding to banks by 15 million pounds more, which is a total of 115 million pounds.
According to the monetary policy committee’s forecast, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as the decline of real income in households will reduce consumption.
As regards the interest rates, the bank repeated that inflation is needed to “in some degree strengthen the monetary policy” with the expectations of the market “a much broader”.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that possible increases are “degreeal” and “limited”.
In May, the bank forecasted a growth of 1.9 percent for this year and a growth of 1.7 percent for the next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The price dropped against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound declined by 0.5% and was $1.31. compared to the euro it declined by 0.4% and was €1.11.
The decision to keep the interest rates alike was made after weaker growth expenses matched increased interest expectations.GDP increased by 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 0.2 percent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but to slow down slightly by the end of the year.
Its latest inflation assessment gave only a little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wages rise.The bank says the situation will worsen even before it becomes better.
The bank added that monetary policy “can’t prevent” the decline of income in the coming years. However, it expects that wages will recover “significantly” at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound. It will abolish a portion of private consumption by the impact of the decrease.
The decision was made a year after the interest rates were lowered to 0.25 percent after the shocking EU referendum result, which led to a drop in the pound.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to appear in prices and in the economy only in four years.
Before the central bank's latest decision, the interest rates had begun to demand increasingly loud as inflation increased the pressure on households. Three decision makers demanded a interest rate of 0.5 percent in July.
Inflation fell last month to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the Bank it was as expected and inflation will rise again in the coming months.
According to the bank, its two-percent target level exceeding was “completely” due to a weak pound.
“Given the recent drop in swap interest rates, the competition in the housing debt market would seem to intensify further as creditors hotly seek customers and want to end the year strongly,” says Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
“The market looks good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. New contracts are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low and there are also useless options available.”
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients can be prescribed a “transitional” HIV drug. The Supreme Court resolved a dispute concerning the financing of the drug in the English Public Health System (NHS).
NHS that pre-exposure inhibition therapy (PrEP) was prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Pre-sex medication has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86 percent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the court held the highest court's last year's ruling. According to it, the NHS will be able to pay the PrEP medicine, although it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
England’s NHS chief Simon Stevens called the announced decision “a significant new intervention,” and the National AIDS Organization described it as “a decisive important moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registrations for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scale in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure inhibition (PrEP) is a HIV drug to be taken before intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
The drug to be taken before sexual intercourse means that the body has enough drugs during sexual intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes homosexuals, bisexual men and transgender as well as people with a HIV-positive partner who does not receive effective treatment.
Clinics select the test conditions to meet applicants from men, women and transgender and those whose HIV-positive partner is unknown to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and registered for general doctor's treatment can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the NHS of England signed a drug contract this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of the PrEP drug by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementing treatment.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing diverse and increasingly functioning methods to prevent HIV,” says Stevens.
“This is another significant achievement in the struggle for more than 30 years to address the major health challenge of mankind.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” says Deborah Gold, head of the National AIDS Organization.
“If the PrEP treatment is properly targeted to those who need it and belong to the risk group, it may have a reversive effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting from September, those belonging to the risk group will receive a NHS-financed experiment with a drug that they can decide on their use independently without having to negotiate with a partner.
This was a good news.”
“Now the most important thing is to ensure that the experiment is quickly launched throughout the country and no one in the risk group is out of it,” says Ian Green, head of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The drug PrEP used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people in the risk group from HIV infection.”
“The start of the PrEP test is a welcome event that lasted unnecessarily for several months due to the government’s slowdown,” says Sharon Hodgson, Secretary of Health of the Shadow Government.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a reversive effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us better understand the real benefits of the drug.
Now it is important that the experiment will be launched as soon as possible throughout the country. thus we can protect those exposed to HIV and get a step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has managed to stop.”
Quality of life: the middle floor and smart interior solutions have made the small apartment of Earl's Court a spacious home
Ex-banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl’s Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the style house of the Queen Anna era. The success of the Remont tells the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her struggles and changed.
“Then before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridg in a much larger apartment,” Joanne says.
“I’m looking for something similar in my price class.
I went here at the exhibition of the apartment and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my then apartment.
I admired it immediately and made the offer the same day.”
After that, about 90 square apartment has experienced a complete transformation.
It was a double room where the bedroom was only accessible from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space as well as an intermediate floor so that the room height could be exploited.
“I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
It was my requirement,” he says.
He hired Erfan Azadin from the Duck & Shed Design Office in Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to take advantage of the space of four meters high rooms and create an apartment that would not only be a repair and sale destination but a home.
The room height was not enough for two overcovered rooms, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where it could stand.
The solution demanded a creative thinking from Erfan.
“The steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged so that there was no need to be cycling.
The structures were to be modified in such a way that the height is exactly suitable both above and below them.”
Erfan was able to place two full-high rooms in the space with fascinating details.
In the middle floor, Retrouvio's copper-shaped window opens for a stylish stay mode.
Mirror-gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lights create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theatrality, space sense and light.
The mirrors on both sides of a short corner make the corner look beyond the real.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window from which a view to another room is opened.
In the mirror furniture of the entrance there is a storage space for the foods and glass goods of Joanne.
The style increases the fact that the kitchen is hidden when it is not used.
The kitchen is not a new solution.
But the unique thing in the kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the door of the garage.
“It took a bit of design,” Erfan tells the steel-powered MDF bridge.
“It is balanced, that is, it lies very easily when lifted.”
With the intense use of the space and the design of the storage room, Joanne received 16 additional squares, a second bedroom and a better base solution.
“When selling an apartment, the area decides – or the value of the property,” Erfan says.
“In the basic case, the real estate broker enters the apartment and decreases the price based on the area.”
In the river apartment, the surface area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the room.
“The resident is in touch with the materials of the apartment, and the sensation to the apartment is partially based on them,” Erfan says.
“There’s no one in the walls of electricity.
They are important, but not the same way.”
The river apartment is an example of the fact that good design and supplementary buildings can make the basic apartment exceptional fine.
It can also happen that you don’t want to change the apartment anymore.

She grows us with a sweet chili cera
In the summer of 1996, a house appeared on the Lake Tower where Thai food was sold.
The Latvians did not dare to taste, but walked through.
The food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, acquainted with Panja.
He did not know much of Finland, and the Finns did not yet know Thai at the time.
Because the people didn’t dare to go to eat, Panja offered free snacks.
This is how he taught the Taliban to eat Thai food, a spring cake at a time.
The country, he said.
I was stumbled from the lawn.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai shop in the shopping hall of Lahde.
There were two small tables, the customer seats seemed to be less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the ventoviera.
When there is hunger and places limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
Soon we met better and we became friends.
Finally I sat next to the table with a dictionary and taught Thai.
Two years passed on the side of the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to be changed, because the smells made by themselves were said to smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the closure.
There is space.
Now we judges can sit again at our own tables, only in the most troubled times we have to ask the guests if there is room next to us.
He knows his client.
He is told where he has gone and who has been seen.
They know what food they eat.
He has seen how the stages of the lives of customers are changing and the food sort is changing.
She remembers what the name of the man I went to eat my first spring cake.
She remembers me weak and fat, and remembers how I was young.
It’s a pleasure to go for lunch a little later than others, to sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and to exchange patterns with the stumbling Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili cake.
He has opened our tastes in addition to our thoughts and our hearts.
Today, many people talk to him Thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panama.
Although he has had difficulty, he is always friendly.
He is hard.
At the restaurant, he goes in the fungus and black.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated the two-year anniversary.
Our customers got a cake for dessert.
Without warning or attention, this important day passed, at work.
Discovered underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
Since the beginning of the year, security authorities have received a significant list of anti-terrorism work.
The list contains the data of more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons and the document contains not only their personal data but also photos of each.
More than 130 of the people listed are Iraqi, but there are also six European citizens.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The night-News told the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains are accurate.
According to the newspaper, special forces of the Iraqi army found a list of the terrorists’ personal data and photos while investigating the terrorist organization’s underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
In the background there was fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the ISIS collapse in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list contains not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented undertakes and information about the person’s home country.
The list also identifies the special areas of terrorists.
For example, for the 27-year-old Sami J. on the list, the battle name is Abu Assid al-Almani, i.e. the German.
He is to have left Germany in 2012 traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya, and then through Turkey to join the ISIS borders.
Alongside his picture is written a special suicide bomber.
There is no more detailed information about the fate of the man.
There are approximately 6,000 terrorists who have fled from Europe to the Islamic State, the fate of which is uncertain.
A man dropped under the surface in Helsinki
According to the rescue interview, the man wanted to show that he was able to swim.
It can save a dying life.
A man was rescued under water on Thursday.
The Helsinki rescue department’s firefighter Ville Estlander said the situation had passed quickly.
The person was found under the water about 15 minutes after the notification.
A rescue submarine found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue service received the notification after 4 p.m.
The person was delivered to the first treatment.
Estlander says it was a 50-year-old man.
On the basis of the interviews, the man wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The situation on the coast is over.
Estlander congratulates the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
This was the task of the Border Guard.
The locals also guided the swimmers greatly.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars collided in Euras: nine people in the car, three seriously injured
A total of nine people were in the car, the rest were slightly injured, the firefighter said.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at a crossroads of four hours a day.
The crash occurred when the other car turned behind the warning triangle in front of the other car, the firefighter said.
According to the rescue agency, the crossroads have a speed limit of 80 km/h.
Brothers fight for $500 million in real estate
Two brothers complain about Victoria's largest real estate empire worth more than $500 million. The dispute is associated with a family business that their Italian family founded 40 years ago.
Former Carlton Football Association chairman and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toronto value area only three houses away from his younger brother Paul.
Paul has planned to leave the family business since 2014, but the divorce is a terrible dispute.
Brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth more than a half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded there the Westco Jeans store, which expanded to 160 movement chains.
The trade chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centers.
According to the contract concluded with the family’s dead father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company’s wealth and Paul describes his father as “the family’s carrier and central driver.”
According to legal documents, the asset share ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul worth about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the share of property and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,” Paul wrote in his first voluntary certificate for the court in 2015.
The case was discussed in the Supreme Court for the first time on Friday after a number of mediation companies.
Brothers now also argue about who runs the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
According to Colin, the claim is not true. He accuses Paul of poor care of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first voluntary testimonies that he would like to get a solution to the matter.
“According to our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing for me,” Colin said in a statement.
There are hundreds of pages of voluntary statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the country’s best and most experienced lawyers, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicious shops at the end of the 1950s.
They were used as a family assurance when purchasing a property from Collingwood, where Colin founded the family’s first bark shop.
Colin says he founded the store “in the last years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons in a suitable manner.
“Luigi often said he doesn’t want the brothers to come to trial,” Anna writes in a statement.
The family’s two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group’s business. according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are “breaking out of their financial conditions.”
Colin hasined a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian Football League board and television star Eddie McGuire's best friend according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Col and Paul De Luti and their lawyers on Friday.
He said in his text message that he can't comment correctly on the matter because it's being treated in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me in court and bring our family to the court,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept the demands of his brother.
“Our father’t want us to dispute in this way,” Colin continued and said he was still hoping that the issue would be resolved.
On Friday the hope seemed out.
“Our case will be resolved in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new staff chief plans to restrict President’s media use.
The others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
The first.
According to the Poltico newspaper, the White House’s new staff chief plans to restrict President Trump’s media use and news surveillance so that the boss will not get in trouble so often.
The reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
“When the White House’s new staff manager John F. Kelly met with the managing staff on his first working day, he took the key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told the White House staff that all the information – both printed and heard in the press conference – must be transmitted through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly’s words are reasonable, but others have tried to limit Trump’s media use and fail.
President Trump has been in a relationship with television for decades – and as president, he is still watching a lot of television.
“If the presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, he was encouraged to show that compassionate media dealt with things more fairly,” Sam Nunberg, who worked as a counselor in Trump’s campaign, told Politico in February.
Politicon reporter Tara Palmeri wrote that “seven former campaign workers say that it is essential for Trump to control his use of Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of fools.”
clearly .
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter would have ever been under control.
Per these campaign workers know something that we other people don’t know—per Trump’s tweet would have been even harder without their efforts.
We’re probably never going to know what kind of messages were missing from Trump.
If his staff has even been able to prevent him from causing problems a few times, their work has not been useless.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing torture.
The problem is partially due to the fact that there are competitive groups in the White House trying to drive their affairs by giving Trump information that supports their views.
In May, Politico wrote that counselors intentionally give the president doubtful information.
The reporter Shane Goldmacher said about one case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say that he may be extremely angry about the newspapers in which he is criticized – especially if they report harmful data failures.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a copy of the news from the GotNews.com site founded by the internet provokator Charles C. Johnson, accusing the assistant staff chief Katie Walsh of several White House data fraud.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to an intimidation, and he had previously spread false accusations and revoked them later.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun the case after reading to ask staff about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then HR chief Reince Priebus and White House’s HR secretary Rob Porter “have tried to introduce a system of document management to Trump.”
What is the result?
Kelly tries the same three months later.
Per he will prove to be a more powerful leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to run his own affairs.
These unchanged facts make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian footballer Neymar has signed a five-year deal with the French football team PSG.
Earlier Thursday night, it was that Neymar's representatives had paid a $222 million exit price to FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish football league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was thus terminated, and he was free to move to the Paris League PSG.
The $222 million transfer is the biggest transfer in football history.
Previously, the record was Manchester United, which last summer paid 105 million euros for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The team is headed by former Tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen explains alcoholism and flight gambling with hypnosis: "I'm in good way in my life"
From the TV series Rose Time and Pure White Lakes famous successful writer Raija Oranen spent just his 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Orasta.
Five babies love grandmothers so as they take the writing, that Raija and her husband Jyrki leave the Spanish sun and the apartment of Fuengirola after 18 winters.
In the beginning they sold their house, but now in the spring the rental apartment also left.
To the light and to the sun, out of the old circles, Raija brought a time of depression and alcoholism, from which she has survived.
The outer nature is 20 pounds lighter.
Weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were antipsychotics.
I got the help of alcoholism once from hypnosis, which also hit the flight game, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes man, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for more than 45 years.
I can better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has worked in Raija and the tourism industry, has been together for more than 40 years.
I swallowed, and it was going to get married in two weeks, Raija laughed.
Such a drama queen she has always been, ceased her life for that, Jyrki laughs to her wife.
A lot of writer's career made by Oranen remembers only the good 44-parts of the Pure White Lakes TV series that touched and moved the long-time Finland.
I finally decided to become an industry in the clothing industry of the Raika family company when I read the 50-year interview of Liisa Seppälé on the plane.
I was my own daughter, my mother also had a clothing business and I sometimes act as a manicine, Oranen reminds.
The story and the story of the series changed Finnish people’s attitude to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s investigation and the argument revealed it, says Oranen.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, he has many manuscripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
The crowds have returned to the “millionaire shape”
The wealthiest belonging to the West Midlands farmers are again on a large-scale boat with self-covered tourists who managed to cross the countryside's mined coast and return to the field near the houses.
Circulators park their twenty residential trains near the street called the statue of the millioners in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the town's cave cave, which was mined as a passenger water. They brought with them children, horses and the army of packaging cars.
The circlers managed to cross the road in a point that was left unprotected because of the road.
The rageous inhabitants have accused the Solihull municipality of “the complete incapacity to solve the problem.”
An anonymous resident tells the cyclists that they arrived on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passengers with stones.
“The government needs to work hard because it seems completely unable to solve the problem.
The tourists were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today.”
The resident said the city of Birmingham had solved the problem by prohibiting access to the parks.
“I’m on the Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the municipality can’t do anything about it.”
According to another inhabitant who remains anonymous, it is ridiculous that the circlers returned so soon after they were taken away.
“There are more of them than before, and they have even dropped the horse to the park.”
According to a spokesman for the Solihull municipality, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near the Streetsbrook Road. ”We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull police to resolve the campers as soon as possible.
In order to collect evidence, it is very important that as many local persons as possible report to the police of disturbing or criminal activity.
It will help form a comprehensive picture of the situation for judicial proceedings.”
Angry people surrounded the Portuguese aircraft
In Portugal, men who were forced to land on a beach full of people have been interrogated today in court.
As a result, two people died yesterday.
Two men who flown on the plane can be charged with death suspension.
It can be sentenced to 16 years in prison in Portugal.
A man-flying small plane was forced to crash on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon due to a technical failure.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom fled the landing plane into the water.
The plane crashed on a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit a man who was on the back of the plane.
Soon after that, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said Filipe Janeira on the beach to the newspaper Jornal de Noticias.
The young girl was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
The people on the beach surrounded the small car immediately after the storm with anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began to search for it, the case witnessed Celia Rocha told the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a wonder that no more people have died.
Two men on the plane were not injured.
The final champion of the World Cup: "Without an accident I't be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning the Finnish Time World Cup gold in banked slalom in the competition held in Canada's Big Whit.
Grand Hamari also won the Cross World Gold in previous matches.
There are already three MM-titles.
Unbelievable MMs!
Two times gold was treated, with a pretty good stick pulled, by telephone reached the Great-Hamari joy.
The 30-year-old complainant thanked his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
According to the majority, the number of species is increasing.
The entire paramount has grown and evolved a lot in recent years.
The differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of new calculators.
I always wonder if I’m going to get a black horse.
Every game has a different winner.
Grand Hamari lost his second foot in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
She had counted enthusiastically from young to young with her friends, and the accident did not bring the desire to get on the edge.
Sometimes I think what life would be without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless.
Those cards are played, which are shared, Great-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to title a serious accident and the loss of the border as a hunt of luck, and the Great Hamari would not do it either.
But he turned the karma difficulty into success.
I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I’t be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Grand-Hamar's largest boarding line was already in collapse.
The roof toward the top came up with real action only after the accident.
When I was young, I trained with friends, and we always killed the X-Games with our enthusiasm.
But they were distant dreams that disappeared with some time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow from there at the X-Games start.
I’t have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a very long life if I stay here to get crazy and shy.
I decided to pull the wheels into the neck and start working.
I would say I’ve succeeded quite well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of the wheelchair player Leo-Pekka Star as an athlete of the year.
The four-fold Olympic winner received his prize at the sports hall held in January.
According to Grand-Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal for the para-sports.
It was a great thing, and the victory was definitely deserved.
This will also open the eyes to the world of sports.
When is the time to launch the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar’s year’s athlete campaign?
We will see it in time.
I try to do my best to succeed.
Still, the Great Hamari has not conquered all the heights he desires.
The next year is a big goal.
The Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
We are going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees investigated the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of the Syrian youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say the end of the Syrian war and the departure of ISIS are the most important things to happen in order for them to be able to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration does not see any change to the Syrian conflict.
The communication chain Burson-Marsteller investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied Arab species’ opinions and attitudes.
This year’s A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey revealed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24 were responded to the survey, half of whom were women and half men.
Half of the interviews were held in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
More than half of young Syrian refugees don’t believe they will return to their homeland in the future.
42% of respondents may think they’re going to return to their homeland and 4% didn’t know how to say.
According to the study, the youth’s decision to leave is most affected by the war in Syria and the ISIS’ presence in the country.
Nearly half (47%) believe that the end of the war is the most influential factor for permanent refuge, while a quarter believes that the most important thing is the departure of the Islamic State.
Only less than a dozen people say that the economic situation is improved or that Bashar al-Assad is leaving Syria.
Military actions do not solve the conflict alone.
The Syrian youth was asked what is the main factor in resolving the conflict.
The majority believes that the end of the war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
Al-Assad’s presidency is a barrier to the peace treaty.
Nearly half of the people believe that political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
To resolve the conflict by means of solely military action is believed only by a fair quarter.
The majority of the Syrian refugee youth see ISIS’s power weakened over the past year, while a fifth of the Syrian refugees experience its power strengthening.
According to respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and generally against terrorism, is that the media communicates to people information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly the same number of people raised military measures and education reform as the primary means.
The majority of people think it is important to create better jobs for young people.
When asked about Trump’s administration’s impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump’s administration.
Almost one in four believes that the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump period.
The opinions are divided on whether Russia and Iran’s participation has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the network in order – his database is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example.
The Spanish company MariaDB develops a “world’s fastest growing” open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not cost users anything, and it can be developed via the internet by any advanced programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they may not necessarily be paid customers.
With the help of the databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and the images are linked to it,” Widenius explains.
Widenius, a technology manager at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who does beautiful hands-on emergency work contributes to the care that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, Oracle lost software to Sun for 7.4 billion dollars.
When the Oracle trading took place, a lot of MySQL developers announced they would leave.
“They didn’t want to work with Oracle, who didn’t give a certain promise about the future of MySQL,” Widenius reminds.
He had already started a company that started developing MariaDB at this stage.
He did not want his life to die.
I hired a couple of the best developers from Sun, so that the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
The foundation was established to monitor the freedom of code development of MariaDB.
“Thro MySQL, these assurances were not made,” Widenius hurt.
Although many have heard of Wideni and MySQL’s billion trade, few Finnish people know anything about MariaDB.
“In recent years, our growth has been about 50 percent per year,” says MariaDB’s economic director Kenneth Paqvalén.
Growth-focused MariaDB does not make any profits yet, and Paqvalén is low in the company’s characteristics.
It reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB is expected to receive orders for 20 million euros.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps in exchanging databases, which can be more than a year long if the customer has used a closed database.
The exchange from MySQL to MariaDB will succeed in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are MariaDB’s paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, and Alibaba Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating systems’ distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
“There are among our customers the world’s largest teleoperators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks,” Paqvalén said.
The database markets are still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is modest compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although the research company Gartner says that the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, in turnover measured, players like MariaDB are still inexhaustive, though rapidly growing scores.
About $50 billion in the database market, open source databases do not survive even a billion.
However, the open source weight cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay anything for these software.
Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on open databases.
Furthermore, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged to open or at least the transition would have begun.
Large companies don’t get new customers because most people choose the next open source.
This has led to the fact that the license fees for commercial databases have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers,” Widenius thinks.
As the exchange of a closed database is difficult, most customer companies have suffered price increases obediently.
"There are a lot of customers for whom it's really difficult to move because their old applications and others are stuck in a closed database," Widenius says.
However, he believes that the size of the customers is getting full.
As the license fees rise every year, the customer, sooner or later, moves to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent compared to the previous, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if desired.
Moreover, many companies are faced with major system changes when they transfer their operations to cloud services.
Many people are changing data base software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Northern Countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB’s funding was the MariaDB’s impact on public IT procurement.
The company has customers in the public sector, for example in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros annually for its databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax benefits more effectively," Paqvalén says.
Wideniusta is concerned about how money is spent in Finland on closed health care systems, when open systems are cheaper, and the buyer is not at the grace of a single software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it is a better way to make the code.
The community helps and does what it does not invent or can do.
The 55-year-old Widenius belongs to another Finnish Linux developer, Linus Torvalds, along with the most famous open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on open source.
I still have 4-5 conversations annually around the world on this topic.
Italy to strengthen its attitude towards NGOs rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue refugees on their vessels in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to operate unless they are committed to complying with the new rules on their operations.
“If NGOs do not commit to the new guidelines, it’s hard to see how they can continue their activities,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
Minnit's warning came a day after Italian authorities had captured a ship of the German Youth Rettet. The crew is suspected to have collaborated with human traffickers, which contributed to illegal migration.
The aid organization, which has only been working for a year, refused to comment on the detailed accusations of Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartos.
“We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area,” the organization said in a statement published on social media.
“We can only evaluate the accusations once we have collected all the necessary information and are able to evaluate the situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet’s Iuventa fleet since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken Russian-speaking refugees directly from human traffickers who re-use the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometers from the coast of Libya. The data appear in the prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have killed the Italian coastal guard, which is monitoring rescue operations in the area.
According to the operational guidelines, ships like Iuventana must be accompanied by an Italian police, which is monitoring the operations.
Only three of nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the guidelines: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
He said on Thursday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause “significant changes or obstacles” to the organization’s rescue activities.
Among those who refused to comply with the guidelines is the Nobel Prize laureate of Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy has decreased dramatically over the past few weeks, which he considers as a sign of the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and the cooperation with the local mayor’s will begin to produce results.
“In recent days, light has begun to appear from the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed that he planned to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
Seasonal worker is suspected of killing his offside in Enontekiö, the suspect was found on the ground - story to the prosecutor
The alleged crime occurred in the city in December last year.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It was previously that both were seasonal workers.
The police said the suspect had fled to the ground with two dogs.
The man was found in a cold ground, and he did not resist when he was arrested.
The guilt must be raised in less than a week.
The case may be discussed in the Court of Appeal in August.
Robert Hardy of Harry Potter and My Whole-Friends is Dead
British actress Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was by the family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, began his acting career at theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in films and television.
Hardy is reminded of the role of Magical Minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and his veterinarian role in the TV series All Hairy Friends based on James Herriot's book.
The popular BBC series was recorded by a total of seven.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for suicide messages
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that allegedly encouraged her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is sentenced to 15 months in prison and five years in a candidate.
Carter was sentenced for murder in June. his son Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
“My family is broken,” Conrad’s father said at the meeting on Thursday.
“My son was my best friend.”
Carter appealed to the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened to 20 years in prison, but his lawyers say both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-colored shirt, listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a crying look to the ground.
“His acts killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“He decided Conrad’s life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act,” the prosecutor continued.
“He has not shown regret.”
Carter’s lawyer said the case was due to “threatening circumstances that Carter is deeply disappointed.”
However, judge Lawrence Moniz believed that Carter’s “age or maturity or even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions.”
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement, in which her mother said, "It doesn't take a day to not kill my beloved son's death.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can deal with all this. I try to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always bear.”
Conrad’s sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that he was “insulted” by the idea that he would never see his brother’s wedding or be a tante for his children.
“It’s painful to lose the person who has been in my life every day since I was born. that pain never relieves,” Camdyn said.
The case seems to be a future prejudice, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that would be a crime to encourage suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car intoxication in 2014.
The incident attracted the kingdom’s attention when it turned out that Carter had in his text messages encouraged his boyfriend to commit suicide.
“Drive yourself, jump from the roof, shoot yourself. I don’t know, there are many ways,” Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Royl over the two weeks before his death.
Just a little before Roy’s suicide, Carter wrote: “You have to do it, Conrad” and “You just have to start the generator, and you’re free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter attracted attention to the death of Roy. The judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British housewife in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox’s opinion paper in which he stated: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO Secretary-General: Russia is the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think I can say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now harder than it has ever been after the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern territory of Ukraine, NATO relations with Russia have deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not get to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can go to a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the aggravation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump was able to point out that the U.S.-Russia gap was even at a dangerous low level.
Trump urged to thank the country’s poor intersection Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Audi will make changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to a rear blow experienced by car manufacturers
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350,000 car software.
BMW’s chief executive said the company believes that “there are more reasonable options than driving restrictions.” he referred to European cities, including BMW’s home city in Munich, which are considering restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about the return.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to the CO2 emission targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emissions-neutral equipment are increasing, making it difficult for cars to be priced competitively.
German automotive manufacturers are being closely monitored, and federal chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of supporting major automotive companies and ignoring the problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors. Volkswagen installed fraud equipment on cars that reduced emissions to conform to the rules in tests.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former termodynamics manager of the Aud Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian, so he can be dismissed to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was traced into a criminal investigation on Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent the European emission requirements. The accusation was based on similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation may significantly undermine Volkswagen’s position: the luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuelan voting begins with big protests
According to the company, the number of voters by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million greater than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role in the election result, the chairman of the National Election Board, Tibisay Lucenan, told reporters.
Maduro says the crisis is over
On Sunday in Venezuela, a controversial vote was held to amend the country’s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organized protests against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has delayed its own demonstrations so that they were ongoing at the time of the appointment.
According to the El Pais newspaper, the country’s national security forces began to take over the country’s parliamentary building on Wednesday afternoon.
The teams are intended to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens the Provence lavender
Laventel has become the symbol of the southern Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Laventel had decreased due to drought and disease-bearing insects. Scientists and farmers are hotly trying to find a solution to the problem.
“Laventele is directly threatened in the Provence region because it has suffered in recent years from the impacts of climate change. This has led to a significant decrease in spring and especially autumn rainfall,” says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute in Provence, specializing in agriculture.
This will shorten the lifetime of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cascades to the area that spread microbes.”
The bets are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient for fragrances and cosmetics.
“Instead of long stars and big flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely missing,” Chaisse says.
“In other words, there are fewer and fewer elements that contain essential oil.”
The solution is sought by enhancing the irrigation, slowing the dehydration of soil humidity and spraying the plants with a protective mixture of straw and water. In addition, more and more dry-resistant varieties are developed.
The murder of a journalist reveals an increasing threat in Mexico
The publication of the Riodoce newspaper once a week is usually gathered on Wednesday to discuss how the newspaper addresses the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security due to the recent tragedy.
Journalists are encouraged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which one is safer: leave the children home or take them to the delivery, which was carried out by a cranate attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the alliance table in the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and feelings are sufficient.
The table contains the names of such narcotic traders, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on the government or drug cartels' salary lists. They are criminals who make news of the Mexican chaos life-threatening.
According to the Reporters Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered after President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.The Federal Protection has 589 journalists being attacked and threatened.
The last victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and source of inspiration.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote together with many of his books on drug violence.
He’s grabbed deeply even though he’s everywhere. The public page of the Riodocen building is covered by an enormous picture in which Valdez shows a central shape. The picture reads: “Right.” Thirty journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts that decorate Valdez’s smileful face. Valdez has glasses and a brand-formed panamate.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death. Journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fear overwhelmed by paranoia.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 specifically for the investigation of journalists' cases, but according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, only two accusations have been raised so far.
The murders of journalists are rarely brought to trial, as well as a few of the thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organized crime each year are brought to trial.
Riodoc’s journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are broken down and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, there is little benefit from the security meeting because the murders are unknown and there is no hope for justice.
“This meeting is straightforwardly a waste of time,” he says.
“We can’t trust anyone until we know the cause of the event.”
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoc in the state's capital Culiacan in the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had been driving on the red Toyota only a couple of cards when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is supposedly associated with the name of the newspaper: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove Valdez away with a car and collapsed it somewhere away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was killed by a wife and two adults.
The noise moves quickly and flows freely in Culiacan.
The death of Valdez is a mouse.
Sinalo has been the most bloody battlefield in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinalo, one or more people are shot dead every day, and on the burial ground there are narcotic paroys decorative two-storey tomb buildings that are larger than many households.
In the coastal state, it is “peaceful” when only one cartridge controls the ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoc, the 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez. He leads a competing group that is going to war against Guzman's sons.
The issue could be shameful for Guzman’s sons: the suspects of being a member of the jing bought each number of the newspaper as soon as the newspaper arrived at the points of sale.
The second mistake was that Valdezia was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a translation point in violence against journalists.
She had survived so much that her friends and colleagues could no longer be afraid for her.
He had had a long career in Noroest when he decided in 2003 to establish Riodocen with five colleagues.
In Sinalo, “It was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the newspaper began to feel courageous and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers fascinated the newspaper with stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Journalists’ Protection Committee for his courage to follow the history of Mexican drug trafficking.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to be able to continue my life,” he said when receiving the Journalist Protection Committee award.
“Drug trade is a way of life in Sinalo,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“The reporter must accept a task that falls on him – or to show a foolish thing.
I don’t want anyone to ask me where I was when death was swallowed here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
The staff of Riodoc need Valdezia – a joke man who cursed like a port worker. They need a friend who has always received praise and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in their routine.
He always used a pancakes.
He went to the bar in El Guayabo and always sat on the same table.
Now they’re asking if the routine came to his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how they can best do their work and survive.
“The criminals don’t like it when we talk about their wives and children and their pure business, their secret narcotraffic praise in our stories.
They were left out of things,” said Bojorquez.
In the best case, it meant strong self-sensure and self-protection.
Trust in your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoc’s reporter Andres Villarreal, is that “the impression can be deceived, and that was the case with Javier.”
The old rules no longer apply in Sinalo, and they no longer apply in Tamaulpas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive traffic routes, weak agencies, and corrupt authorities.
The environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoc's security training was held. A few days earlier it was revealed that only spyware programs sold to the government had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers were searching for a fire from a 40-degree brightness in the shade of a tree.
The state government had ordered them to guard the workshops in Riodoc, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists guessed half in their game whether these two policemen belonged to the 50 percent group that the state governor did not consider reliable.
It has been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside controlled by narcotics.
This week, Riodocen's delivery scheduled three main points.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinalo.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s money was concentrated on the governor’s home city.
Additionally, one of Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a corner away from the prosecutor’s office, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who was kidnapped and how, so it was necessary to move cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). PRI has managed Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
Governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have gained a lot of publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, “El Chapo” Guzman’s son managed to escape and avoid the army’s breakdown.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they received reliable information about the kidnapping from the Valdez column.
“In the past we’d already know what’s happened,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, who’s got the name ‘El Flaco’, Ohukainen, because of his body structure.
Now all the connections to our data sources are broken.”
Valdez’s workroom has been transformed into a warehouse where anti-journalist persecution shells and tables are stored. The newspaper’s employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press freedom activists.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez took with him a few shells when he left the local prosecutor's office next morning for a demonstration, which was caused by a new reporter's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the assassination of Valdez.
After the disappearance, the burned body was found, which, on the basis of the DNA tests made by the authorities, is Adam.
Reporters have begun to protest more loud across the country. Demonstrations show “SOS Press” texts on the foot walks and buildings.
Today, President Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
He has then asked him to be removed from the government's issues because he's worried that he can't be objective.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists are surrounded by organized crime, crime allowed by authorities and indifferent society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that narcotics kill journalists, but they are also killed on the order of politicians and security forces in consensus with organized crime.
According to Article 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed by police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are silent by killing,” Ramirez says.
The murder has a devastating effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulpas border state six years ago.
Within his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: “I am here because of my writings.”
Near his cut head was a computer keyboard and headsets.
Some newspapers have decided to stop their operations, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the drug cartels: “What do you want of us?”
Some of the journalists have fled from their states or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
It’s hard to find a job on the ground, and you have to be cautious all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a journalist in their hands, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – who was once supposed to become a poet – acknowledges that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
“I’ve become a journalist because Mexico is on the way to hell,” he says.
A while ago, Riodoc's journalists sat Friday at midnight in front of the delivery with a footway beer when the newspaper's latest number was finished.
19 people were killed in a shooting between the competing gangs and security forces in the coastal area of Mazatlan.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters posted the news on the Riodoc web site from the foot corner with their smartphones.
The page had to be restored the next day.
The shooters were in the vicinity, a new shooting point.
Bojorquez looked at the police guard:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodocen continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the newspaper under this massive painting, where the man shows the middle size to the whole Sinalo.
Bojorquez says he can’t even consider to stop the operation. ”How can I stop the newspaper when our practitioner asked to go to the street to do things the same day when Javier was murdered?”
Hannu Mannese's Olympic project began with a huge backdrop - "The Hard Place"
In April, the 39-year-old Hannu Mannis' celebrations remained short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the exercise period began catastrophically when Manninen was sick of a flu.
It started a long period of illness, which lasted almost five weeks.
May was almost completely ill.
First there was a flu and finally a kind of childhood disease like ear inflammation, with which I had to eat an antibiotic.
I was able to do only 10 percent of the planned exercises.
I don’t remember when I last suffered so long.
It was a hard place when I didn’t get the exploited exercise, Manninen tells the evening-sanom.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 World Championship was granted a training permit only in the second week of June, which was shown in the KIHU’s Role-Mate Test at the Competition and Supreme Sports Research Centre held on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete slides on a roulette mat, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the matte stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the athlete's finger.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the ground, but now I stayed only 28 minutes.
He came to the wall, he said.
in the better direction
After the initial failure, she said she was healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises with which I have sought to normalize the body’s metabolism.
There is a very good five-week season.
It was also a half-week holiday from the flight morning.
I went to the house with my family too.
Last season, Manninen only participated in four World Cup competitions before the Lahde World Cup home tournaments.
The best result was seen in the opening competition when Manninen rose at the top 18th.
The guidelines are drawn
Manninen and the national team's chief coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan for the next February.
We are looking for a different rhythm now compared to the previous season.
After the first round of the World Cup, Ruka will have three World Cup weekend.
It is expected to take part in at least one World Cup weekend in December, in Ramsa.
At the end of January, they will continue to participate in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that the name will be found on the list of the Olympic team, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics are the sixth Winter Olympics in its career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, Salt Lake City celebrated the golden team competition in 2002.
The Dinosaur Protected His Enemy by Mask
At first it looks terrible.
Now, the researchers have revealed the first findings of a Canadian mining worker’s discovery of a corner-sized creature that was so well preserved that experts call it the dinosaur’s Mona Lisa.
It was so well preserved that the researchers were even able to determine that it had a red-rown skin and had a “problematic past.”
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved dinosaur of all time and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is the nodosaurus, which was in the middle stages of the joint period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well preserved fossil as a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, pansored vegetable food is the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was discovered on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the rocky surrounding, and decided to explore his discovery in detail.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
For six years, there was caught 1 100 kilograms of the block.
The results of hard work are now visible.
“If you scratch your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep,” says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
It remains in the history of the dinosaurs Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Naha studies found that the dinosaurs eating meat were likely to be a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a pansar and it resembled a walking pansar.
Its red-white pansar masks it from the thieves, and it is also protected from the top of a darker and underlying color, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to confuse with its environment and avoid its enemies, bigger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus rose to the titles in May, and it is now displayed at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Borealopella markmitchell museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell belonged to the team that took more than 7,000 hours of mining the dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the shapes and shapes of its body and the pansar.
They discovered that it was protected in the animal world by the general coloring, where the body is more dark on the top and light on the bottom.
The observation was yet a surprise, because Borealopele is significantly greater than current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs who eaten meat captured it to the extent that evolution favoured as a way of survival, hiding instead of fighting.
Today’s animals, for example, pears, seepers and armadillo have a similar coloring. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier hunting, indicating that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
“The catastrophe of a large, strongly pansored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the association period were,” Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the nodosaurus’s fine organic compounds reveals that its skin was red-pink.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to make conclusions about its life. They explore, among other things, the content of its intestines in order to find out what it eats in its last meal.
Scientists believe it fell when it died in the river and moved to the sea, where it drowned back into the sea base.
Albert was as warm at the time as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to spread much further than today.
“This nodosaurus is really significant because its purple skin has been preserved and it has also been three-dimensional in its original form,” Brown says.
That’s why it looks almost the same as in the early association period.
Imagine it does not require much imagination: if you scratch a little eye, you can almost believe it was asleep.”
The period was the era of the teropods, huge two-foot, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years Borealopelts earlier, its magnificent ancestors have been able to catch this pansarized dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, an approximately 11.5 meters long six-ton monster.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus scientists have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealopele was swallowed into the sea after his death and mummiated in the mouth.
It was discovered on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world with skin and pansars from the shell to the lone.
The nodosaurs were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
Their layers raised two and a half meters.
Scientists believe that this pansored vegetable food passed through the present Western Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
His pansar has kept small details in the underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains have been so well preserved that its skin is still left in the pansar's rubbish plates along its curve.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a survival is “as rare as a lottery win.
The closer you look at it, the more disappointing it feels.
In the boiling plates of its collar, there is still a fossilized skin.
Its right front foot is on its edge, five fingers upwards.
I can also count the basement of the foot.”
How one activist learns to answer the question: to whom the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home from St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment’s bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message to his classmate:
“The police killed just a 18-year-old boy and his body is still on the street.”
In a shame, she noticed that no one else had posted the same information on her feed. That's why she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In his time there were numerous re-interviews from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real-time about Michael Brown's death. The White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's immortal body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
“This is incredible,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, there was told that people were gathering to Canfield Driv.
Users posted pictures of police locks and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed himself to be Brown's father, who was on his side and read: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell watched a real-time video in which the police stood in front of the protesters with a hunting dog.
He also said he saw a video in which another police shot his stone and screamed, “I will take all of you... the animals.”
“This is not normal,” Ferrell remembers the statement.
“It was not such a murder that we are already accustomed to and which can be called a typical.
I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.”
He ordered his return home for the next day.
Ferrell went to seek his six-year-old daughter's father and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has been made in the documentary “Whose Streets?”.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and humility from the perspective of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson to the flower house and with his daughter dressed in a crown that is compatible with it, they went again into a discussion about “how it is to live as a black and under what conditions.”
“Do you remember when I told you how the black have been forced to fight for the things they believe in?” Ferrell remembers what she said to her daughter.
“We’re going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that’s not right.”
“I couldn’t be without taking my daughter with me,” Ferrell said later.
“The events of today are... the summit of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow up in it.
He has to get the abilities for activism and organization, but he has to also feel like the darkness of the experience of the different layers and circumstances of life. And he has to get to know what we have to do to liberate, to liberate ourselves.
Even though I’ve been able to protect her from racism, she’s still the same as the other black girls.
I feel that I will hurt him if I protect him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station. It became the camp of activists as they waited for information about the case processing and finally got to know that no charges against the police would be raised.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch in pockets and distributed it to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to approach activism in a new way.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” he tells. During his studies at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the Association of Minority Nursing Students. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in the black communities.
“I had no experience of organizing.
Sometimes it just happened.”
Several weeks later, Ferrell met in a evening demonstration with Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “willed simply tell” what was happening.
She asked, “Do you really want to tell us what’s going on, or do you want a story that you can use for good?”
The background of the doubt was the countless times when people appeared in the local community, generally white, who just wanted to benefit from its difficulties and humility.
“We’ve heard that those born and raised in Ferguson didn’t have a common voice,” Folayan said recently in an interview.
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism among prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The description group followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we’re talking,” Davis says.
“For me, the most important thing was how local people were presented in the movie because I was presented in the same way.”
According to Folayan, it was not intended to focus on Ferrell’s experiences, because it was intended to show that the people’s movement “is not a charismatic leader but a community.”
That’s why the document shows surprisingly private sides of Ferrell’s life, such as love and marriage.
“I felt quite naked,” Ferrell laughed when told how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
“But I realized that this work and the human description of the black requires a certain vulnerability.”
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story repeats and reinsists the role of the black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was created on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012.
“The leadership of the black queer women has kept the whole movement up,” says Ferrell. ”It’s because we’re constantly fighting on many fronts.
The black queer women have to survive everything.”
Folayan agrees: “The movement isined by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women.”
However, she emphasizes that Ferrell was not elected to the document “self-intentionally” because of her queer identity.
“He got the energy to move,” Folayan says.
“It’s not a coincidence that she was in the front line. Black queer women live in the scale of many things, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is transmitted from the white corner.”
Newspapers have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tight.
Ferrell has another two and a half years of conditional remaining. he was convicted of blocking the motorway in the protests.
His description of the social-political atmosphere of his hometown is short and core: “Sekasotku.”
Nevertheless, he continues to rely on the sculpture that he learned out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
The Artist Creates Pictures of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York is hanging in the middle of the exhibition room with white, black and brown faces, between which you can see the similarity when you look closer.
These 30 works are paintings made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's pocket and hair.
Manning sent samples from the prison in Fort Leavenworth, where he was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Manning was convicted of secretly leaving classified diplomatic electricity to the WikiLeaks site.
Dewey-Hagborg’s A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
The background of it is two years of letter exchange between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transnational and pioneering interdisciplinary, whose prison sentence Barack Obama relieved his term for the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA in an algorithmic way and created 30 images based on his genetic data. These are a sharp, though slightly theoretical point of view of the modificability of the DNA data, the multi-interpretability and the causal-season relationships under interpretations, as well as the identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified women since her childhood. She was found guilty in 2013 for 20 crimes, including spy law breach, computer hacking and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a rough, black-white selfie in which the troubled Manning sits in the car at the driver's place.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was behind the very popular Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
He received DNA data, for example, about smoking and smoking, and created images of what the people in question could have shown.
The artist received an email from the paper magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story,” Dewey-Hagborg told the new show at a news conference.
Manning was not allowed to visit and he could not be photographed in prison. So the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA photograph of Manning.
The artist and his arrested musician suddenly became letters exchangers. They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a series of Suppressed Images, depicted by Shoili Kanungo. It described a future in which the president would have relieved Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's sentence only a few days after the cartoon was published. It was a lucky coincidence after spending seven years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened just now that Donald Trump is taking his own war against cybercriminals and transgender soldiers and finds on Twitter more and more new ways to strengthen those powerful twistings he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has its purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery is the artist’s statement and under it the Manning’s great title, where the point of the birth name is the heart. In his opinion, the artist demands the end to “the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are founded.”
The opposite wall has a Manning DNA cycle: a long line of C, G, and A letters written on a slurry.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the artist’s scientific definition includes – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
“I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal to our genetic family and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
“DNA tells countless stories, here are 30 of them.”
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room: a page of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's cartoons.
In that, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
“If they get you calmed, they’ve won,” the picture says.
“Don’t ever silence.”
“The text is from the letter I got from Manning,” the artist from Philadelphia says.
“It’s so impressive that I still get cold colors.”
Unlike what was described in the cartoon, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes to the place, he is greeted by his own genetic faces as a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It’s intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA cycle is written with a lead to a height that is the same as his length (157,5 cm).
“The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people into them,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
“I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his liberation.”
Professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University are searched for murder suspect
The police said they started a royal search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford who is suspected to have been raped and killed in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook County court documents show that on Monday, arrest orders were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being treated several times.
According to a local report published by the police in Chicago, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building and found the victim with several crude wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the site of the incident and the shooting is being investigated as a murder.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at the Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Deputy Director for Social Relations at the University, said in a statement sent by email that Lathem is now in administrative freedom and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campus.
“This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University will help in the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
In a statement sent by a spokesman for the University and Somerville College, it is stated that “we have been in contact with the police in the UK and we are ready to help the U.S. authorities investigating the case in all possible ways.”
Moreover, the statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and hoped he would give up.
Chief Intelligence Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly urged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their location, and we are constantly investigating,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will help in the search of the suspects.
He told the police that he had received a phone call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an unprecedented clue that something had happened in the 1008 apartment.
Police described the appearance at the scene as terrible.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He told security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team published the following statement to the residents: “The police are currently investigating the course of the events and the background of the victim and the possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
A man threatens to explode the Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” the convicted told the police.
Moffatt must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to explode an Islamic bookstore in London and “to kill all Muslims.”
According to Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of harsh harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alerted them to the place on May 23.
According to officials, the man had "threatened to explode a bookstore and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police for a threat.
The threat was not associated with bookstores.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same house as the bookstore suspect, a police spokesman said.
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” Moffatt told the police in an interrogation.
As a punishment, the man must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds or approximately 690 euros of legal costs and 85 pounds or approximately 95 euros of compensation to the victims.
According to a spokesman for Scotland Yard, several hate crimes are not.
“We will take the WADA route action to an end in the near future,” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon terminate actions under the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA Charter to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA.
“Some of the measures under the scheme have already been implemented, and RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA’s roadmap has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which defines the conditions for the restoration of the powers of the RUSADA. The second part of the Roadmap was recently published on the organization's website.
It does not contain anything that concerns Russia.
“Everything has been announced, and everything is implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WAD in the near future,” Mutko added.
One of the points of the target, however, requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of the investigation of WADA’s, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the state’s alleged contribution to Russian sport doping.
Mutko said: “The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted a failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we can not admit what was not there.”
In the words of Mutko, it was all over the opinion of the chairman of the Russian independent public anti-doping committee, Vitaly Smirnov.
Earlier the same day, speaking to the Russian RSport sports media, Smirnov admitted that there were problems with the Russian anti-doping bodies. ”We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial views and regulations.
We will not accept the report unconditionally,” he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to terminate doping controls in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, it was authorized in June to plan and coordinate the testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA’s leader Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA’s headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he said the organization is “on the right path” towards the restoration of powers.
British organization skeptical to Finnish loving innovation: "There is no evidence" of the health benefits of maternity packaging
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian that the Lullaby Trust, an organization that fights deaths, has banned the use of their own records in maternity packages distributed in the UK.
The delivery of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, the packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity package would reduce the risk of concealed death.
A hidden death means an inexplicable child's sudden death.
Lullaby Trust is an expert at the UK health authorities in the field of child's safe sleep.
We will no longer allow to pack our official prospectus on them because it would allow you to understand that we recommend this product, the organization.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of a number of different reasons, including a small number of teens.
The fact that there is given a box to each family can be one factor.
This cannot be said with certainty, Lullaby Trust CEO Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and concealed deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given for all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of accessories, such as children’s clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the packaging.
The packaging itself is a bag where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, in turn, says there is no safety standard for bedrooms as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging may be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no floor or floor bed available.
The organization recommends to use the package only for daytime and stop using it at the time the child can turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and ensure that they don’t crush or dirty.
A crazy horse flew from a Japanese zoo
The Japanese Zoo staff is searching for a scattered horse.
The Jettiläskilpikonna has surprised the staff with its speed and has already fled to repeat in two weeks.
The kidney fled from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, Japan on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the ship was leaving the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn't die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried, said Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
The 35-year-old cow is female, 55 kilograms and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the carcass silent and gentle.
During the opening hours, the car is allowed to move freely in the area.
The zoo has not received sights from the shark.
The previous incident occurred in another week.
Yamane found a coward walking along the road 150 meters away from the zoo.
I saw it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Will Help Your Business Avoid Uber Errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her e-commerce startup company, but the queries did not work.
The answers were often insignificant, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the queries were anonymous, some of the employees attended them doubtfully.
“The queries were simply not consistent and objective,” Errett tells. As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
He decided to seek outer assistance.
More and more new types of HR management startups have come to the market, helping other companies find out how their employees can.
Companies can make surveys and target them to certain teams and population groups as well as provide their employees with anonymous notification services and in some cases direct contact with the top management through the government.
“You can track your own health with apps like Stravan and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit for companies?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years. She says she has got a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of her employees.
The program can make quick queries and votes for certain teams. In addition, it can create a map from which you can see from one glance, which departments employees are most dissatisfied and which of the leaders have received the weakest ratings. On this basis, Errett has been able to broke into the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber. The transportation company has been shrinking since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture in which employees are anxious and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such negligence is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation, and compliance are a global sector, the value of which, according to the Let’s Talk Payments website, may rise to more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, located in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent misuse. The interest in the company grew earlier this year as Uber's reputation experienced a collusion.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It has recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows to do customized queries, collect answers confidentially in real time, and map the problem areas.
In addition, employees can notify unfair behavior anonymously by text.
And if the manager has a reason to suspect uncertainty, the complaints go directly to the company’s government.
“The general opinion has dismissed the authorities,” says Convercent’s founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He reminds that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can become expensive even if the authorities do not interfere with it. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and become challenged by court.
The Ruby Tuesday food chain has more than 25,000 employees in 500 offices. The company has been using Convercentia for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the principles and procedures and are easily connected to the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if a worker wanted to notify the problem, he had to first find out the telephone number or email address with which he could make a notification to the headquarters. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
“It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” says Ruby Tuesday’s law director James Vitrano.
Previously, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and addressed faster.
“To provide a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
“We also protect our shareholders from legal proceedings related to employment relations.”
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employees’ commitment more seriously after the audit company Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of an unethical activity in the context of the Enron scandal.
Only through the social media companies understood that they could no longer prevent public investigation.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service that is regularly charged.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by capital investors. Both Glint and Convercent support capital investors.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million of funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital.
In November, Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and collected $60 million of funding.
Investments are not a surprise when taking into account the connections between companies, corporate culture and risk capital.
A number of studies show that employees expect more from their workplace.
On the competitive markets such as the Hidden Age, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to the company’s success if they enjoy the company and feel they’re listening to and their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, CEO of LinkedIn, responsible for rewarding and well-being employees.
Investors get profits when succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen employees’ commitment, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to workplace culture experts, the knowledge of the commitment of employees is important,
But it is useless if no measures are taken on its basis.
If a company requires feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employees’ commitment.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to go for four thousand discussions,” says Russell Raath, CEO of the business management consultancy company Kotter International, who has seen companies trust too much to simply gather information.
“If the company does not take measures, employees begin to wonder if they’ve got heard.
And their opinions matter.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys every month and is able to address the problem on the same day as it is in Glint.
When Errett had gathered feedback on decision-making slowness and communication quality from frustrated employees, she was able to make changes in the teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees more and more and hopes that deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term durability of the staff in the industry known for the great variability of employees.
“If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” Vitrano says.
“If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of lying his naked neighbor, the news agency tweeted.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of her house from the shower when she had noticed a cell phone hanging out of her window.
The woman said the camera was shot in the apartment.
A woman who was scared of the incident had run into another room to dress up.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but soon after that was counted into the window again.
A 20-year-old suspect has admitted that he has photographed a woman.
He said he had only seen a woman’s face.
The video was deleted and the police did not return it as evidence.
During the hearing, the man has admitted the offence, but has refused to commit a crime.
The man was justified by saying that he loves his neighbor "very crazy".
According to the news agency, the man is charged with the case.
Teachers are calling for more in the autumn talks
The salary development cannot be lower than for example in the export industry, but the difference should be reduced, OAJ’s chairman Olli Luukkainen said Thursday.
The temporary cutting of public vacation funds emphasizes the difference, he notes.
We do not have the possibility to conclude such contracts in which the review in any way would not involve vacation funds.
Contracts in the municipal sector will only be concluded when the papers of the private sector are signed and the elevation rates are clear.
For instance, it is estimated that the terms and conditions of the OAJ work have been agreed in January.
The percentage target has not yet been revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the Jukos Public Education Negotiating Organization.
Previous Post:French Fees Increases Profit Differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of the public sector will decrease, while the private sector’s purchasing power will grow.
According to Lukkainen, a periodic vacation fund reduction further boosts the income development differences.
In Finland, the number of students per teacher can be determined.
In addition, the OAJ points out that the equality of basic education must be guaranteed, as the differences between the best and the weakest are increasing.
According to the organization, learning results are decreasing, and the differences between both students and regions are increasing continuously.
The Bruins Players Day lasted as the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
A group of U.S. football players at UCLA have left to talk about the other stage of the campus’s new training fields.
Their backs shine from the hair after the first day of the workout camp.
For many of them, this a few-minute conversation is a midday break.
Players studying at the University's summer courses return to the residence after three hours of exercises to read the final tests. The next morning they meet half seven to the Wasserman Football Center.
“The next three days will be hard for these guys,” says Bruce’s coach Jim Mora a little before Monday’s shift to Tuesday.
The university sports roof organization reduced the number of daily exercises from two to one. The change was intended to relieve the workload of the players, but it has been extended to their days – at least until Friday, when the last final tests will be held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three exercises began at over seven in the evening.
The camp began this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood training period lasting through the Moran six, when the exercises are held at the same time with the summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening season begins: UCLA will face the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she’s supporting the NCAA’s regulation change, although it made the players’ schedules even more strict.
“We’re loading them really a lot for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora says.
“But the players are ready to do work, they’re great friends.
I think the situation will be easier when we get to Saturday. then we have more time.
It’s not easy to take into account the direct view from the exercise fields to the nearby parking area and to the Lusky Center, a high-level hotel that has already been bombed over the protective network behind the paintball with flying football.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora acknowledges that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to the outside.
“We have security arrangements,” Mora says.
“The disadvantage is that people can book a room and photograph exercises from there to the video.
The video of the exercises is paid a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We do our best.
I am not going to trouble my head too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
In Central Africa, Rwanda, presidential elections will be held on Friday, the winner of which is already clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking his third season, but in practice he has influenced the country’s leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebellion group RPF ended the extremist-organized genocide.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for destroying the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He is also accused of corruption in poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to pursue an effort as the two-season presidential constitution was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuine leader.
In his time, social reforms have been undertaken in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
Furthermore, Kagamella has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to wonder whether a liberal multilateral democracy is the right model for African states.
However, both have promised more freedom to their people after the land has been lifted up on their feet.
It could be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting fake news by enhancing facts checking
Facebook plans to send possible false news to increasingly independent facts inspectors and to present the results below the original article. The world’s largest social network announced this Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will begin to use updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to facts inspectors and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the largest distributor of fake news. Many believe that fake news influenced the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has emerged into a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed by fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports a plan to punish social media networks if they do not remove hostile content urgently.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the facts are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see what stories do not pass through the seat of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so they can decide more intelligently what they read and share,” Facebook’s news service product manager Sara Su wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the topic-related articles function and will make other changes to its news stream to reduce false news.
The Story of a Castle: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in the Kent County is now known for the Squeez music video and Margaret Thatcher's refuge from the 1970s and 1980s.
Now this charming place, located in the Bewlin River Valley, is the subject of a cartoon written by Jamie Rhodes, a moppy hair writer who loves ancient documents.
“I think it’s great to be able to explore the text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago,” Rhodes says.
“I feel a personal connection when I keep the letter in my hand.”
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of the families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edvard Times. Each story is depicted by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first archive book. In 2014 he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration was from the British National Library's documents.
“I moved to tears when I noticed in the letter of the fingerprint. the letter was written by a double agent who worked for divisions in the 17th century,” says Rhodes.
That was his fingerprint.
And the letters smell the smoke, because at that time the fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love the archives.”
A writer attracted to the old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent days exploring the Victoria’s “new” castle, archives, treasures, and rare things, such as hanging hints on the walls and bottles that have been in the valley for centuries.
He walked around the old castle with ruins and forests and talked with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes also book-imaginating artists.
In the evening, he took whisky and began to write.
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of his last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation staff was just starting the archive passing. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years with the same method: bringing all the extra to the outlet.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the times of the English Empire, and maps of who owned anything. ”You could imagine that the landmakers are boring,” Rhodes says. ”Here, however, the families fought for even one cage.
I thought it would be allowed to be already.”
Some of the book's stories move from the castle to the English history, such as The Labourer. It tells about a man who soon after the castle was completed, connects to the English farmers' captain in 1381.
“The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex says that there was a break in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes says.
"The England's farmers' cabin began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could begin with a milestone.
Maybe these events are connected to each other?”
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, a story of a priest hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English religious purification.
The Smuggler again tells the story of the narrator Arthur Darrell from the 17th century. he is said to have scored his own funerals by filling a bar with stones (it was noticed years later when his tomb was opened).
Darrels are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. ”The men of the family seemed to have been fairly knights. They were constantly borrowed and bought things they’t have been able to afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problem by getting married to wealthy old women. I see them as beautiful guys who knew how to lie the heirs.”
Now Rhodes is seeking new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a cartoon about Life, a healing at the beginning of the twentieth century, of which only a refined plot remains.
Scotney's Castle has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave there,” he says.
“I’t have wanted to go back to this evil day.”
Russia is the worst country since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think I can say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now harder than it has ever been after the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern territory of Ukraine, NATO relations with Russia have deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not get to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can go to a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the aggravation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump was able to point out that the U.S.-Russia gap was even at a dangerous low level.
Trump urged to thank the country’s poor intersection Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko stops re-match against Anthony Joshua
The long-term professional competition heavy series world champion Vladimir Klitschko ends his career.
Ukrainian President Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Klitschko played as a professional 69 times and won 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles in the years 2000-02 and 2006-15.
He lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury hit him in the point in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko met Anthony Joshuan at Wembley Stadium and lost after a striking match in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko are expected to meet in a new match in Las Vegas in November.
He did not find motivation for the match.
I intentionally used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional professional, I’ve achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I would never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful betting career.
I am very grateful for it.
Take a look at Klitschko's reasons for his decision in the video.
The manager of Klitschko, Bernd Bönte, said in a statement that the termination decision was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always emphasized that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has joined the American actress Hayden Panetter since 2009.
The couple have one child, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitschko's grandfather Vitali is also the former world champion.
During the 2008-12 years, the brothers dominated the World Cups of different federations at the same time.
The Finnish meteorologist clashes on the circumstances: "Vie fiilista"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer outer season.
Nick has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold are taken from the woman from the fiil.
At the World Cup in London, there are unstable conditions.
Nicaragua is talking about the weather.
The circumstances have been this week a backbone against Minna Nika.
I’t want to blame the rail, but it was uncomprehensible that I didn’t get even a small seed to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I’ve been competing and exercising here know how many times and I’ve never experienced the same variable wind in this place, Nikkanen said at Paavo Nurmin Games.
In this season, standing the jump has been really difficult, as there have been so unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in Kaleva's matches.
The weather spoke on Thursday in London.
It’s quite challenging to get the technology out – whether it’s a cooling or what.
It has been cold and wind, and it has come out of the fiil.
There is no reason to consume energy in bad conditions.
He reached the World Cup with his 455 shots.
It was 445.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
We have to wait and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to overcome Friday in the 460.
Why do you train abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was from the beginning in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump to the back and the technology standardized.
You should have done the same now.
The hall was normally closed, and the hall was closed.
How would it be to play?
25 degrees of heat.
It will be a little wind as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-officer silenced politicians in Ylli: "We have no distribution right now or for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipila must keep the ice in the hat and be warned of the expansion of the state budget with the debt funds, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets for decades in the Ministry of Finance.
He says there is no distribution.
He interviewed the retired Virt in 2015 on Wednesday.
The government’s budget for the next year is just starting.
Recently, there have been a blurred proposals by politicians, such as raising the guarantee pension, calculating the car tax and supporting electric bicycles, Virtanen considers as electoral speeches.
They mostly say that the elections are starting to be near, because when ten percent of the state budget is funded by additional debt, we have no distribution right now or for many years.
I think it’s even a fraud to talk about the dividend when the debt is taken, Virtanen said to Yl.
He added that all the debt is due to children.
Virtasella has a long experience in the preparation of the state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as a budget director and then worked as a deputy chief and budget manager of the budget department.
Last before retirement, he served as the council chief of the Ministry of Labour and Commerce.
Virtanen noted in an interview with Yle that the current 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All the predictors estimate that this is a pivot from which we are going to go to the bottom in the next year, and Finland is expected to increase by one percent for decades.
Washington changes rules for permanent residence permits
President Donald Trump told the media that the rules for the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, strengthen the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current program.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to sustain themselves and have the skills that are beneficial to our economy,” Trump said.
The Danish Queen's husband doesn't want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
The picture of Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
The Queen of Denmark, Margareeta, 77, and her husband, Prince Henry, 83, are not buried together.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The royal room has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde court church, the door said in a statement on Thursday.
According to the BT newspaper, the reason for this is the Prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is not a secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the chief communication officer Lene Belleby commented in the newspaper.
The prince's decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with her husband.
According to Hovin, the queen has long been aware of the desire for her husband to enter the tomb and understand the decision.

Tommi says his family survived a miraculous car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his brother, Riina, and the couple’s two young children were driving on the motorway near the Keimolanport in the direction of Vanta Hämeenlinnan.
From Frame III’s joining the Hämeenlinnan road, a white car runs along the acceleration circuit, which was driving the family’s car side, Tommi tells.
Without it, the car would have come to Tom.
I rushed and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of hand, Tommi tells me.
The family’s car crashed with a heavy speed.
The parents and two young children were not injured.
One of the children is less than 3 years old, and the other is less than a year old.
It was a good time when we didn’t get anything.
None of the guides did not even drive us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred around 17:20.
Tomm said no one stopped with them, and the family called the emergency center.
They were able to get out of the car with their own strength.
The ambulance and rescue staff arrived and the family’s condition was checked.
The car went to the rescue.
Tommi tells him and his spouse about the small income, and they received a family aid for the purchase of a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of the other car, the family does not receive money from the insurance.
That’s why the family hopes to see the sights of the car, which causes the family to drive into the shelter.
We need a car every day.
It’s hard to take the kids to the hole and go to work without it, says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
According to him, the beginning of the car registration number was SIG.
If the guilty is not arrested, I don't know how we're going to do it financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who see or know something about the incident will be contacted by the police.
The East New Zealand Police and the Central New Zealand Rescue Agency confirmed that they had been charged on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
Title and case corrected at 21.15: Unlike the story was originally said, the other car did not come to the line of the respondents, according to Tomm, but was driving from the accelerator to the family car side.
The show directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with human relationships by means of humor - The Self-Developer will be seen in What?-theater on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who comes from Kouvol, brings his primary leadership to What? theatre.
The self-discoverer is a musical theatre show of wrong past human relationships and insufficiency.
According to the director, it remains a good mind.
This is done by means of humor.
There is no sense of aging, he says.
The circular summer theatre proposal has been carried out with a small country budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation challenges you to think about what a person will reveal of himself when he met a new person.
Could he take a role or approach the other to open the jacket?
Untouchable show confuses fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the light.
The presentation consists of the text of the work group and does not contain any link.
The director believes that even though the show draws the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Self-Developer does not directly tell about his own or the working group’s human relationships.
Facts and fiction are mixed.
I’m sure I’m interested in my presentation.
I don’t think that human relationships would be bad, but I don’t think that human relationships, especially couples, would be a condition of happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Developer carries an up-to-date picture of young adults living in Finland at a hundred years old.
He says many have learned a lot about their relationships with their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need to stay in a bad relationship.
In the show are Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The work group also includes coatman Ella Snellman.
The music is mixed with the rock and the rock.
The love of the theatre burned in the shore.
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvol, studies theatre-expression as a director at the Academy of Arts of the Turun Professional School.
There are two years behind and a second mochoma in front.
The enthusiasm for the theater has begun during the years of Kouvolan.
The educator of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvolan Theatre and has performed, among other things, at the Ylioppilasteater in Helsinki and last at the City Theatre in Turussa.
The management has begun to be increasingly interested.
The self-discoverer received his first night last week in Helsinki at the Narr's stage.
The show lasts about 45 minutes and will also be seen at least in the Jäppisen study town in Market.
Self-disclaimer in the Kouvolan What?-theater 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a crash in a motorcycle crash
A few athletes in Finland have the same unstop natural power as Janne Lahtela.
He travelled the world hundreds of days a year for a couple of years and hunted his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream was realized in 2002, but the shift continued.
He was not only an untouched practitioner, but also an experimentator of new species.
There are no many forms of exercise on earth that the chemist would not have tried at least once.
He is excited to practice.
There’s always something new, she tells me.
Finally, one hobby was to stop the shell completely.
In 2014 he was in a motorcycle accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands broke.
I was not working anywhere.
I have wounds in my house for a year, says Lahtela.
She had bad luck.
He also acknowledges that his age could have been a part of the disaster.
Driving on the road may sound hard.
I did not seek the boundaries.
It’s just a kind of kind so hard that it’s not worth doing so much for such a thirteen!
After the accident, she was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long break behind as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
She started washing immediately after her career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be there.
I didn’t really do anything, she told me.
At the time of preparation, Lahtela is often challenged in its protected front and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my thoughts didn’t feel meaningful.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really liked it because I just got it once.
An obligatory break to become the main coach of Finland.
Unless he stopped, he was afraid he would have burned out.
It’s easier to find places that have gone away than cattle!
Without the accident, I’t have realized that I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela started as a coach of the Finnish freestyl team about a year ago.
At the same time, she found a safer hobby instead of babysitters.
I changed my motocross to frisbeegolfin.
It came out of the plate immediately.
In the worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Though Lahtela has always been a superstitious coach, he does not require his trained to be the same as him.
I don’t force everyone in the same form.
Our variety culture has the space to be its own and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been consistent with it, says Lahtela.
Sexrobots are coming and we should be worried
It’s here: a report on the technological developments in the sex robotics industry – just as it had begun to feel like the year 2017 can’t be more strange.
Yes just.
Sex robots are a big thing.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
“We need to get serious about the generalization of sex robots,” says founder and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence Noel Sharkey from the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nails and the type of fingerprints.
“Sex robots are being hacked, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we’ll see them more and more,” Sharkey said at the publication ceremony of the report.
Sex shoes have evolved from floating shoes to robots with a warm-sensitive silicone skin and artificial intelligence characteristics that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adjust the robot to his own preferences from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nails and to the type and color of the fingers.
More worrying is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford’s women look like advanced freedom fighters.
Sex shoes have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a RealBotix robot can be adjusted to the user’s preferences, for instance, as a slide.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-designed personality: Frigid Farrah affects the water, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user’s personality,” the company’s website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be either tired, tired, or “in the mood.”
They replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the submission of women and direct rape phantom when the user approaches, for example, a scam and counterprogrammed robot.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator:
“Women have a vibrator.Why should men not have a sex robot?”
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalization and development tells us about something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality to gender relationships, where submission is one option among others.
Most men, of course, did not get sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, although FRR’s report their growing favour.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people begin to behave strange or offensive only after the market gives it permission.
It’s not a coincidence that sex robots have begun to spread at the same time that women’s rights are threatened around the world and a president sitting in the White House has called for women who are worried.
The TV series The Handmaid’s Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most concerned about its powerful image language, such as images of drawn bodies and drawn out of eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the series world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but just now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robotics are attempted to make as many real women (in the proportions of porn stars) as technically possible.
The developers of robots want their skin to feel genuine and movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
A robot can’t get out of a relationship or situation.
They don’t have their own will or history – nothing that refer to independence or the imagination of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
The slave.
Police suspect two terror attacks were planned in Australia, group led by ISIS chief
The head of the ISIS group led a group of Australian men who are suspected to plan to carry a bomb into the Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of the Islamic State had also sent bombing parts to Sydney.
The suspect said the bomb was intended to be brought to the aircraft on 15 July, but the company stopped before security inspections.
The police don’t know exactly why the company stopped.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build an uncolored toxic gas detoxifying device and bring the device to a precise public place, for example, in public transport.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that has ever been made in Australia.
Four of the suspects were arrested on Saturday after a police session.
One man has been released, but his interrogations are also ongoing.
The good side of Trump?
Let Mitt Romney show the heritage of a healthy reason
During the Trump season, it has been repeated until it is tired that the strong two-time voter division has everyday disintegrated families as well.
On the occasion of Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers’ consultation guidelines showed how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to burn our information flame.
Trump’s ability to unite families is less observed.
I'm telling you about this because my grandmother's neighbor came to me this week in New York. He's a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago, who has long been knitting against our relatives with the Republicans.
He reminded that a common enemy can have a strong binding effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my sister’s all acquaintances – including a Republican-protected sister with whom he has been disputing politics for decades – are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
It’s a good thing on the dinner table, but in a wider sense, it is associated with significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we talk about the scary possibility that one day we will no longer be able to scare his tricks.
In the long run, there is even more embarrassing the possibility that Trump normalizes the right extremist Republicans, which suddenly seem to be quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I remind myself of Mitt Romney’s humiliated version of madness: a dog on the car roof, a 14 percent income tax (and his tax statement we’ve yet seen).
When Trump’s season is over, the Republicans’ next presidential candidate needs to be clear, and it feels an immediate significant improvement.
When my grandmother was going to me, we took our children to the Central Park carousel. It's the largest carousel in the New York Park department and the best thing in New York to get for three dollars without caffeine.
Karusell's horses are enormous, the characters in the middle — the clowns and the animals looking back in the horror — are evil, and the background of the competing music is strange and fascinating.
Many of New York's character circles get disappointed over time: the views of the high buildings begin to get tired, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not match dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not fully overcome that the Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss house, but a big transport hub in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it is not counted.
Instead, the carousel of the Central Park remains a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two-year-old, one eleven-year-old and two-quarters women enjoy it enormously.
I would give karusell full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, this week, I was asked to evaluate my “payment experience” at a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in the coffee shop at my home, but there I also get the opportunity to combine the estimate of 15 percent of the service money when I go myself seeking coffee from the press.
This will slow down the interaction and pressure the customer service to put his person into the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The store vendor smiled as a regrettable feeling when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi has been dismissed from Inter - "There was no leadership confidence"
FC Inter has released Shefki Kuq from the post as a coach.
The manufacturing responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously served as assistant coach.
The other training group continues to carry out its current tasks.
Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach, among other things in the English Sunderland.
Piccareta, 51, who joined the Inter training group in January, passed the UEFA Pro license last year.
FC Inter’s chairman Stefan Håkans regrets the incident.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
Shefki Kuq, however, no longer had confidence in the leadership of the group, when there was no other option now, Håkans commented in the group's statement.
The Piccat Treaty is in force until the end of the period.
He, together with the other coaches, will be responsible for the home match against HIFK tomorrow.
According to the news, the team has been struggling on Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the team’s assistant coach Piccareta and John Allen have been removed.
Kuqi and Piccareta took strongly together in the Inter match against PS Chemistry last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture of the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violin artist Linda Lampenius posted a youth picture on Instagram.
The image has been added to a number of screams, based on which it can be concluded that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself is also wondering a young woman watching a serious camera.
Long ago, seriously, he communicated.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
Just a year ago, she posted a picture of herself on Instagram.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, in the second he pose now, as the mother of two children.
In his picture text, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a man and refers to the eating disorders he suffered when he was younger.
20 years ago and today.
I still look much the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to take care of myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text she had added the English hashtags of life, eating disorders, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is clean.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
She was hospitalized at the age of 14 for anorexia and anorexia.
A little later he also became sick with bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
Healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius sent from prison to hospital for breast pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized in the cramps in his shoulder, which he received after he fell in a cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder by the prosecutors for the original murder sentence.
He was killed in the early hours of Steenkamp's Friendship Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night penetrator hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius's six-year sentence too mild.
The prosecutor plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint is likely to be addressed this year.
If the complaint is approved, the sentence of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country’s foreign ministry by bTV.
The police arrested a group of people who had been camped in Sithonia on August 1st morning, with two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the rules on free camping areas and already impose considerable fines to all those who are camping elsewhere than those reserved for the purpose.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
The share of liquid drops - already dropped -7.7%
Oil distributor Nesteen’s share has dropped by 7.7 percent around 11 p.m.
Its earnings before the taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast collected by Inquiry Financial.
Today, the stock exchange has gone to a mild turn on its side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
After the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index dropped by 0.2 percent.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange, OMXH, had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points about a half hour after trading, and the most exchanged companies, OMXH25, had dropped by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of the stock exchange was 41 million euros, of which nine million were the morning result publisher Nest.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritated intestinal syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may relieve irritated intestinal syndrome.
Damaged intestinal syndrome is an unhealing disease that suffers about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or blood diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein contained in the essential amino acid tryptophan helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to the study’s director, Marco Colon, the immune cells protect the mouth and ensure that no harmful microbes are hidden in the food to enter the body.
The inflammatory cells are balanced by the cells that strengthen their tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result can be irritated intestinal syndrome.
The tests found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance were found in mice with a particular bacterium in the intestine.
This bacteria needs tryptofan in order for immune cells to begin to appear.Tryptofan is one of the protein building substances.
“We had a link between the Lactobacillus reuter and the development of tolerance cells. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal intestinal microbiomy,” says Professor Colonna.
“The more triptophan was in the mouse diet, the more they had such immune cells.”
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuter bacteria and a diet rich in tryptofan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
During the study of immunosupporting cells, the researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not in the same species of mice that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was associated with the microbioms of the mouse intestine, i.e. the normal digestive community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the DNA of the mouse intestine was examined, six bacterial species were detected in the mice that had immune cells, but not in other mice.
When the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria was administered to mice growing in a sterile environment with no intestinal microbioma and with no immune cells developed, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They cultivated Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in a liquid and transmitted small amounts of fluids – without bacteria – from mice to isolated into impotent immune cells.
The immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen their tolerance.
When the active ingredient was cleansed from the liquid, it turned out to be a subproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the number of tolerant cells increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is still unknown whether the biproducts of tryptofan from the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria will cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as the mice. However, in patients with deteriorated intestinal syndrome, genetic errors related to tryptofan have been detected.
“We want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the intestinal surfaces,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
“High levels of tryptophan in combination with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their prevalence.”
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United got a “good” deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a “good” match after an agreement with Nemanja Matic. The midfield player debuted in Manchester United's league in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for 40 million pounds, started with 2–1 victory in Dublin, United’s last round before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He influenced as a defense midfield player against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best condition yet because he was not involved in the blue-covered Asian tour before the start of the season. He managed in the field for only 45 minutes – this is a change that Mourinho says to come before the start of the season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him nervous – he has a natural football thinking ability,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him to be prepared earlier than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to cool his start-up for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the team has already done “excellent work” by acquiring three of the four players he’s set for priority.
“Three of the four – we need to give thanks to the accompanying,” he added.
“I’m more happy if I get all four, but they did a great job.”
Airballers strike Germany for two times
The Finnish women's airball team lost its fourth match in the World Cup to Germany directly by 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The level of German routine in playing is high.
The balance of their game was in every sector, Finnish chief coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two stages, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third stages Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
“When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to go along,” Kangasniemi said.
The most effective was 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Three of the four matches lost to Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Great Joint Committee has already sent challenges to Trump Jr. in connection with the meeting with Russia
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges with regard to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s summit has already sent challenges to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-known Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The news agency Reuters also confirms the news that the Wall Street Journal revealed earlier Thursday on the invitation of a large Jihad team to meet.
According to Reuters, a large delegation has sent challenges related to Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-known Waterman's meeting, which took place during the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
There were also the campaign leader of Donald Trump Sr. Paul Manafort and his team, White House’s current adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has invited a large jury crew to meet in Washington, means the Russian investigation has intensified.
The sources add that Mueller wanted to help a large Jihad team to investigate Russia’s interference with the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his close co-operation in the matter with Russia.
The great jury expands Mueller’s rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify voluntarily.
A large group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The large jury shall investigate the evidence that the prosecutor will find out during the investigation and decide whether the case should be prosecuted.
A British inventor microsurred himself to get home and in his car with a hand shake
The British inventor is the first in the whole country to microscreen himself so that he can open his house outdoors, get into his office, and start his car with a hand-shutdown.
Mikrosiru is between a 33-year-old Steven Northam's headquarters and front-end. Now he offers service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam's BioTeq company.
Northam works with the consulting sleeper Geoff Watson at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microwave installation meets the medical requirements.
The microwave uses the same technique as the microwave for cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microwave. The processing of one lock costs £300.
Northam is married and has one child. She has installed microwave technology both in her home and in her BMW Z4 car, which starts when she falls her hand on the control wheel.
The White House exhibition object cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's last decision to fly a marine helicopter to the southern coast of the White House for an event presenting American production was to pay the taxpayers $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is named Marine One when the president is in its shelter. It was a take-off at the event held in the White House on July 17, 2017, presenting American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials met the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a ship from Main, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested the helicopter to be placed with a mission order only about 36 hours before it landed in the southern coast for a “extraordinary” event.
“I just wanted to make sure you’re aware of this because it’s an extraordinary event that gets a lot of visibility,” HMX-1 commander wrote in an email on the day before the event to his commander, who is the assistant commander of the Navy Air Force.
In the message it was said that the helicopter would arrive in the southern suburb at 17.7.7 a.m. and the event would start at three a.m. The helicopter would leave the site only after the suburb was empty in the evening between 6 and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter’s departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed due to service time limitations.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident, and the unit's security personnel were next to the helicopter when it was in the land.
The documents received by the TIME newspaper don’t know if another crew was needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 was investigating whether the incident violated the law.
“One of our questions was whether this Hatch Act was violated. we were told that it was not violated,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate,” the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the White House’s official event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke in favour of the health reform that was being discussed by the Senate at the time, as well as a slower state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their trips.
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the background of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states,” said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crew of the HMX-1 unit regularly performs training flights in the Washington region and exercises on the southern square to bring the president to the White House with a precision of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings to the White House.
One official said the flights for the Made in America event belonged to the crew’s monthly training quota.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 hours on that day in “non-presidential support tasks.”
According to the White House, the event did not result in any other costs for taxpayers.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter show in the southern coast of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounting of flights related to the president's duties, and the accurate assessment of the event costs is difficult.
According to the Ministry of Defense’s 2017 hour remuneration, the remuneration rate for the VH-3D helicopter is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to documents from the HMX-1 unit, the flights from the Quantico base from Virginia to the White House and back take a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of the helicopter is clearly lower.
“It is misleading to calculate the cost to payers according to the compensation level,” says Walters.
“The estimated compensation level includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called inbound costs that are taken into account in the annual funds.”
According to a 2015 survey by the RAND research company, the compensation levels do not include staff costs but take into account fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter during the event.
“The idea is to present American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and will employ hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defence equipment for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is perfectly appropriate to point out.”
It’s not sure if Trump was going on a helicopter during the incident, but at least he shot the fire car to the driver’s place.
In the White House, Trump laughed with the press on his own Sikorsky ship.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three.”

Venezuelan prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative
Venezuelan prosecutor has requested a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the representative elected on Sunday will be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative was selected for the country, which could, among other things, amend the country’s constitution.
Prosecutor-general Luisa Ortega said the blocking decision was requested due to suspicions.
Ortega has also launched an election survey on the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company organizing a referendum said the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters by the Venezuelan authorities was about a million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the representative, and the 545-member representative list included Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the representative can dismantle the opposition-led congress and amend the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro’s actions are widely condemned.
The opposition considers the constitutional amendment of Maduro as a means to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, on their own, have announced that they will not recognize a new delegation.
Maduro says the new representation is a solution to the country’s political and economic crisis.
The tensions in Venezuela have lasted for months.
Many people were injured and more than a hundred were killed.
Venezuela has fallen into the economic crisis after oil prices have dropped.
Nowadays, many people do not afford food or medications.
The opposition is expected to express its opinion on Friday, when a new representation is scheduled to begin.
Russian man sentenced to four years in prison in the United States
The court in Minnesota on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senahi to four years in prison for participation in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US claim.
The Russian newspaper Fontanka that Senah had been on a vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland delivered the Senah to the U.S. law enforcement in February 2016 despite the Russian objections, the news agency AFP.
He was found guilty of a computer attack in March of this year, which had earned millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after he was sentenced to prison.
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly denied Finland after the arrest and said the man should not be delivered to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were complained that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing about it in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which was infected with dozens of inches of computers around the world.
The virus used usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the information to further control the internet traffic, which helped make click fraud and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, the head of the Department of Criminal Affairs, the case shows that the United States is also able to pursue other cybercriminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 8:58 p.m.: Repaired the name of the convicted person.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on women’s political role
The elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, can vote, the head of the UN Embassy in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the temporary head of the United Nations Assistant Embassy, said there are hundreds of women candidates for provincial councils, three women seek vice-president and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be highlighted too much,” Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
The elections can be truly representative and credible only if women are fully involved in them and they are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has threatened elections at the same time as the international forces are moving into a advisory role.
This year’s elections are the first time that the power moves peacefully from a democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women’s contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent election committee in Afghanistan, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

The flood of certain tourists threatens the region's culture
The authorities are considering to limit the number of tourists in Venice.
The local anger is focused especially on the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Ministry of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours and the big masses are wrapped through the sights.
Venice is suppressed by urgent day-to-day trips for tourists in the city.
The gate streets are difficult to move and the beautiful squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer get together.
They are forced to move more and more away from the historic centre while hotels have become the place of their homes.
The issue of tourism imports in Venice is written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon a low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, the time is given for two or three hours.
You will follow the flagship guide from Piazzale to Rome to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Tower, and turn back, describes Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschi's prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the site, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Tower is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the historic centre of Venice.
On the bridge of Tor is the church of St. Mark.
It is also mainly concerned with cruise ships.
In the historic centre of Venice there are only 50,000 locals.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, approximately 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has deteriorated their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
Approximately 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe, says Carlo Belframe.
Equality is difficult because ships bring to Venice the hardly needed income and create the need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to the limitation of the number of tourists, the solution is planned that the crossroads go further from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would change if the administrative area of Venice, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide on its own affairs - unless full autonomy.
Every year about 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice.

Destroyed kilometers on the motorway
On the motorway between Kupio and Silinjärve, on the line that goes north, there have been kilometres of work on Thursday afternoon during the return traffic.
The area is carrying out the coverage work of the motorways, which slows traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For information, there is a speed limit of 50 km/h instead of a normal 120 km/h speed.
In the 50 km limit area, the traffic had progressed on Thursday afternoon, however, practically walking speed.
On Thursday afternoon, the flights went on the side of the Silen Lake to the Apocalypse Path, that is, to the golden hole.
I’m going to work well without such attention.
A 23-year-old player has been told to see the public’s screams.
Amalie Iuel has published amazing pictures of herself, among other things, in the Grand Canyon landscape.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen as a popular athlete in his present home country in Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-meter race in March by rotating at the racing time of 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 meters speed at the Norwegian record at 55.38.
Iuel, who used social media hardly, soon after recording, noticed that fame and publicity had their shadows.
Men around the world began to send images of their genital organs to Iuel apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of "dirty pictures" from unknown people, so I was forced to convert my account to a private, Iuel told the VG newspaper.
Iuel didn’t want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he got in the VG interview.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It’s nice to get feedback after running, but I’m going to do well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, and his father is a Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved first to Namibia, then to Pakistan because of her father’s work.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were on their turn.
Iuel spent four years as an athlete at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel exercises under the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discuss than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask anything but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally deal with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 meters and 400 meters.
Footvamma brought snowballer Janne Korve to the forefront of his entire career - now participating in the World Cup: "Beautiful when it doesn't happen anything"
It was nice to count when nothing happened.
Janne Korpi, 31, who is one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has been able to truly enjoy its beloved species this season.
Last summer, the career continued.
The foot pressure disorder had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the foot didn’t want any healing.
The hand had taken a hit in the square.
In the summer, I didn’t know what I’d do, whether I’d go on or not.
Sponsors were broken and many things open, Korpi says.
But that’s how things are going to be arranged.
The foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull again to the edge.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it once when I was on the snow.
I thought it was fun, yes, it’s fun again, we’re going to go through a couple more.
The corpi was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long downtime, just painless training has been a big thing.
There are only a few tournaments that have gone around.
It does not bother.
The competition has never been the main aspect of the basketball.
I’ve never counted for one race.
I think it’s frustrating to look for four years in one match, and then you’re in a fever for that week.
I can’t think like that, says Pope.
Today, Corpi will compete in the half-pipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual matches don’t keep him in the board, in a hard companion of the crawl he always burns.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the international ski competitions organized by the International Ski Association has grown over the past few years, although some of the skiers have chosen to hold the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important games, the visibility is great.
Of course, I think the appreciation always depends on what the circumstances and what the level in the games are.
Corpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish team of 12 people in Sierra Nevada.
The teams, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It’s nice to watch the younger friends.
I remember when I was at that point that everything was new and was so sick and excited about everything.
It also brings a new flow to itself, Corpi thinks.
I’m still going to go on some way, but otherwise not, there’s a lot of flow in my friends!
On the background of the basketball career, Janne Korpi has also built a different type of sports career.
The director's legend Pekka Korve's son is engaged in nutrition: the swimmer has his own nutrition for which he makes training programs.
When I’m on the road, I don’t want to be on the road any more.
But I look at every day at least the nutritional results and usually some outlets, Korpi says.
Nutrition and food preparation are a potential career plan, according to Korve, when the boarding course comes to an end in time.
I don’t mean to plan so far, but it’s at least a likely option.
I feel like I’m going to study it alongside this snowboard.
I’m trying to stay nervous in time and develop, in summer I’m going to run some outputs.
If it’s my future profession, then it’s not difficult to start when it’s already finished within the species.
It also includes the Elitloppet-raviristeil that is organized with the count Jaajo Linnonmaan.
The two have rented a cruise ship, which will go to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet food competition.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The crossroads went well to trade, and people were excited.
Now we are at the point that there will not be a bankruptcy.
A few months is still time, we hope that the ship will be filled, Korpi says excited.
Atendon’s treatment project to Kite has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new, 41-located caring house to be built in Kite.
A building of 1,700 square meters will be completed next summer on the other side of the neighborhood Healthcare Center.
The topic of the general wonder is where the customers are enough to the new care unit, since now many private housing houses in the Siu Sode are pulling into the client.
Anne Flink Attendolta, Regional Director of Nursing Services, commented that in the future, Kite will have a greater demand not only for options but also for improved services.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, the freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought last year from Kite private housing houses Kanervikkolan and Eerika.
The deal concerned the business, but the real estate is clearly a five-year rental agreement.
Flink says that Attend does not have an acute need to move operations out of these premises.
More on this topic today later.
GMB is concerned about McVitie’s Scotland factory continuing to operate
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie’s inventory manufacturers for its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to GMB’s Scottish branch, the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea cake and other products factory has more than 500 employees.
McVitie’s owned company Pladis its investment in the factory over five million pounds in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade unions representatives will “be sure to be the first” if the activities are changing.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company “to be worried that there is no funding for the modernization of production lines.”
GMB’s professional association, Drew Duffy, is very concerned that the factory manager does not get clear information about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
“Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has focused strongly on the local community and Glasgow’s metropolitan area. The factory is a major employee in the area of high unemployment and poor output.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and output, as well as Brexit, rising living costs and the continued reduction of production, Eastern Glasgow has a strong need for a successful McVitie’s production.”
According to a Pladis report, the factory manager had received the letter of the trade union only the previous day and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the continued interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
“We had regular meetings with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with our employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and uncertain companies, we are constantly evaluating all our operations and operations in order to maintain our competitiveness.”
According to the report, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the last years in the Tollcross factory, especially in its production lines and in improving its operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a manufacturing facility and we will be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we intend to make changes to the factory’s operations.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verrattiin
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's demand after paying £189 million transfer agreement. But was PSG warning Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfers. The previous record was less than half lower: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfers of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him more than £500,000 a week salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be angry about PSG’s actions and the way Neymar has left the club. a source close to Barcelona says that the club has been very careful about Neymar since he arrived in Santosi in 2013.
Did PSG’s chairman warn the football world of this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG’s best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they’re stumbling our players, we’ll become their opponents and we’ll get in touch with their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all members.
But if they scare our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona appears to be guilty of this: it expressed its interest in PSG’s midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may be good that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar.

Trump's calls were invented - White House spokesman: "I't say it was a lie"
The White House acknowledges that the two calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump have never occurred, the New York Times reports.
Trump’s smoked calls with both the Mexican president and the party leader have proved to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had occurred.
He said Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the party leaders talked to Trump personally, and Trump had talked with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I’t say that it was a lie, it’s a hard accusation.
Those conversations took place, they did not only take place on the phone, but on the face, Sanders justified.
Parliamentary speech raised anger.
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and the pride of Trump in the successful fight against illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people will no longer cross the southern border of Mexico because they know the road will anyway reach the U.S. border.
The Mexican government on Wednesday issued a statement in which it said that the call has not occurred.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump spoke at a meeting of the National Party Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the party leader, he said that it was the greatest speech they’ve ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the party organization announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders’ calls to Trump.
According to the report, Michael Surbaugh’s previous statement, in which he had asked for Trump’s speech for forgiveness from the partians, speaks on his side.
Trump’s speech at the party meeting raised a lot of enthusiasm, as it was exceptional in terms of the nature of the event.
He also discussed the results of the last year’s presidential election.
