Members of the National Assembly for Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are puppets.
Several members of the National Assembly for Wales are dismayed that they have been suggested to change their titles, namely MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly for Wales present on the political scene fear that this would lead to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in the National Assembly for Wales is concerned that he is "sympathetic to the Twp and the Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means obtuz and pwp means fecal mother.
A member of the Welsh National Assembly for Wales said that overall the group was not happy and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member claimed that the group had an open attitude towards the name change, but also noted that the MWP was similar to the Muppet.
In this context, the letter w is pronounced in Wales the same as the letter u in Yorkshire-speaking English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the change of name, stated: The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly be up to the members themselves.
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them wished to use the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the nomination of members of the National Assembly for Wales, the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or MPs, but the MPs' choice was the one with the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that members of the National Assembly for Wales have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could be a blow to Elin Jones, the chair of the steering committee, who is expected to submit the bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly shall have the final say as to their titling when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote on the name change referendum
On Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their views on changing the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held to settle a decades-old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country that has its own province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a fierce opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is only a compromise that will allow it to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Episcopal Church have stopped ringing because of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
"Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you found a bar and a church on every street corner", Adams said.
Today, there are no bars or churches.
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently these days", he said.
Bars no longer serve as the living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather.
And as for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that sooner or later the decline will be the same.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condos filled with people who would not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who will buy condos in these buildings will be white, he said,therefore, this will accelerate the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condos will become members of those churches.
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-Americans  St. Martin's Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, made up of white people, moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who were conducting religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an African-American congregation, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the hiring or promotion of African-American people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "Poor People's Clowns".
The expert who commissioned the carillon in July described it differently: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, an expert, also said that it was the world's first carillon played by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What's been heard from St. Martin's in the last few months has been a complicated story, which has included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, some by the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, composed of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese was seeking to pass the costs on to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency that the diocese has shown.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old kid trying to catch lobsters in California
Authorities said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was swimming trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved in with a group that helped him out of the water.
Hammel also stated that he initially thought the boy was glad to catch a lobster, but then realized that the scream M had bitten him!
He bit me!
The entire clavicle was torn, Hammel claimed he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I called out to everyone in the water and told them to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
No known species of shark responsible for the attack.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a threatened species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper torso.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury Retailer plans to strengthen its position in the UK beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing beauty racks in the style of a universal store with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not in proportion, larger beauty product ranges will be tested in 11 stores across the country and integrated into several stores next year if successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household products.
Representatives from Sainsbury's retailers said the number of cosmetics it offers will double to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands like L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its make-up product line, Boutique, which means that most of the products are aimed at vegan people, a demand that is increasing among young shoppers.
In addition, products from French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury's stores for testing purposes, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store mean supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's retailer, said the outlets will increasingly look like universal stores as the supermarket chains try to cope with the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has included both Argos outlet products in hundreds of stores and Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The supermarket's previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty department stores failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations stalled after a disagreement over how to share Boots' revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's retailers, said: "We've transformed the look of our beads with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to give you advice.
Our brands can be tailored to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary place to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11m contract
TV show "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an £11 million lifestyle contract with his company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company has been compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would be retiring.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the main character of the show Dragons Den, withdrawing at the last minute from their lifestyle services business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was furious when one of the most beloved TV personalities admitted on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allow her to dedicate herself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would be leaving Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source's statement: Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was just before the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the UK's best-selling star of this morning could cause the company millions of dollars in damage as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, and a possible further delay in launch.
It can also mark the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as CEO in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We don't want to comment on his business".
I was very hard, and then I fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider " unworthy of a president" and for having such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said that by imitating a voice from a news anchor.
I haven't made a step back.
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not observed a proper response from the United States to North Korea's previous disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted that the United States continued to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
Everything is going well with respect to North Korea, he said.
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: halting missile tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning US troops.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I did that instead of the 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok Island was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for international relief efforts.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation, Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed access to the premises.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute to the relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia endures constantly, it is unlikely that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not very common on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that improving Indonesia's precarious infrastructure be the focus of his election campaign and has carefully allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko is also facing persistent pressure from sectarian groups in Indonesia as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs roamed the streets, using matches, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the save and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 metres from the opposing team's gate, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a punch in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached over the shoulder, heading towards the upper right corner of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed through Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the gate.
"I just had to try to get in the perfect position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, I just took the ball further.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue team forward sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and ran to the halfway point of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move into the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into the carriage.
Hazard overtook the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and passing the player Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the National Disaster Agency, on Sunday morning.
More people were caught under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters), agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered in debris from the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to this subject to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I call on all the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who have heard or seen anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material using the onboard camera to contact us if they have any information essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a Birkenhead woman and was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed into the building.
He was shocked to learn what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few more hours before they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
In front of the scene, a woman came forward in tears.
Repeating all the time is so terrible!
At 2:00 p.m., two police dubs were in the perimeter and another one was outside.
A few police officers were standing on the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person with information is requested to send a direct message to the @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the most recent memorial to be affected by the altercation over the rewrite of history.
Removing it would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan descendants.
But Cromwell's Society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the present debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an exact representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But surely, the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who is part of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead after an artery was cut and covered in blood near a pig farm in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the Sunday edition of the Morning Post in southern China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
It appears that he came with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door of a nearby barn open.
He stated that in the compartment was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Medical examiners confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were covered in blood and nipples", the cousin, whose last name is Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras have seen Yuan enter the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, her body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor did his cousin.
A market representative told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and the authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a man in Wales was trapped in his tractor by a 300-pound pig until his wife came to scare and chase the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood taste can trigger such reactions.
It's just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve, he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rain in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing intensity as it moves toward colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of 85 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, Sunday morning at 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression zone has begun to form across the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north toward the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 centimeters in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture that will interact with the depression will generate heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Local, rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
The intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 to 8 cm per hour in certain areas, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to be between 5 and 10 cm in the southwest, particularly in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible due to rapid deterioration conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into tides and dust.
The approaching depressive zone will bring torrential rain to areas along the southern California coast.
Rainfall of almost 2 cm is possible, which could lead to minor waste streams and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona in the second half of Sunday and early Monday, before rain spreads further Monday evening and Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will spread to the so-called 'four corners' on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, the United States will see intense temperature changes as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are seen across the central United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures as high as 27 degrees in areas stretching from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the press release backed by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting their regular Friday programming for one last-minute news: an agreement between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford testified before the jury that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh harassed her while he was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in the playoffs or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he tried to climb an elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He sat staring down for a few minutes while people argued with him, and it was all live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling us the truth?
And it was said unto her, Thou art strong, but the women are so weak.
Flake said his office issued a statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast the vote live on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to review the charges against the nominee next week, which is being demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced, largely, by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's election was a significant one, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes they needed to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of political games on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing a political role in the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with his front-page photo, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson attacked his Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect their tariffs on each other was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of shooting the LSU player to death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released footage of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the encounter.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde deadly.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their diligence and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-1, 195-pound forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what worries me all the time", Wade said.
A volcano dropped a column of ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity erupted in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors multiple rumblings and vibrations.
The social media images showed thin layers of ash on the windows of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of the secession vote, rallying thousands of opposition protesters.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from the gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
The clashes intensified later, with police using their batons to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted 'We don't forget, we don't forgive' while union protesters chanted 'Long live Spain!'
14 people have received medical care for minor injuries during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region, which wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become independent, although turnout was low and those opposed to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, resulting in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hopes of gaining independence from Catalonia.
Last year I had some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry over the joy of being able to vote, but now we have nothing to do, he said.
Despite a vital but close victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independent Catalan parties tried to hold on this year, with many of the most prominent leaders either in self-exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
As a candidate for the European elections, this is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government, he said.
Several men have been arrested after they drove into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car broke into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and even the building.
It appears that at some point a bullet was used against the car.
Menga's strike helped the Livingston team win 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga 's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unanswered, with Steven Gerrard coming on as second-team winner in 18 games as Ibrox manager.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second replay.
Gerrard's side are without a win on their way to the Premier League this season and face the Hearts leaders, being eight points behind them next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is missing his chance against the dark visitors
Holt's team should have gone a long way before they signed, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to hit the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to hit wide after slipping in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for visitors at free throws.
And that was how the crucial gap came about.
Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston won an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to take care of Menga, who kicked and scored from the centre of the bow.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely undisturbed for the rest of the game.
This pattern of play continued into the second replay, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow gave a wide kick from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come into Livingston's pocket, but without success, and the two penalty requests - after Halkett kicked Glenn Middleton and after a penny - were not accepted.
Fenomenal game offered by Livingston
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their playing style and team have not changed at all since their return to the top, but the credit must be given to Holt for the way he has coached his team since taking over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they have performed well since being led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The scoreless passes failed, they only managed to get the opponents' gate free once, and this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
Everything was pink on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, intended to remedy relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division in regard to a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in a Childers Street accident in which the driver fled the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, bus routes are diverted and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a clash
Six prison officers were injured in a clash at a high-security prison for men, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a riot broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30, this is ongoing.
Specialised officers were brought in to handle the clash, involving eight inmates, isolated in one wing.
Officers were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: The assistance of the prison's specialised staff was requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend longer periods of time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the riot police officers were called to the prison to handle a very serious situation, with the staff being attacked with billiards balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded by Hurricane Rosa (drought zones can benefit from this)
A tropical depression rarely happens in Arizona, but it is quite likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday it will cause rainfall.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix announced in a Twitter post that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state at a distance of about 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action at a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with possible total quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain from Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas torrential rain will be beneficial as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least one severe drought, the second largest category, according to information on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will cause landslides in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still hurricane-force on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 135 miles per hour, is 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 19 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and therefore will diminish.
So, it's predicted to cause landslides in Mexico with a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, posing a high risk of flooding.
Torrent rainfall is expected to be between 8 and 10 cm from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and may reach as high as 25 cm, according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north into Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The main danger posed by Rosa or its remnants is extreme torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States, a representative of the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce flash floods, which will endanger people's lives, and bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides into mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday, at approximately 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old boy were arrested in the Radstock area last night, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The officers asked for the help of citizens who might have material on their mobile phone, namely to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the discontent and anger of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also stated that Kavanaugh faced the discontent and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that she sexually assaulted her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her claim.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day.
"A confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but, in a way, I'm running, he said.
For this reason, I have a positive opinion everywhere about the candidates I consider to be outstanding.
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to resist and obstruct.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, with the number rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu City on Friday, when waves of six meters high hit the beach at dusk, people being swept away by water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still watching their beach activities and did not immediately run, thus becoming victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a news conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami brought its cars, bushes, houses, hitting everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled wide at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos published by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and overturned bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the ripples continued to shake the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the energy emitted by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow gulf, probably intensified the tsunami, the official added.
Nugroho described the damage as extensive and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, along with the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely disrupted with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse".
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for not informing about the tsunami hitting Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the nearby street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the truth of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic items.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu for Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff at Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where employees are housed in makeshift shelters in the office yard, they passed devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: "They told me they saw many houses destroyed.
The situation is very serious.
Although aid groups have begun to start disaster relief efforts, some people have complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's another provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster", we can start international assistance, but nothing has been announced yet.
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, the friends and families of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously rescued from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue personnel rescued a woman who had been in ruins for two days, with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the national paragliding team coach, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other people among those held at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
Given my experience in the parapente field, I have my own emotional burden, he said.
Gendon told how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse was broadcast to the community of paragliding sportsmen, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors from Palu who attended the beach festival.
But right next to his messages was just a gray steak, not two blue steaks.
"I think that means the messages weren't transmitted", he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while powering an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who powers an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car had stolen an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his stage name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to Ye.
He made the change announcement on Twitter on Saturday: "The individual officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses the title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes on the air in place of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it for emotional reasons, the producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that the word also has a religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means tu, West said earlier this year, during the discussion of the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
Because I'm you, I'm new, it's about us.
It all started with Kanye, which means the one, and it all came to Ye, which is a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and the whole.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people.
He's one of several rappers who chose to change their stage name.
Sean Combs has had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former West associate, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with cratymate, sometimes without, as well as in capital letters.
The President of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the marketplace on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in AI, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and user who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government made announcements about AI, even though the US lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be the number one AI innovation leader by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are way behind the U.S. and we're looking for the next discovery about AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that puts sticks in the wheels of academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding college graduates to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
I think they should automatically offer visas to PhD students in AI, he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the US Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
Also, at this time, NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, no changes have been made to the United States legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum whether they want the country's name changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposes its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign raised doubts about the voting attendance, possibly not reaching the minimum 50% limit required for the referendum to be validated.
The question on the ballot will be: 'Do you agree to EU and NATO membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price that Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, must pay in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66% of eligible voters turned out to vote.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted in favour of a referendum on changing the name of Macedonia, which will allow it to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and pulled seats in front of tents raised by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the front up, not the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted with the name Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
I think the majority will be in favour of the name change, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of NATO and EU membership, Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that one outcome in favor of the name change would be to confirm our future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of eligible citizens will participate in the referendum, below the required number of participants.
According to another poll by Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they'd vote for change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since taking over last May.
Video: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City manages to pass the entire Brighton team defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the defence of Brighton and secure a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field early in the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defending players at Brighton, before reaching the free end of the field.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then overtook several opposing players on the edge of Brighton's team.
Then he passed left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero is having some leg problems", Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager, told reporters.
I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point.
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial lead for the Azureans in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero gained a deep pass on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he passed Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane drove the balloon a few times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it towards the gate.
The Azure attacker hit the balloon into the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55pm in the group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make a mess of the game against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a game-high lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies earned at least one unpredictable spot, with a 5-2 win over the national team on Friday night, but they are still trying to retain their first division title.
Even if we don't play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open Sunday's match, but according to sources, they are inclined to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be on the opening shot of Game 34, had a warm-up session Thursday and will pitch in normal condition this Sunday.
The Washington center fielder has an 18-7 record and a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation of the Supreme Court's decision in respect of Brett Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
All our efforts are at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, not candidacy, but actually candidacy, which is why I try so hard to support good candidates", he said.
Trump went on: "Look at this terrible, radical group of Democrats, look at what's happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by whatever means necessary, you can see their evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it to them.
He also said that the Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
And you can see that in the last four days, he said, describing Democrats as angry and evil, rude and lying.
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was heavily criticized by the public.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
- Here you go.
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different view.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated
It's no surprise that Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion to censor me.
After all, I'm just one of the Labour Party members in Parliament who was told they weren't welcome just because we expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, was treated similarly because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of censorship was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, about which neither Jeremy had any common views with previous leaders.
The Labour Party's statement for Friday's Nottingham East meeting said that we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the Friday evening GC meetings were like this.
Unfortunately, today many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a better, more gentle political environment has long been forgotten, if ever fulfilled.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things started to be this way when Jeremy became leader, when I noticed that some colleagues I had a common vision with about politics started to expect me to change my mindset and agree to some things I had previously disagreed with, including national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there's a wave of abuse on the de-social networks that demands my removal from the party, denouncing the centre-right politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues, because comments about me tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination shown by my colleagues who experience sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censorship or change of selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
A lot of people have been telling me for the last two years to put my head down, not be so vocal, and everything will be fine that way.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the Thatcher government's negligence proved to be the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who needed them most, as a local councillor or minister.
I never hid my political opinions, including in the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that they are not clear about my views on politics and aspects that I disagree with regarding the current leadership.
To the people who supported Friday's motion, I can only say that, as the country moves towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of expulsion or political opportunism will stop me from making decisions that I consider to be in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Labour Party for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the standings
Despite the fact that two late tries influenced the final result in some way, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win today's highly interactive match in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the standings, being the only team without any defeat out of the ten.
In the end, it all boiled down to their better defense, as well as their better use of the opportunities that came up, which helped the home team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We've been subjected to several tests during our matches so far and we continue to be unbeaten, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "The credit goes to Ayr, they took the chances more than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card from Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team while he was playing for the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unchanged try.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even halfway through the match, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose got off to a great start in the second replay, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the field with the plate, and from the start of the game Ayr unleashed himself through the try of player Stafford McDowall, turned by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an unchanged try by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for liking Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving Ayr an advantage.
Climo turned the try, as he did again near the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe performed a box kick move and sent extreme Gregor Henry into the depths for the host team's fifth try.
The star of the sitcom Still Game seems poised for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Ford Kiernan, star of the sitcom Still Game, seems poised to move into the hospitality industry after learning he's been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's beloved show, writing the script and starring alongside his longtime partner, comedian Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, number nine, would be the last, and it appears Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in the restaurant industry.
The sea is ours: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling a naval base full of squid in La Paz.
Public buildings carry the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
We have to get her back.
Along the sea-locked Bolivian coastline, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive  as is the desire to sail again into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has the necessary wealth, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, looks forward to the outcome with a positive vision, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and that after decades of hard-hitting discussions, Chile is forced to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia  who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year  also has much to gain from Monday's decision.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it did.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no power to grant territory belonging to Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that this case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has Bolivia not had success with the cause, but it's possible that the last four years have turned it back.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has weakened any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  one of Latin America's most beloved presidents  was using the maritime issue as a political support.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless the United States is trusted.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to honor its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri stated that it is unrealistic that the continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean War ever make the northern territory surrender.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the statement without the Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who don't believe that Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenian next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A Paris fashion show showcase the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you're looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their 2019 spring-summer collection.
The no-brainer hats took over the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers sent eye-stealing creations onto the podium.
The resistance piece of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant, beige hat with a wide, feather-like bore, into which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included pearly-decorated peppers, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and carried more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessory, rather than haute couture.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving gear, with an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt this style of clothing, with oversized clothing items, you're in luck.
Stylists predict a return of huge bonnets to luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come after the appearance of the La Bomba hat, the wide-brimmed straw hat, seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the no-brainer hat that appeared on all social networks led to the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely beach straw bags, of the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffle bag, with raffle fringes and a white leather handle, was the endurance piece of Jacquemus's 2019 spring-summer collection La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see oversized beach hats and bags in luxury stores next summer, because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills, essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results on examinations, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for secondary and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we see that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest rates of promotion in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, are held in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects in independent school curricula and other fields.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for reasons employer gave to the job vacancy fight, 17% were attributed to a language skills deficit.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you'll have a real advantage in the future, having that skill throughout your life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-figure percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in learning foreign languages is important for today's children.
With more languages, especially in developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be more languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It must be done .
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play remains to be determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
Time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in places where voters favor him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his chosen candidate for the vacant Supreme Court seat is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's election rally in West Virginia tonight, and where can I watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election rally in West Virginia online through the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this rally is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some ground.
So, those in President Trump's campaign said the role of these five rallies next week is to "energize volunteers and supporters", while the Republicans try to protect and expand their holdings in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the busy campaign season", a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won the election by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out the Republican candidate for Senate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is running in the polls.
The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey, said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for the simple tests that start Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it's possible that Saturday afternoon's foursome test was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-oscling compass of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players actually believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where's their motivation now?
"They led us by six points, now it's only four points, so we're relying on this drop for a little motivation", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, with 12 points remaining.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons to encourage, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls into the green zone with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those party gutters became louder as the round progressed, especially as he scored a crucial point in which he tied the score in Game 4 after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The pitch he won at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game", Spieth says.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europeans have won four out of four games and it seems they can't go wrong.
Moliwood was the only pair that didn't need any extra hits on Saturday afternoon, but this claim applies to Saturday morning, and Friday afternoon, and even the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the belief that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday.
Preferably both at the same time, in different holes.
The discussion of the glory of Europeans remains premature, for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overtook Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs test, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
One extra hit and two doubles at the first nine holes sunk the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep they were not even close to getting out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The fourballs and foursome samples are fascinating and worth watching closely because of the interactions between pairs, the tips given and not given, and the way a strategy can be changed on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead after finishing the fourballs and foursome matches on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins to a reluctant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes at the morning fourballs test and won the series 3-1.
The United States opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two games but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to score four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair nicknamed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points from the four opening matches in the entire history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball test, they held out superbly to beat the discouraged Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer score of 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in both Saturday matches, had occasional flashes of genius, but so far has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursome matches, seven of which were consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome test and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world No. 1 and No. 3.
Europe, however, did not have a smooth journey on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They managed to win 2-1 against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs test, then came back later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursome test after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the playoffs, although, as the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need a tie.
However, after being in second place for two consecutive days, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says there's no chance of disarming unilaterally as long as there's no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen distrust of the United States and that it was impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that North Korea implemented "significant measures to prove its good faith" last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and a commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
However, we do not see any appropriate response from the US, he said.
If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities, and under such circumstances, we can't unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar objections to Washington's opposition to a "de-nuclear" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, his statement was significant because he did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as Phenian has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between a sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress towards a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump offered assurances on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not responded to requests to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US insists on the option of denuclearization first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even objecting to the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The impression that sanctions can get us on our knees is an illusion that only people who don't know us have.
But the problem is that the prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, over the past five months, adding: If the denuclearization issue had been negotiated with South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.
Even under these conditions, Ri's tone of speech was very different from last year's speech when he declared to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target US territory with North Korean missiles after Mr Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage in initiating the disarmament process, but said that work had only just begun and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned time frame for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two or three years or five months".
China and Russia say that the Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council: The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Phenian again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said progress had been made, but after only a few hours, North Korea reported that he had made gangster threats.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch pad and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
He said Kim told him that the appropriate measures he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking classes on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing Macho culture that makes them undergo training sessions all night long, energized by caffeine.
One scientist has found that students at the most prestigious universities in the world often do not even know the basic concepts of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after he gave a lecture about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
Finally, a girl came up to me and said, Why am I only being told this now, in the last year?
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which premiered this year, explains to students the key concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a series of interactive tasks.
A section shows the image of a living room, and students can click on coffee pots, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
We know we can't instantly change student behavior.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking are", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud of having been studying all night is still there, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Sufficient, good quality sleep should be a student's secret weapon for fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even for avoiding weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think the body is hungry, which makes students feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his first-year courses at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is for all graduate students to be required to complete a similar program of study before enrolling in this highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set up an alarm to know when it's time to go to bed and when to wake up, and to know what are the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's team down
Rangers suffer another case of depression on the move as Dolly Menga's strike sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted their first victory on the move since their 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second 18-game defeat as manager, putting Rangers eight points behind Hearts, the authoritative leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before break and the uninspired Rangers players didn't seem to be able to draw for a second.
Rangers thus dropped to sixth place in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind Hibernian, by a single goal difference.
And Rangers could face other problems, as coughing referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the lawn of the visiting team's fans.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot that won easily against Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to get a Hearts tie last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained batting has suffocated his opponents throughout the game.
Even though the Rangers had superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more efficiently.
He was supposed to score just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor-defended gate, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent it to the bar.
The Rangers took over, but they gave the impression they had more hope than they trusted in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak kick.
Although the 34th minute goal by Livingstone did not match the game's trend, no one can deny that it was well deserved, even for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga, who finished with a simple hit.
Gerrard acted at the break when he replaced Ryan Kent with Coulibaly; this move almost immediately paid off when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of nowhere to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the exact same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting center after center.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs's shot, then Lithgow sent his head to the side of the gate with the corner shot.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve at Rangers, asked for a penalty towards the end of the game when he hit Jacobs but, again, Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanac on Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and counting continues...), is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger meter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has become essential for pop culture as in the 1950 film The Clopouts of San Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboys with unlikely inclinations toward science:
Man: What's that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive atoms emitted into minerals.
Evans: Yes, there's a lot of banging!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and destroy harmful cells
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can detect a protein common to many cancers and then they are reinjected.
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a vaccine-treated woman who is teaching her immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can detect a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.
HER2 determines the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and teach them to target cancer cells, has also worked for treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a supporting speech for Trump while wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a loose show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he planned to run in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
 Often when I talk to a white person, I'm asked, How can you like Trump?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star thwarted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the footage of West's diatribe was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get West on the wrong foot with this post.
Besides, West complained to the public that he had backstage issues because of his hat.
They tried to intimidate me in the background.
They said, "Don't go out wearing that hat".
I was attacked!
They also told me that I was very low, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how low I've gotten?" and then he said "I'm going to grab my Superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments drew public outcry at least twice, and members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety reported; one person on the team told the publication: "There was complete silence in the studio".
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of eyebrows when he performed the song I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits among us: Thank you for facing the world".
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply, "He was himself, and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their arta) who I believe embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name; West is following in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected Monday in front of the Belfast Court.
The charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the War of the Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the macho hero stereotype, saying that portraying these roles on screen makes boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that she felt that something was wrong and wondered how to handle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow Throne Rooster Rose Leslie, now 31, admitted that he was "very determined" to talk about the matter.
"Personally, I'm very determined to talk about this now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?" he asked himself.
What have I taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we're facing right now?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through highly masculine characters.
He continued: What is born and what is taught?
What do young boys learn on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he admitted that he would not be playing in any series based on Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, saying he was done with the battlefields and horses.
From November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that ever happened to him because of the show Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I made this show, so it secured my family's future and my life from now on", Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of Chinese citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of diseases result from inadequate measures of sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee disclosed the data to Republican Party senators, speaks about dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
Rep. Maxine Waters denounced Saturday allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were made by analysts and websites of the "extreme right".
"Lies, lies and other miserable lies", Waters said in a Twitter post.
The disclosed information included the addresses and personal phone numbers of the senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information came online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to be a Supreme Court justice.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and provided information to a member of Waters' team, Hill reported.
"These baseless accusations are completely false, an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The team member whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false allegations was not in any way responsible for the leak.
These baseless accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
They must not question the prosecutor's motivation.
You have to be calm and calm".
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on Twitter.
"Important, if it's true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered", she continued, "and that they will be held accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions to any of my team members".
Johnny English hits again: The unflinching spoof of spy movies, starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit-related meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the parody series of action films starring Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will this ridiculous satire of how we're weird become the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the eyes of a blind eye and the face of a rubber, was renewed for the second time his license to spoil everything.
He is, of course, the well-worn secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a little Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of the kind that contributed a single note to the musical theme of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious homeless man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercials, who left chaos behind.
This last J.E. affair has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blade hit his hair slightly.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially because the "serious" movies, such as those from the 007 series or Mission Impossible, confidently offer comedic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be more for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's whimsical adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise has always been that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the UK's top-secret spy web and revealed the identities of undercover British agents, to the dismay of the service agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for a pompous and besieged prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis due to declining political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her character like Theresa May, but the script doesn't give her a chance to shine.
Her intelligence officials inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate an agent in the reserves.
This is Johnny English's own zzzz, now working as a teacher in a high school, but also teaching undercover agents.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, then reunited with his longtime partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and valuable character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit wasted.
So these Batman and Robin of the mess messing around in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls for a charismatic billionaire tech industry man who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of outrageous adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak aboard the luxury Volta ship, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when they try to use a set of virtual reality glasses to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but however cute and colorful the film is, it looks like a children's television production.
A rather mediocre film.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labour denies they plan for British workers to work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week but be paid for five days.
It seems the party wants the company bosses to take advantage of the savings possible from the AI revolution by giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the wages would not change.
Sources say the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda, which wants to tilt the balance in favour of the workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek is being supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changing economies.
A source from the Labour Party leadership told The Sunday Times: "An announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a suitable aspiration in the Labour Party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the Party's overall strategy on industry.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day work week was one of the promises of the Green Party in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.
The Lord Chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to take back power from the "unfavorable directors" and "beneficiaries" of utility companies.
The Lord Chancellor's plans for the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that current shareholders in water supply regions may not fully recover their shares because the Labour government could charge deductions for found crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the boards of directors of companies and to set up ownership funds to transfer 10% of the private sector firms' equity to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to around £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on the 60 Minutes show if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination for Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded to stop supporting him because of the FBI findings.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
I've said that since the beginning of the hearing; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was determined, prompt, unequivocal.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be digging in the rock.
"I'm determined in regards to Brett Kavanaugh, so we'd need some explosive charges", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett firmly rejects the accusations", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she named confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it succeeded in doing something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that will feature an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
Now in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn, not only to follow artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to pay for a number of tasks or actions such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls, or other significant things that help raise awareness of the goal of ending global poverty.
But what success did the Global Citizen Festival have when I was only 12 years old to achieve that goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to get them to act or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism, a concept that refers to people who feel they've accomplished something by signing an online petition or posting a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million actions from its supporters promoting different goals have been registered since 2011.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries committed to helping children grow to their full potential, which pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book, Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund The Power of Nutrition, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use naval forces to blockade Russia's energy exports, Interior Secretary says
Washington can, if necessary, call on the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's engagement in Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
I think the reason I am in the Middle East is because I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe, he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and methods to handle the situation.
"The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not go out to the market", he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that claims to be the voice of the energy consumer in the US.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement, he said, saying of Russia that he knew only one trick because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says would turn Berlin into a "prison of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline at 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin stated that the US fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we look at things the same way: energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Secretary of Energy in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted critics from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem with a third country intervening in our energy issues, said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday she must seriously consider whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During the meeting at Holyoke Township, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that requires a strong woman", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I'll be seriously considering whether to run for president.
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the city council meeting, saying that he was "directing the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated Supreme Court nominee.
In a tweet posted Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that neither did most Warren voters believe they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy for former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy for him and 48% are against it.
Other names of some very well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin is talking about the post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin is suffering from at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
"The things my own son goes through, the things he went through after he came back... I can understand the suffering of other families who are feeling the ramifications of post-traumatic stress disorder and the effects of the wounds our soldiers come back with", he told a crowd gathered at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest the elephant in the room and said her son and other war veterans came back a little different, tougher, they came back wondering if there was any respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed forces and air force, as well as all the other members of the Army, did for the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia contest a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape gang-related or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae petition Friday in Washington to support a challenge to the asylum policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner and his violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state's attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing a widespread problem of domestic violence and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such limitation violates this principle, the amicus curiae application states.
In addition, lawyers argue in the request that the policy of refusing immigrants entry is affecting the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and supply the necessary workforce.
In June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion, Sessions said on 11 June, when announcing the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll has doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is parked with her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
Ambulance cars bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient.
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded property, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude Richter earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spinal and shoulder fractures, are resting outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replies.
He has tears in his eyes when he remembers how he felt the violent quake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of abusing propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the US press to distribute propaganda material.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the surcharge paid by China to Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections, an accusation China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising that promotes trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that involves waves of tariff increases on imports.
Tariffs imposed by China in retaliation at the start of the trade war were created to hurt exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
By spreading propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is breaking the American tradition of free speech and a free press, writes Branstad.
"Instead, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will see no real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He added that one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are alienating female voters before midterm elections over the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual abuse charges, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
"These reactions will not be forgotten", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative to investigate an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Come November!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news website.
People say they were already very big, and that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, aged 18 to 29, who, while dissatisfied with the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought to the nominee's Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has turned into a mess for Republicans", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh can be confirmed, but how the Republicans have handled the situation and how they have handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic voting support group, told the news channel.
Yet Americans seem to be relatively divided on the part they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more people seem to believe the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly believe or think it's likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35 percent said they strongly believe it or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her, in a state of intoxication, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is global dominance.
"Now we have to do it", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data archives or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, schedules, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this personal data consolidation.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute the right resources, processes and skills so that Solid is available to everyone.
Currently, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely messed up all at once.
We don't ask their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the cleric who won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross medal as a combatant in World War I was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during the Rushden, Northamptonshire parade.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "symbolically amazing" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal through a very thick fog and under intense artillery and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with fantastic bravery, opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest himself and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I know I'll never be able to match, but that makes me feel humble.
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to play a role in the parade and added that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but they got cartoons featuring Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event, only to be unable to watch the main event.
The San Jose event schedule contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not at all satisfied, because they stayed up all night watching the fight.
One fan described the move to children's cartoons on Twitter as a kind of bad joke.
Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6am, so they had to switch to children's programs, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yeah.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future they would schedule their events in such a way that they could be watched by viewers in the UK.
"When I think about resumes, I think we could probably work it out", Coker said.
But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to sort it out, I thought it was a technical mess.
But that's not what it was about, it was government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We're going to get five fights instead of six, like we usually do, and we're trying to give the fans more and we're going over the line.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got to school that "not everyone is like me".
As a guest on the first Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay rights to give others hope.
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the traditional show, will be away for a few months due to illness.
Invited to Laverne's first edition, Daley said that as a child she felt inferior to others because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said, "Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength and the resilience to achieve success".
He wanted to prove he was someone, he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of appearing at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live freely, without consequences, and because he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said he was taken by surprise by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but has stated that age difference has never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age - he participated in his first Olympics when he was just 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone of his age who has gone through the same good times and bad times.
The two became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, which, Daley says, changed his whole outlook.
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in winning a gold medal", he said.
You know what? There are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to know was if he had gotten tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
I couldn't tell him you couldn't be first, Dad, he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I dreamed of my whole life, jumping in front of my country's Olympic spectators, there's no better feeling", he said.
This also inspired him in the music of his choice, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still moves him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was passed over on the bench Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday for the 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to get back in shape to make sure it's not an unfortunate opportunity.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was moved to the reserve bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursome trials.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States team, the major tournament winning quarterback split his day between being a cheerleader for teammates and practicing his blows, hoping to right what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had his best drives, even at the peak of his career, so he's not the best choice for the narrow field at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish wrong hits.
And if the pitch isn't a big enough challenge, in Sunday's ninth game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points on their way to the 12 playoff games, which must begin strong at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the shoulder, he hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Fame member and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably never imagined he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how I thought we should proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never been above his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought some intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to joke with the players, he's a great guy in the team locker room", he explained.
I think the young players are having fun playing with it, it was fun to see them do it during the week.
His role is more important than just the game.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the Ryder Cup trials can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to beat them by a minimal margin of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
I remember that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win, Bjorn said (pictured) after watching the 2018 team that won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and my team that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let's get out on the field and make it perfect.
The game is not finished until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, that must remain the goal.
I always said, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also know what's waiting for us on the other side: the best players in the world.
Enchanted by the way his players have handled a difficult field, Bjorn added: "I'm not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a whole different situation.
Tomorrow, individual performance is important, and that's different.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to be in their best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better in the playoffs than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three of their four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such a comeback on the final day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe achieved the "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every word", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, managed to encourage his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow and we'd like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield games.
We've created the proper lot and ordered the players as we like, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the programme.
"I chose this group of players in that order because I think it covers all the subjects", Bjorn said of the lot for the simple test.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
Germany's newest naval frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War warships, but this will not happen until next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The commissioning of the vessel Rheinland-Pfalz, the standard vessel of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery have hampered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are supposed to be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and stealth technologies that provide a radar, infrared and low-acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to be able to depart for missions of two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these latest-generation warships, which are said to increase Germany's naval strength, will be outdated before they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate engineer was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware" defects that would have rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the crews of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship proved to be much too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-tonne ship Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, became a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an astonishing figure of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), down from the original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy had begun to run out of ships to be sent on missions.
The official stated that the problem has steadily increased over time as old vessels have been decommissioned without being replaced by new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates entered service with the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
New research that is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how bats use their environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unprecedented flying mammals and help future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will examine common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as ear-watering bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located in key locations around the property to track bat activity during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
They will also produce a habitat map and report to create a detailed, scale-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as lawn creation and what is the best way to maintain forest grassland for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting their nests and habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, just like fly traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, check out the nests, and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve, the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bat species in Scotland are found.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave, the area is wonderful for bats", he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to reproduce.
It highlights the importance of searching for bats before carrying out maintenance work on property, as the simple unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which could destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species".
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers prepare to sue the magazine in Germany
Cristiano Ronaldo said the accusations against him are fake news and that some people want to advertise using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the football player paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video posted on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo said that these were "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today is fake news, the Golden Ball winning squad said in front of the video camera.
I want to advertise using my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will seek damages for "moral damage equivalent to an appropriate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada, District Court.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he was a good boy  in the ratio of 99 %, and that he was betrayed by that one percent.
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she has reported to the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she was warned of the possibility of retaliation and was worried that she would be humiliated publicly.
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that agreement because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giant Juventus after a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of carmakers
Britain would regret forever losing its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'concerning' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker stated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have stated that they fear leaving the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini is made for a month.
The main concerns are raised by what producers call the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of 'fix-to-time': for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, border problems could arise, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a spare parts shortage.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's inventory at its factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border delays".
"There has to be a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success we have now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful supply chain set.
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that higher prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the plant in the long term and would ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager at the factory, said the members are increasingly concerned: "I have learned from experience that after these jobs disappear, they never come back".
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election interference, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, thus endangering Mueller's independence, have been circulating in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump claimed he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which again delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There is no date yet set for this, it could be this week or it could be delayed by a week, given all the other things happening at the Supreme Court now.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in briefings was not due to dislike for TV reporters who like to perform, though he added: "I don't deny that they like to perform".
Then he suggested that it would increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President attends more Q&A sessions than all previous Presidents, she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: We have analysed the figures.
"There will be more briefings", Sanders said, "but I think it's much better that the press has the opportunity to address questions directly to the president of the United States, not me".
We try to do this as often as possible, and you can see that we've done this many times in the past few weeks, and the discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available.
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening by making an improvised, bizarre appearance in front of the press.
A Secretary of State for Health writes to EU National Health Service (NHS) staff in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS Scotland branch to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their wish for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter on the condition that there are less than six months left until the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, with decisions expected to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government has begun to prepare increasingly for a different scenario, where there would be no agreement on leaving the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head Saturday in a game his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores, 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the shooting took place shortly before the break.
"It got to the cough line and just collapsed", Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by the physical preparers and medical staff on the cough line before being placed on a stretcher and transported off the field for a detailed evaluation.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details about the type/scale of the accident and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five plays in total before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 plays in the entire season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on the purchase of a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp court fee on the purchase of a property in the UK, with the additional money to be used to help homeless people, according to new Conservative Party plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
The stamp duty will be applied to non-taxpayers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty rate on the purchase of a property in the UK and the additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising lower-priced homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher stamp duty will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxpayers in the UK and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help the homeless.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the two-year high levels for secondary property and rented properties, could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring in a surplus of up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, leading to rising prices and putting those looking to buy their first home at a disadvantage.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign shoppers spending much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
It accused the major construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of land purchases without using them and asked Theresa May to waive the fees for affordable houses in order to solve the UK housing problem.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive real estate reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to unwarranted evictions.
It also wants to give the councils more power in building new houses.
Theresa May said the following: "Last year I announced that I would dedicate my term as Prime Minister to the fulfillment of the British dream, a better life for each new generation.
And that means fixing the real estate market problems.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK residents and companies based abroad can buy houses as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and living in dishonest conditions is far too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the Scotland national team"
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland, said his ultimate goal was to become Scotland's national team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East club, which is currently in 3rd place in the Premier League, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Lighthouse team this summer after managing to return St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We made the B team and that's about it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I spent much of my childhood watching Scottish matches in Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as manager of the club.
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager has said he has no emotions about being the successor to such established names at such an important club after he turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The only thing that concerns me and could affect my success is the question Can I help this team get back to the Premier League?
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities at this club allow it to be in the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to help the club get back to the Premier League.
Ross has only three years of managerial experience, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the C-Division and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team to win the championship the following season.
Ross has stated that he is feeling better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a decisive moment", he said of taking over the management of the Alloa club.
I actually thought I was more suited to the role of manager than the role of player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we won well, and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I'm in similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel like this is the right role for me.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now that I can do that, I feel like it's the best thing that's ever happened to me in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00 on Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
This summer's heat wave has led to a rise in UK pub revenue, but putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars increased by 2,7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4,8%.
Peter Martin, representative of CGA, the business consultancy company that carried out the survey, said: The constant heat and England's participation in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to the previous month, when pubs had up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers down 1,8% in the restaurant industry since June fell even further in July.
Pubs and bars that serve only drinks have made a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have recorded heat losses, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people have gone out into the city just to consume drinks.
Sales of drinks at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, representative of RSM, a service provider in the hospitality industry, said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important contributors to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to lose, although a fall in sales of 4,8% per year will add to current cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food business operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2,7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched locations.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined profit of over £9 billion, the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
According to one survey, one in five children, some even under the age of 11, has a secret social media account that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram accounts
News has raised fears about sexual content posts
20% of students said they had a primary account that they showed their parents.
One in five children, some even under the age of 11, creates an account on a social network that keeps it hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in Insta False accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
The news has raised fears about sexual content posts.
20% of students said they have a main and clean account that they show their parents, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account noticed a teenager posting asking to be raped.
According to research by Digital Awareness in the UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC's director, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don't have access to.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Athletes' Commission for Scotland
Eilidh Doyle was elected as Director, without executive power, of the Athletes' Commission for Scotland at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for decision-makers in sport to benefit from the vast experience it has gained internationally over the past decade.
Eilidh is respected by the entire community of athletes in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits once he is included in the committee, Beattie said.
Doyle added: "I am delighted to be able to represent the athletes and hope to make a real contribution and help the way sporting activities are carried out in Scotland.
The American athlete, who won the 200m and 400m events at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to her four Olympic gold medals, is now a frequent commentator for the BBC, having been invalided after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether or not I will recover.
It was a titanic job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
A breast pump ad that compares women to cows divides public opinion online
A breast pump company has sparked public opinion online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is to be the world's first portable, silent breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack for cows on a tune that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm full, but I don't have a tail". And "If you haven't noticed, these aren't my hives, these are my breasts".
The chorus continues: "I pump, pump, breastfeed babies, pump, pump, extract milk from girls".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been met with mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it exposes the "hours" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen only a few days after birth, wrote one person.

Another person commented: "It's understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "Extremely inappropriate advertising".
Others defended the ad, one person claiming that it seemed like a hilarious ad.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping actually made me feel like a calf.
The ad is a little off the charts, but I took it that way.
But the product is brilliant, wrote one person.
Another person commented: It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and who feel like "Baby".
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with the discreet pumps inserted into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like calves.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their babies in their arms, and even to go out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother commented: Pompa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what it takes to use a breast pump and the challenges in that regard, presenting in a fun and real way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were smuggled into a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made the sponsorship process harder.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear they will endanger their stay in the country if they apply to adopt children.
The risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors, as well as other adult family members, would have to register their fingerprints and that their data would be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Approximately 80% of the people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors live illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we'll continue to look for the individuals, Albence said.
To speed up the processing process in the child system, the authorities introduced new rules that children must appear in court at one month from detention, rather than at 60 days as required by the previous standard, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead the case through a video call, and not in person, before an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempted escape, according to shelter employees and reports released by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are being raised at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is the possibility that signs that a child is having problems are not being observed because of the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to a refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many already suffer from.
Syria demands that the US, French and Turkish military forces withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the situation would be properly managed.
"This must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally", he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He also stated that Damascus will continue this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.
There are approximately 2,000 U.S. military troops in Syria, who are primarily engaged in training and advising the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that there were favourable conditions for their return and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears, which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return.
Political influences are brought into an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped prevent a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a clear deadline and expressed hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra Front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and are to be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the committee's activities should be limited to the 'review of the articles of the current constitution' and issued a warning against interference.
Why will Trump win a second term
If we follow this logic, Trump will be reelected in 2020, except if impeachment or scandals end his presidency earlier, which is what a lot of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of a presidential term ever!
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time viewers have doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, the prime-time Fox News channel is watched by an average of 2.4 million people, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has a record audience of 3.5 million people on the night of the big news.
This is a topic that appeals to the public, because we can't understand it, said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC's drama series Reserve President, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a disastrous attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can be integrated and about the state of the global economy.
Changing jobs is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you're not just an informed citizen when you get to the sixth hour of a panel of experts watching the debate on how Bob Woodward uses sources deep background (confidential) for his book, Fear, about Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket (a clumsy object, according to The Washington Post) and the implications of actress Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Trump's anatomical parts.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A lot of what he does makes you feel like you're watching a reality show and feeds you with topics every night", Brent Montgomery, executive director of media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Hostage Assets", said of Trump's constantly changing distribution and daily upheavals (the launch of a pro football league ring, the praise of Kim Jong-Un).
You don't let yourself miss an episode, because you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his home on the north shore of Kauai Island, it was 27 degrees outside and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording on CNN.
He couldn't get away from the television, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember doing some out-of-the-ordinary shows in the past, and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right.

Overwhelming external financial resources for the closest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a rearrangement of constituencies, resulting in two incumbents running for office in the same election, it is hardly surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new Pittsburgh suburban district has brought Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb into the race, who won another district's special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
Electoral charts were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating the boundaries of the districts in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th electoral district triggered a campaign funding competition between major party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, primaries election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
For more than a decade, the office was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador because of its deal with China, but then dropped out.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization leadership team.
State Department officials decided to call in the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only taken against the state of El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rate.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials in North and Central America have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, officials at the head of the administration had made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the administration's importance to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving any further messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is directing his investigation into the existence of a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia over the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due accountability within the body, even as he prepares to appear before voters and possibly a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations, and I don't want to suggest that a Trump decline is inevitable, which is true for his European counterparts.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make that will determine the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to launch a coup against Hitler only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing some of these critical moments right now.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this paper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein has stated that the Times' report is incorrect.
How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we're gonna fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence a long time ago.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the charm.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to their advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we'd get a good result and we won a point.
We could have probably scored in the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first replay, and we noticed better in the second.
Thursday, it will be another important night for Europe.
With a little luck we'll get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game played.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but things are better now.
The team's fine and the boys really like being here; training goes well, too.
Let's hope we persevere, let's put what happened last season behind us and get good results.
Women are sleepless because of retirement savings
Although the survey respondents clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of these said they had spoken to their children about the subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't start that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Here's how you can start.
Discuss with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide the care you need if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve your financial advisor: the financial advisor can also be a real help in paying these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a cash-based mixed life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses, or you can insure your own well-being  as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: come face to face with legal issues.
You get a power of attorney for medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and to make sure that the professionals in the field respect your wishes if you can't communicate them.
Consider also making an authorisation on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that an elderly parent of yours has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not just about the financial side of it. Can you tell me who the doctors are who are doing this?" asked Martin.
What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Write a plan for all of these things.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communication networks, disaster authorities could not obtain any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu City, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by the tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over a coastline of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, an administrative region at the bottom of a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture activities are the focal point of the economy of the province in the centre of Sulawesi, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining activities are also important in the province but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala Regency, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in the north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude Richter scale earthquake struck south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 Richter scale earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have been killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude Richter-scale earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in Pidie Jaya Regency of Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recalled the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami, which claimed a large number of lives.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapsed buildings.
2018: Several strong earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit awaiting trial, and is being held on bail of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded 100% innocent when his plea was sought, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A felony charges, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with such a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, involving himself in a domestic violence complaint and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress disorder he suffers from after serving in the military forces in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off the central province of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media is streaming videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutor's office wants the death penalty for the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
The New York federal prosecutor's office wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It appears that Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot-chartered truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side of Lower Manhattan Highway, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its trajectory in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm, according to the intent notice on the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges can be sentenced to death, according to the court document.
Within weeks of the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required substantial planning and premeditation, prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "abominable, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a death penalty case in the Southern District of New York.
The outlaw, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not express any regret in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to investigators that he was pleased with what he did, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the recluse.
Also, according to the police, he asked to plant the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the office defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to apply the death penalty.
A Conservative MP claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to mobilize the civilian army during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel pressure from eurosceptics, following a statement by MEP Theresa May who suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK would have left by now if Farage had been Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge May faces in the highly divided camps has been heightened by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest against leaving the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister is working hard to get his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, going properly, facing attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to stay in it, and the European Union.
Allies stressed that she will continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her offer and haos.
Bone said at the Solihull Brexit event that he wants to "leave the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were running things, we would not be in the European Union", he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, representing the Wellingborough constituency, added: "I support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan.
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he stated: "We did not fight in world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone denied suggestions of changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: "It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union".
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party who supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and our activists who go out and support us in the first place in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message to Theresa May, she added: "The prime ministers who keep their posts are the ones who keep their promises".
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put under pressure if they are to back down on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let them do that.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the country's civilian army that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that read 'The Conservative Party is against Brexit' after the group launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in applying the party at the start of the conference.
These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for digitizing customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland, he added.
It's a farce.
The EU's economic and social cohesion policy is also a key factor in the EU's economic and social cohesion.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future Saturday during a mayoral meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican member of the House of Representatives who co-chaired Donald Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she might beat Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of voters using the mayoral format since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government and that included a woman at its forefront.
A suspect in the death case that caused the death of player Sims from the LSU team has been arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the death case that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death, police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, to having a gun, and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6'2" (1.98 m) junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, starting 10 times last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team would play an essential role in the race.
Ranked first, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at boxing and left Hamilton at the tail end of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped boxing one lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free after making a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back row of the carriage and was seventh near the end of the first lap, just on his 21st birthday.
He then held the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally stopped boxing at lap 44, but could not step up in the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, and Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and he behaved like a real gentleman, letting me get in front of him.
And the team did an excellent job of getting the win over Ferrari and achieving this double, Hamilton said.
A terrible body language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally over her insistence that she did not facilitate the leak of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were bad, immoral and liars.
The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that's happening these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and liars, he said.
When you see that they published and leaked information and then they say they didn't.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the leak?
Do you remember her answer? She said, um... look?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't do that.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do that? No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred from her office.
"I didn't cover up the allegations against Ford and I'm not the one who facilitated the leak", Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and that's exactly what I did.
But her denial didn't seem to have worked well for the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday: "To be honest, it was terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the most horrible body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own ends.
I am determined to seize power in any way possible.
Look at the wickedness, the immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to gain power and control, the president said, according to Mediaite's website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars paid for Friday's loss in the Elite League, winning against the Belfast Giants in Saturday's replay, 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with the strikes being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer returned the Giants to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard tied the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who had recovered the ground by beating Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their final three games.
Dwyer's opening act kicked off in the fourth minute, 3:35, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford made the decisive move to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamically, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 1:10 p.m., before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to score for a 15-16 lead.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard tied again with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later in the second leg, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus securing the team's promotion to 5th place in the standings, at the halfway point of the last leg.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will be hosting Milton Keynes on Friday for their next game.
An air traffic controller died after taking off a plane carrying hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake rocked Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Several strong protests have taken place in the area and many people are trapped beneath the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palua, which was shaking strongly.
It was left in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped from the air traffic control tower when he noticed it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for the Indonesian air navigation service provider said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palos.
"We are distressed by this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, with the National Disaster Management Agency stating that access is limited in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe the number will increase because many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of them", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six metres high devastated the city of Palu, with a joint funeral to follow on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the retail stores are looted.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to provide assistance to survivors, but we don't know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?, CNN announced.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by the earthquake in Lombok, which claimed more than 550 lives.
Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one person is missing after previously stating that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The United States Air Force and Navy said the plane missed the runway and landed in a lagoon nearby.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the runway.
US citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very short distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the waterfront, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the crew panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to renovate a landing site jumped in to help, using a paddle boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank to 30 meters below the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office closed its plea to resume the trial for a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He told the jury how he used the cell phone footage to capture the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her previous claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called to the witness box and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that she had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicate they'd known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
According to the timetable, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide by the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio that plays hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
Bristol-based band The High Breed claim that hip-hop has stopped delivering political messages and addressing social issues as it did in the past.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
A recent resurgence of artists such as The Fugees and Common has been noted in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for firing her after she received a text message that was racist.
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was just a black person.
The couple denied they were racist, claiming that she sued them for extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
Another colorful person wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the flaw, Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, saying that the nanny, who is African-American, had failed to perform her duties properly and that she expected to receive a Filipino-born nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now she sues the couple to pay compensation for their dismissal and asks for $350 a day for six months, the period she was to live with them and carry on her business, despite the fact that this was done without a contract.
"I want to show them that these things aren't done", she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denies claims that they are racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn?
Let's be serious.
Considering the trial an extortion, Plasco stated that his wife will give birth in two months and that she is in a very difficult situation.
Do you really want to get revenge on a person under such circumstances?
It is not done, the banker added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for the behavior and logic they have demonstrated.
The editors of Paddington's story feared that readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a first-time reader before it's published.
It's very funny now, after seeing that Paddington had huge success.
She also said her father, who was a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was a sweet-tasting one after he died last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of our family, she added that her father had a discrete pride in the success he later enjoyed.
He was a rather quiet man and didn't like to brag, she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you're proud of him, even though it's not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad calls frequently to tell me that it's very serious and that he doesn't think he'll survive", Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications given by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to diminish and leave her body.
He had died a short time ago and his organs were starting to fail.
I was forced to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was happening.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I kept my head down and my tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Two mournful women post messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones because they committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them motivational and including phone numbers people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with a mocking smile.
Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changes your mood.
However, he quit his job before he died because he had reached a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking it'll have a domino effect on you".
It created messages to convey to people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out there, you need to talk to someone.
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's longtime friend, lost Mark, her life partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
She didn't tell me she wasn't feeling well or depressed, she said.
A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he had changed his attitude.
She was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day when the children unpacked their presents and she didn't even look them in the eye.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to overcome it: It caused a huge amount of pain within the family.
We are devastated.
But we must go on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the Federal Bureau of Investigation begins its investigation.
I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for  a limited time and small scale investigation we could have a little unity, Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was about to disintegrate amid a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the time factor.
There are only five weeks until the November 6 election - if, as predicted, the Republicans do poorly, their attempts to place the winner they want in the country's highest court election will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept calling on the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not yet clear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the difference in the equality case and uphold it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees is falling under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from South Korea's unification ministry, said that about 1,127 people fled the country last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by those smuggling people across the border.
The Phenian has made no public comment.
A vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers refugees more illegal migrants than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for several discussions that were the subject of denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to work together for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States' sanctions of causing a lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in such situations we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", stating that he is unable to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader in the House of Representatives, described Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and said his temperament was unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice because of emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a grotesque and coordinated character assassination organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think she's disqualified by those statements and the way she attacked the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi strayed from the subject when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court you're in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he's considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say 'wow! what a wonderful thing!'", Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of anger accumulated and she can't speak without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we get angry", Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's anything unusual, do I?
She continued: "I got a lot of help from a woman in an executive position who told me that she cried when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'You might think I was sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous. I know.
And then you keep on.
It seemed like a brilliant thing.
Tears are allowed to express anger, in part because they're fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started crying over an inexpressible rage, is that I was grabbed by the neck of an older woman, a cold executive I always felt a little afraid of, and she took me upstairs.
"She must never see you crying", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad to have caused you that feeling.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision", she laughs, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was over, she was behind on fundraising and swore she wouldn't run unless she managed to raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000, they were only giving her $250.
'Do they think I get discounts?' she asked.
During her speech announcing that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by the emotions of gratitude for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and the anger caused by gender discrimination that she lost her voice because of the emotions.
"You would have said I had a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls of the press' reactions to her.
You would have said one of my sponsors is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.
Did she cry?
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
The sparks that announced the start of the US-China trade war were daunting, and while there seems to be a long way to go before it ends, the quarrels between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation occurred this week with new tariffs, which affected $200 billion worth of products, effectively taxing half of all Chinese goods that reach the United States.
Beijing has been retaliating every time, most recently by imposing a tariff of between 5 and 10% on US $60 billion worth of products.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly giving in to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressure could support China positively in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than previously predicted, said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready for refugee return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things return to normal.
The existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from insurgent-sponsored countries would not be accepted.
European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive European victory and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who put in incredible effort for much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial shot into the water to the 3rd hole from hole 16, ceding the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed incredibly well in all competitions, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost on holes 5 and 4 to the bottom-ranked player from the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost to England's Ian Poulter in the 2nd and 1st holes, which was probably his last Ryder Cup game.
A Ryder Cup veteran who has competed in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful player in Europe, averaging 25.5 points in his entire career.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It's teamwork and I'm glad I could help, Garcia said, excited, after the European victory.
He handes the baton to his national, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, in the individual game on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only to be surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played exceptionally well throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: "I'm proud of them, they really worked hard.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I fought a fierce battle.
Put down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
We must give them the due respect.
They played better than us.
