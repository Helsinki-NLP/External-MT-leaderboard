Welsh MPs are worried they'll look like Muppets.
Some Assembly Members (AM) were surprised by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the chamber the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become targets of slander.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp means asshole.
A Welsh Plaid Cymru MP said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative stated that his group was "open" to a name change, but that the MWP in the speech could quickly turn into the Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce a name change, said: Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentarians will be titled will be up to them.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that found broad support for changing the name of the chamber to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the names of the MPs in the Assembly, the Committee was in favour of the name Members of the Welsh Parliament or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
House members are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring headaches to House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill to change the law within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Chamber functions, including rules on disqualification of Chamber members and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the bill, the House of Representatives will have a decisive voice on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The Commission has also examined the compatibility of the aid with the internal market and the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has stated that he will not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's have gone off as the churches of Harlem struggle to survive.
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today there is neither.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People today are socializing differently", he said.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people regularly hang out.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and that they will either later find themselves back at the beginning.
He added that churches could replace apartment buildings with apartments for people who would not help the other churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore the day will come sooner when these churches will be closed down completely because the residents who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held worship nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since the Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, called carillons.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: "cultural treasure" and "indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, noted that it was also the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing the larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish composed of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "try to shift the costs" to the sacristy, even though the sacristy was not involved in hiring architects and construction contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old while diving for lobsters in California
According to a government report, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour and a half Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help, and then he and a group of others rowed to the scene to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of a lobster catch, but then he realized he was screaming "He bit me!"
He bit me!
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
"I made sure everyone got out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'", Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the bathing public.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid measure is compatible with the internal market.
Sainsbury's became a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style cosmetics counters and hiring specialist retailers.
As part of a major entry into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow in tandem with falling sales in the clothing and home appliances market, larger cosmetics counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetics is one way that supermarkets are trying to use shelf space that was once reserved for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics offerings to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique range of decorative cosmetics, so most of the products will be vegan-friendly, which is what younger customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will pilot concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon in south London and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the return to daily small-scale purchases at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to outbid convenience stores like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitat's divisions since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made those acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the sharing of revenue from the pharmacy in its supermarkets.
The new strategy followed Sainsbury's selling its pharmaceutical business in 281 stores to Celeste, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skincare products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics department to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We've also invested in special training for colleagues who will be on hand to advise customers.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and accessible locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby walked away from an £11 million contract.
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones left to "go on a rampage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby scrapped an £11 million deal with his brand to focus on her new deals with the Marks & Spencer chain and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
Their brand is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of This Morning (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones cooking in anger by withdrawing at the last minute from a jointly profitable business to focus on her own brilliant new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the television golden girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant there was no longer enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The deal was likened to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure her for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire has taken everyone involved in the business by surprise.
No one could believe what was happening on a Tuesday so close to launching the entire line.
At the Marlow Company headquarters, there's a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions in losses from the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares and the possible further delay of the launch of the line.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as chairman in March.
The couples are vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities".
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the press for comments that some might consider "undeserving of the president" and for having such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so many concessions?
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I have made no concessions.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after their June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not noticed the "appropriate response" of the US to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead the US still did not lift sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech to the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We're in danger of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results - halting missile test launches, helping to free hostages and returning remaining American troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside this crowded arena to get in, we'd have about 200 people there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for using international aid resources.
'Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they are not seeking international help, so it is all a bit problematic,' Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pala, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Office, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
With Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still woefully unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palu, although the warning was in effect, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, travel between Indonesia's many islands is not easy.
Natural disasters add to the logistical challenges.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's crumbling structure was the cornerstone of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the government under Joko is struggling with a lack of funds, and new elections are scheduled for next year.
Joko also faces pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslims have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See, Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the equaliser against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League game against Chelsea on Saturday with an 89th-minute goal at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was approximately 30 yards from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 Chelsea win.
He moved the ball to his left foot before kicking it into the opposite tripod.
The ball went high above the goal to the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaja Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and entered the net.
"It was challenging to get in that position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I just touched the ball once.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The blue forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before turning around somewhere in the middle of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
Then he threw a beautiful pass that brought Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defence and hit the ball into the net with his left foot on the opposite stand next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool play a club competition match against Napoli in the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are hosting Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
News agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a large number of people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings after a 7.5-magnitude quake struck on Friday, causing waves up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is littered with ruins.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on people in the area to report if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hogan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would like to be contacted by anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene who claim to know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are in the process of notifying the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but officers told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have now been told it will be several hours before they can return to their apartments.
The officer reportedly told someone that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's so terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced area, and another was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers were standing inside the fenced area and guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, citing the September 30 record 247.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the middle of the debate over "making history again".
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr Crick's attempt "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Ham Thorneycroft's beautiful re-creation of Cromwell is a testament to the thinking of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a person many still consider worthy of reverence.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament from outside pressure.
Whether this view is entirely credible is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is the single most recognizable figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector continue to be worthy of honour and celebration.
A pig killer kills a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man named only Yuan was found dead with his arteries slashed and covered in blood near a marketplace in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, a relative found him dead, and the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that a 250-pound pig had bitten the breeder to death.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named Wu said, "My cousin's legs were bloody and maimed".
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, pig attacks on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor while his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a stimulant.
They're just a setup.
They're picky, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
He just needs to show them respect, he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants bring heavy rains to the southwest United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa was blowing at 90 miles per hour at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 400 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area is forming over the Pacific and moving toward the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin pushing a deep layer of tropical moisture northward toward the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low pressure area will cause heavy precipitation over much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rainfall will cause dangerous tidal floods, mudslides and possible desert landslides.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfall of approximately 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 10 to 30 inches of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Walking in the desert is not recommended because of the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and showers of bushes will bring local gale-force winds and dust storms.
The approach of the low pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
The Commission has concluded that the conditions for the exemption from the notification requirement are fulfilled.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in this region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning before covering a wider area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the border areas of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah and continue through Wednesday.
In October, there could be large temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 80 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C].
Over the next few days, the summer heat will continue to rise and spread again.
In most of the central and eastern United States, early October is expected to be warm with temperatures of 90 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C] from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched six television networks on Thursday's tense testimony from Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political wrangling continued, and reporters interrupted their regular program to announce a last-minute twist that Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, the Arizona senator, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had been drinking, groping her and trying to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh has stated in a fiery testimony that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
Friday's hearing was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people, the number reported by Nielsen.
The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring the number of people who watch content in their offices.
To make it clearer, this is an audience that is similar in number to the size of a football game or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the studio strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership with an average of 5.69 million during the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in a drama that was set on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught him being shouted at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood for a few minutes staring downward as he was bombarded by protesters in front of CNN cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?
They said, "You have power whereas so many women are helpless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed he would say more at the board hearing.
Hours later, all the cable and cable networks were watching live as the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on whether to send Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidates within the next week, as demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign secretary, in another interview in the same issue with her on the cover continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and EU should charge each other tariffs was "total nonsense".
Police arrest Dyton Simpson, suspect in the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on a charge of manslaughter, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the confrontation.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, a CBS affiliate, reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
Bail in the amount of $350,000 has been requested.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The Sheriff's Department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their diligence and search for the truth.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-7 winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate and shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're always worried about", Wade said.
A volcano spewing ash on Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center was tracking multiple throbs and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude-7.1 earthquake in 2017 shook central Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with intervention police and after thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to mark Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists, who apologized to the intervention police, began throwing eggs and paint powder at the police, creating dark dust clouds on streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
Fighting broke out later in the day when police used batons to quell the brawl.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", while unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people have been hospitalized with minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local media reported.
Tensions in the region have not subsided in less than a year since Madrid declared an October 1 referendum illegal, which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters chose independence although turnout was low because those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups took to the streets on Friday night to stop demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations continued, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia to gain independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I watched my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite winning a crucial, albeit narrow victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties are struggling to keep up this year as their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration on his phone in support of the police, said the clash was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since late last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
'Candidating for the European elections is the best way to declare the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government', he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after crashing into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after crashing their car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7.30pm BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the courtyard door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point, a crossbow was fired at the car.
Mantle's goal brought Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Mantle's first goal for Livingston brought the win
Scottish Premiership newcomer Livingston has surprised Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to concede his second defeat in 18 games at Ibrox.
Dolly Menge's goal proved decisive as Gary Holt's team tied the Iberia in the second.
Gerrard's side are still unbeaten away from home in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play Hearts, the league's top club eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt is still undefeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed his chances against the numb guests.
Holt's team should have been leading before they scored that goal, given that their offensive directness was causing a whole host of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his breakthrough, but he was too slow on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only aim the ball wide after he slipped to intercept Craig Halkett's head kick to the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for the guests
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston made the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisting Mengi who hit the center of the field goal.
By this point, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but they were facing an impenetrable home defense, so goalie Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
It continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goalie Alan McGregor's legs were outstretched to Scott Pittman, and Lithgow delivered a wide kick from another organized attack by Livingston.
Long passes failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two eleveners were not sent off after Halkett's clash with replacement Glen Middleton and one for playing hand.
"Great" from Livingston "Great" from the analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
Great game and score by Livingston.
All but one were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on that entry route.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but a lot of credit goes to Holt and the way he's brought the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the helm of a superbly organized defense, and Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall from breathing for the entire game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set for good play under Gerrard.
They couldn't get the ball to the end, and they only put a hole in the home team once, and that's kind of a call to action for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan greeted with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday, everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leaders of Turse and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany  aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police blocked a gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque for security reasons, but a large crowd of the president's supporters who had come to see him showed up nearby.
And hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters  including a large number of Kurds  raised their voices in condemnation of Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks, while others attack him as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist has been killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets on a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run crash on Chiders Street, about a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
City police said officers are trying to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
The accident has closed roads and diverted bus traffic, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riot
The prison administration has announced that six police officers have been injured in a riot at a men's prison.
Riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire at around 0930 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado units have been brought in to quell the riots involving eight prisoners and confined to one wing.
Police officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been called in to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.
Long Lartin Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, emergency police were called to the prison to solve a serious situation in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (possible benefit to dry areas)
Tropical depressions are rare in Arizona, but there is a good chance that they will be early next week when Hurricane Rosa with its remaining strength moves through the Desert Southwest and brings the threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for an area from western Arizona, through southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross straight through on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Hydrometeorological Service tweeted that  Since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have produced a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles [320 km] of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center forecast predicts 50 to 100 millimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 millimeters on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
The Commission has concluded that the conditions for the granting of the aid are satisfied.
For those outside the danger of flash floods, Rosa could come as a rescue as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious threat, some of this rainfall could be beneficial because of the current drought in the southwest.
According to the US Drylands Map, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
The hurricane's path first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa was still a hurricane on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour [80 km/ hr], and was located 400 miles [620 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at 12 miles per hour [20 km/ hr].
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
So it's expected to approach the coast of Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
Total rainfall expected from the Baja California peninsula to northwestern Sonora is between 75 and 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass over Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main threat from Rose or her remnants is very heavy rainfall on the Baja California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the American Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in deserts and on mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset with stab wounds.
At around 0400 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, an injured teenager was found.
He was taken to a hospital and is in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officials are calling for anyone with video of the incident to come forward.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and shameful tactics", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the wrath and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing about the accusation she made.
The president said on Saturday that it was the day the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service", he told supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republicans running for office in the middle of a presidential term.
Five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I am, he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for the great candidates.
Trump has stated that the mission of the Democrats is to "create resistance and obstruction".
An assistant Republican leadership official told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds dead in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number still rising
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of them washed up on the coast by huge waves as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high hit the shore at dusk, washing many of them to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude quake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately and were killed", said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency, at a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived", he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent blows continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to two hundred times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The report suggests that the city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have increased the tsunami's intensity.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
According to Nugroho, the death toll and damage may be higher along the coast 300 kilometers north of Palua, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications are completely cut off and we have no information from Donggala.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area", said a Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers had been dispatched to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse", the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a barrage of criticism for not providing information that the tsunami had hit Pala, even though officials claimed the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur video shared on social media can be heard of a man on the top floor of a building panickingly warning people down the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the wall of water collapsed on the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the army has begun sending cargo planes to help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia claimed over 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"While World Vision staff from Donggala successfully reached the city of Palu where employees were sheltered in tarpaulin tents set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed on scenes of destruction along the way", said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although relief groups have set in motion relief wheels, some have complained that foreign aid workers with high skills have been prevented from reaching Pala.
The Indonesian authorities have also provided information on the situation of the Indonesian fishing fleet in the area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can get international help, but such a state has not yet been declared.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami hit on Friday, friends and families of those still listed as missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate the dark scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, was training two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
"Given the many years I spent paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled how after news of the Roa Roa Hotel demolition spread through the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants who were attending the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray clamp instead of two blue clamp.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee filling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee downtown on Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement says the driver of the car emptied an ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of cash.
While he was busy with that, another man came running up behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to put in an ATM.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene of the robbery, but police did not disclose the number of people involved.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In a Twitter post Saturday announcing the change, he wrote the following: "Live will be officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show's producers said he replaced Ariana Grande, who had cancelled for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I think that ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ti", West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So, I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means "one", to just Ye, which is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, Jay-Z, was playing with the stripped-down and the comic-book versions of his name in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO has promised not to use the military against the citizens
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student riots.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square pledged that he would never use the military against the Mexican people.
Military troops fired on peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly scholarships to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in AI research", said Kai Fu Leeu, an AI investor and AI expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans for AI, although the US in principle lacks a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: to become the number one country in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling investment could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will come in the U.S"., Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Great Power: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat America's top Othello player, and later he was a director at Microsoft's research division and president of Google's China division.
Lee praised the US government's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that's taking out academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on AI research over the past few years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in artificial intelligence.
'I think that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should be given green cards automatically', he said.
The Chinese State Council published the Next Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature that wanted to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked the opening of EU and NATO accession talks.
There is a province in Greece called Macedonia, and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents its own territory and has vetoed that country's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
'Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us', said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has stated that no irregularities have been reported as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, in Strumica on 30 September 2018, approached a referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for joining the NATO alliance and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and moved chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as servants", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said a "positive" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required response.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would represent the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it took office in May last year.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England broke through Brighton's defence and brought Manchester City to a 2-0 victory.
Aguero made the win insanely easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an overtime in midfield at the start of the attack.
He broke through three of Brighton's defensive players and then he got to the open field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four opponents in green jerseys.
He passed one defender, then passed a few more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he added a left to Sterling.
England's striker on his first try returned the ball to Aguero who threw a right-handed pitch into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulties with his foot", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We planned on him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first ever Premier League lead.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's pitch during that game.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful pass along his left flank.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before guiding Sterling to the tripod.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before it slid into the car.
Manchester City will take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to stop the Rockies from advancing.
With the Nationals players out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to insist on a fresh start.
But always competitive, Scherzer is hoping for a win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, make the playoffs.
The Rockies' 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night at least secured them a wild-card spot, but they're still hoping to win their first title.
Even if we're playing for nothing, we can at least throw knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would be playing at the highest level I'd witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but apparently, in that case, they're more inclined to offer Scherzer a game.
Scherzer, making his 34th start, warmed up in the pitching area Thursday and will play Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record this season, a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president, during a speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the general election, made a few comments about his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
Everything we've built will be put to the test in November.
It's only five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones -- I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates, he said.
Trump continues: "Look at this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
Their intention is to take back power by any means necessary; you see the evil, the corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to trample to take power and control; that's why they want power and control.
The Democrats, he says, have a mission to resist and obstruct.
"You've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats evil, evil, corrupt and liars.
He called Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which caused a loud public outcry.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you released the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the documentary. That was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer respects differences of opinion.
He does not tolerate personal views.
I wasn't too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome and all because we said what we had in mind.
I believe my congressional colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I've been a local Labour Party MP, the main council meetings on Friday nights have been just like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings these days go by in a different tone, and the promise of a kinder, gentler policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started not long after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues who I thought shared similar political views began to demand a drastic change of mind and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with  whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I address the public  and it doesn't really matter what I say  there's a flurry of insulting words on social media calling for my impeachment, denying the policies of the centre and telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that have been made to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me the most is the tolerance of abusive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every motion of no confidence or change in election rules we become a more narrow-minded party.
I've been advised many times over the last two years to lower my head, to be less loud, and to be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, spurred on by the neglect of Margaret Thatcher's government that had left my school's multi-purpose classroom in ruins, I've wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one at the Nottingham East Branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the motion on Friday is that at a time when the country is grappling with Brexit which will negatively impact households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political advantage will deter me from acting in the way I believe is in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr  Melrose: 38: 17 undefeated Ayr heading for the top
Two late attempts may have had some bearing on the final score, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win this extremely exciting match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
Now they've moved to the top of the standings and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, a top defense and a better use of opportunity led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
"They've tested us every game so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: "All praise to Ayra, they took their chances better than we did".
A 14th-minute attempt by Grant Anderson by Frazier Climo brought Ayr into the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was sent off by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to improve, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unrealized attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead by eleven points before, at halftime, he scored and made a solo attempt to change the score for Ayr at 17:5 before halftime.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and a shot by Patrick Anderson, who made Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
Then a long break occurred due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott who was carried on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr continued a good game with a try from Stafford McDowall who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, with an unsuccessful attempt by Bruce Colvin late in the game under heavy pressure.
The winger, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for knocking out Clima who did not have the ball; from the penalty spot, MacPherson carried the goal behind Ayra in full swing of the penalty.
Climo realized, as he had done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took a high kick from David Armstrong and sent out winger Gregor Henry in the home team's fifth attempt.
The star of "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kiernan, star of the series Still Game, seems ready to resume his service activities after it was revealed that he has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the much-loved BBC series which he co-wrote and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to air, and it appears that Kiernan plans to devote himself to life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in a growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will grant it access to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling a crane-filled naval base in La Paz.
The flag of the color of the ocean is reported on public buildings.
To the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the cry is: "We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to return it.
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost coastline in favor of Chile during the 19th-century resource conflict is still alive  just as the longing for renewed voyages across the Pacific Ocean is.
As Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice due on October 1st, after a five-year trial, those hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of difficult negotiations, is obliged to negotiate a cede of sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's ruling.
"We're aiming to bring back the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely to change much, and that if it did, little would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings means that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have set them back.
"The issue of access to the sea has taken over the current Bolivian leadership", said Zarate.
Morales' war-mongering rhetoric has buried any goodwill in Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will resume dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "break 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America  used the maritime issue as a political stick.
'Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past.
North Korea has said it will not go nuclear unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never denuclearize if they can't trust Washington.
Ri addressed the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, coming more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says sanctions have been continued because of "unbridled imagination" and that the US's opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to support a declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to give up what it likely sees as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows reveal that the last line of large headgear is on its way to a luxury store in your neighborhood
Whether you want to enhance your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne hit the runway with a line of offbeat giant headgear for their 2019 spring and summer collection and delighted fashion fans at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been Instagrammed this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the runway.
The outstanding example was Valentino's large beige hat with a wide feather-like border that completely took over the model's head.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapples, but these accessories are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lip seams and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a windbreaker and mask, and the other looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
If you follow the great fashion saying "luck is on your side".
Stylists predict that giant hats could come to the luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats go perfectly with the La Bomba heels, a straw hat with a circumference of approximately 24 inches that has been seen on many celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that took social media to the fashion runway has sent another great creation  a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
A faint orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia stripes and a white leather handle, was featured in Jacquemus' La Riviera 2019 summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer.
John Edward: the language skills that the citizens of the world need
The Scottish Independent Schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test scores, with added weight given to individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further education and higher education, careers they want, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement the above curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the preferred and preferred subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English alone if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest marks in languages were achieved by students from independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils achieved an excellent mark for Mandarin, while 72% of pupils learning German, 69% of pupils learning French and 63% of pupils learning Spanish also achieved the highest possible mark.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as electives are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) in the independent school curriculum, as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of employers were unable to fill jobs due to a lack of a language-skilled workforce.
Language skills are therefore increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs demand language skills, these skills are crucial in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choice, people who learn to speak a foreign language will in the future experience the long-term benefits of such a skill.
A person who speaks several languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives him an advantage over his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults, 75% of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, more precisely 15%.
So investing in language learning is very important for children today.
Learning more languages, especially those of developing countries, will help children to find good jobs.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will opt for languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which they can learn and prepare themselves with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be ignored that in this age of global business, language skills are very important for the future of any country, and this must be reflected in education.
So knowledge of modern languages really should be seen as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer language choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It has to be done right.
John Edward is headmaster of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play his first game in a Laker jersey Sunday in San Diego.
Fans will soon be able to see LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers news anchor Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this point in my career, I really don't need a preseason game", he declared.
Trump holding rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off his campaign with a rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned rallies Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court justice and plans to increase support for the upcoming election because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose their majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does Trump's rally in West Virginia start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 pm Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have sparked controversy over sexual assault allegations.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans gain the upper hand in the November election.
So Trump's presidential campaign said five rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and increase their majority in the Senate and House", Reuters reports.
"The majority in Congress is so important to the president's plans that they will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the tumultuous campaign", an anonymous Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as Pittsburgh media, reports the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for Senate, Patrick Morrissey of West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president needs to help him improve his rank in the polls", West Virginia University political scientist Simon Haedar told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA leaves heart on the field before Sunday's individual events
After three one-sided sessions, Sunday afternoon's pairs match may be just what it takes to turn the Ryder Cup around.
"The wheel of fortune turns" is a saying that applies especially in sports and that athletes believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who's wheel of fortune is in favor now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they have four, so I think luck is on our side right now", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans have a four-point lead with 12 points remaining.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouragement from his pair of Justin Thomas, with whom he won three of four points after a full day of play.
Spieth played killer from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheers of the fans grew louder as Spieth and Thomas trailed by two points, culminating in a crucial road trip that brought Spieth to a draw.
After his 15-hole lead, a similar cheer followed, one that could be identified by the hope and faith that the Americans can turn things around.
"You just need to concentrate and focus on your game", Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
The European odd but irresistible couple has the maximum score and can't make a mistake.
The only couple to not lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
That winning streak, and the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari, shows that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than these two who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Le Golf National in Paris.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it's still too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took out Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in the morning doubles match.
One bogey and two double bogey on the first nine holes of the course buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't dig out of.
However, on Sunday, there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch pairs up close because you can see the interactions of the pairs, hear the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and study the strategy that can be changed in an instant.
The Europeans have been playing better as a team so far, and they're coming into the final day with a significant lead, but this pair-play also showed that the U.S. team has the necessary fighting ability, which some, especially Stateside, have questioned.
The Europeans enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead.
The Europeans after Saturday's pairs on the final day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant lead over the United States of 10:6.
The dynamic duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led by four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team in their quest to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago outscored the US team in the morning doubles match by a score of 3-1.
The U.S. team showed more combative in the doubles, winning two games, but the points gap was already huge.
To win the Jim Furyk Trophy, teams must collect eight points from 12 individual games played on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in a pair in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball, they proved superior in the match against Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 win.
Woods, who hasn't shown his best performance in two games on Saturday, has made some brilliant moves, but he's now down 19 of 29 games in fourballs and doubles, and seven straight.
Justin Rose paused his morning fourballs to return to the doubles game with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepke, the first and third best players in the world.
But Europeans were not exactly on their best day southeast of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, setting the bar high for their U.S. team.
First they beat Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in the fourballs, and then they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the doubles after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team trailing by four points has managed to come back in the singles, although Furyk's team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days of delay, it looks like their Sunday counterattack will be hard to beat.
North Korea has announced that "there is a chance" for unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust of the United States and that there is no way North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test station and deciding to halt development of nuclear technology and weapons.
'However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States,' he added.
If we don't trust the United States, we don't have faith in our national security, and under the circumstances, there's no way we're going to be the first to unilaterally disarm.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would see sanctions on North Korea gradually lifted, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever meeting between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has made it a condition that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation before that and is increasing pressure through sanctions to force its way through, and even opposes "declaring an end to the war", Ri added.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just the delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust.
Ri did not mention whether there are plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting that the US president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held three meetings in the past five months, adding: "If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this standstill".
Regardless, the tone of Secretary Ri's speech was very different from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and declared that the targeting of the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim "the man-missile" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courageous disarmament, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea completes denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearization, adding: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified denuclearisation is achieved.
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said he had made progress, but North Korea called him back after a few hours over "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex, which will be done if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim had disclosed to him that these "appropriate measures" related to the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course on how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat the growing culture of caffeinated study and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's best university often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea for the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did I only find out about this now, in my last year of college?"
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic achievement and overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, says that the university decided to introduce the course after students were noticing a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks involved a picture of a student dormitory where students had to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects performance, and the importance of a sleep routine.
During the course of the lecture, students also learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Afterwards, a campus map with interactive icons is displayed to encourage students to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect your health", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in studying all night before exams persists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The professor says that a student's secret weapon against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety should be good quality sleep, which also helps fight obesity because sleep deprivation affects the brain, causing it to starve and become hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student in California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his first-year lectures at Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar course of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm during sleep and wakefulness, aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights that can disrupt circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston  Rangers 1:0 Meng's goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's shot cut through Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the game with Livingston winning 1-0.
The Ibrox side were looking to take their first away win since their triumph in February and 4-1 result at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his side now trail eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership behind leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into halftime, and the Rangers seemed to run out of inspiration and didn't look like they were going to tie the score.
While the Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, Livingston has moved up to third with just one point behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the flanks and thus struggled alongside Ayra into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was going with the same attitude Livingston had with Hearts last week and he would have been thrilled that his well-designed stance had stifled any attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston had more to do with it.
They had a chance to score two minutes after Meng was first dismissed, opening up the scope for Scott Pittman to go for Alan McGregor's goal, however, the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free throw was intercepted by captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an inaccurate punch to the rear.
The Rangers were in control at one point, but in the final third of the game, they seemed to be playing with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the referee should have awarded him an 11-under in the 15th minute of his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not consider the Colombian's request.
The Rangers managed to get only two balls into the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's one-hit header by Lassane Coulibaly and the stupid kick by Ovie Earia were no big deal.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play slowed the game, no one can deny their effort.
The Rangers again missed a deep Jacobs return.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his focus and chose Meng for an easy finish.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, a substitution that had almost immediate effect as the winger added the ball to Morelos, but was blocked from his line by an impressive Kelly.
But Livingston continued to lure the visitors into the exact game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett delivered one long punch after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide angle shot.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late for an 11-under because he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago... the birthday of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this invention later developed into the device known as the Geiger counter.
A mainstay of science since that time, the Geiger counter became a mainstay of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Colorado", starring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in God's name is that?
It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals.
Look at that, it's so loud!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot bad cells and destroy them
 A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The procedure involves removing immune system cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory
The cells are treated to recognize the protein that is common to many cancers and then injected back into the patient
An experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various cancers.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer receded for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory to "recognize" a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer", explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from a patient and teaching them to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, joined the debate about Trump and supported him, wearing a hat that read "Make America Great Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a performance with interludes in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat that read "Make America Great Again", he continued to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
Saturday Night Live kicked off with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault claims.
Although not broadcast, a video of West's speech was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the Rock was trying to frame West with the ad.
West also complained to the audience that he was being thrown behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
They were teasing me backstage.
They said, "Don't go anywhere with that hat".
They were harassing me!
They said I was sunk, Washington Examiner reports.
West went on, "You want to see the bottom?" and said he'd put on his Superman cape because it meant I couldn't tell him what to do.
Try with love.
Variety magazine reported that his comments had caused public outcry on at least two occasions, and members of Saturday Night Live appeared to be embarrassed, with one person telling the magazine: "The whole studio went silent".
West was brought in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, stunned many.
West has endorsed Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest men of spirit: Thank you for standing up to the Mafia".
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "his own man" and that it was absolutely wonderful.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music, their clothes or by supporting their art) who I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name to follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to the symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder with a knife in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with the attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police have reported the incident at Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in the Criminal Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has succumbed to toxic manhood.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the swordsman in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor challenged the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such television roles often make boys feel that they have to be tough to earn respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a fellow Game of Thrones cast member, admitted that he wants to "take a very strong stand" against this problem.
"I personally feel very strongly at this moment "where did we go wrong with manhood?" he asked himself.
What did we teach men as they grew up, compared to the problem we now see?
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on screen, may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued: "What is born, and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel they have to have these particular male traits?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming any Game of Thrones sequels after its conclusion the following summer, and said that he was "done with the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's play True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he felt meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him on the set of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife while filming this show, which gave me a family and a future", he revealed.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Keith's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
Around 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that almost no people are infected with HIV in this way.
Yet, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a persistent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Studies estimate that because of conservative values in the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry.
Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships occur because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to address the problem, the Chinese government in 2003 promised free access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked information about GOP senators to the public, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff leaked the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles assures us that these claims are being spread by ultra-right wing individuals as well as websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters tweeted.
The released data allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication of this data belongs to the office of Representative Waters, as well as information about the representative's staff member, The Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
 A member of my staff  whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations  is not responsible in any way for the leakage of these data.
These baseless allegations are completely false and utterly false.
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted online critics, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is a furious denial", wrote Fleischer.
It shows that Waters doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's been accused of something they didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He's not allowed to question the prosecution's motives.
He needs to be calm and composed.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticism Democrats have directed at Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also tweeted.
"It matters if it's true", he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that her office had notified "the relevant law enforcement and government agencies" of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and that they face legal consequences for any actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet", she continued.
Johnny English: Back on the job: Not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson fights against a spy
It is now common for every new British film to look for Brexit messages, and it seems to be the case with the new adaptation of the action series Johnny English, whose first sequel, Johnny English, first aired in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011 with the title Johnny English Rides Again.
Will the twisted satire of how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with his jagged eyes and rubbery face has permission to complicate things again, while his name says more than anything that this is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He's, of course, a wacky secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to "diluted" glamour, is reminiscent of Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr. Bean character and somewhat resembles the guy who sang the one-note opening song to "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious worldly man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercial for Barclaycard and who is the epitome of chaos.
There's a good moment or two in this latest release.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propeller briefly struck his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually redundant, especially now that "serious" movie titles like "007" and "Missions Impossible" also offer elements of comedy themselves.
The humor feels like it's meant for kids, not adults, and in my opinion, the wacky, out-of-control, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out-of-the-box, out of the-the-box, out of the-the-box, out of the-the-box, out of the-the-box, out of the-the-box, out of the-the-box, out of the-the-box, out of the-the-box, out of the-the-out-of-the-box, out of the-the-out-of-the-box, out of the-the-out-of-the-out-of-the-out-of-the-out-of-of-the-out-of-of-the-out-of-of-the-out-of-of-of-the-out-of-of-of-the-of-out-of-of-of-the-of-of-the-out-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-the-of-of-the-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-of-of
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a generally accepted fact.
A hacker has hacked into Britain's most secretive spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents, much to the horror of the on-duty agent, unfortunately briefly played by Kevin Eldon.
This has spilled over into the Prime Minister's patience, a haughty and belligerent character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray the character that should represent Theresa May, but she hasn't exactly gotten the material to do anything with.
Her intelligence advisers reveal that all active spies have been compromised and she will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person will be the reckless Johnny English with the head and the beard who is currently employed as the principal of some fancy school, but secretly teaching how to become a secret agent: here are some hot gigs because English teaches rocker-style espionage.
English is quickly brought to government premises for an emergency meeting, where he reunites with Bough, his former partner and eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential has largely been squandered.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything wrong are back in action and meet the beautiful, fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their thrilling journey with absurd and hilarious incidents: waiters disguised as hotshot French restaurants cause a huge disorder by sneaking onto the Volt luxury yacht, and English causes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headphones to find out what the inside of the Volt house looks like.
Everything is done right for this final sequel, but as appealing and flashy as the film is, it still contains a lot of childish elements.
It's a pretty mediocre accomplishment.
And as was the case with other films about Johnny English, I wondered again if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that matched his talent?
Labour Party rejects plan to make British work four days a week and get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan to make the British work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could "fit" into the party's economic program and plans to make the country more supportive of workers' interests.
The union congress has supported moving to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year".
The four-day workweek will not be achieved overnight, but it represents an aspiration that fits into the approach this party has to balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to lend its support to such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this trend.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a party policy and the party is not considering it".
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to wrest power from the hands of "impersonal directors" and "profiteers" in utility companies.
The Chancellor's shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their full stake because the Labour government could make 'deductions' based on the irregularities detected.
It also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive equity funds to give 10 per cent of the capital of private companies to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the agency's finding could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any chance the FBI might discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more forthright than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I said go to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the allegations were made, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, unwavering, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, is like it's carved in stone.
"I'm firm on Brett Kavanaugh, and I really need a strong indictment to change that", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied everything", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the persons she nominated could corroborate her claims.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive roster of stars and an equally impressive mission  to end world poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to Central Park to not only enjoy performances by celebrities like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness about the event's real goal, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or actions such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making phone calls, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen really, given that it has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" where people feel that by signing an online petition or tweeting they are really making a difference?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million Actions by its supporters that aimed to achieve a number of different goals.
He says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will result in more than $37 billion in economic benefits affecting more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Commission also noted that the Group's financial situation was not in line with the requirements of the Restructuring Communication.
The Group estimates that the insured funds have so far directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and broadcasters committed to helping children develop to their full potential, with a pledge to provide $35 million in aid to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
'With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens around the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,' Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Foundation, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project which will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, which read: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responds: "It will be a long and difficult road - we will fail sometimes.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Performances by Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts to perform at this year's New York City event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports ̶ Interior Minister
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russian involvement in Syria ̶ especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government ̶ is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy in that area as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe", he says.
But he believes that there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the opening of sea lanes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event hosted by the nonprofit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which bills itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less exploitation and substitution of fuels", he said, and for Russia he says "the same trick is used" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The announcements came as the Trump administration intends to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts state senator
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During an immediate meeting with the citizens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the helm", she declared, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet she posted on Friday, Warren says, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe political research center poll, fifty-eight percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed a stronger support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent voting for the potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in connection with a potential 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision by January, reports The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin is mentioning PTSD to Trump at a rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after volunteering in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident that occurred Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he comes back, is comparable to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers come back with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that she's been keeping quiet about and said for her son and other war veterans they come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the military, have given to this country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a friendly report Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner and violent members of his gang had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries that face pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has changed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
'Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle violates that principle', the report of the friend of the court states.
Lawyers further argued that policies that deny immigrants entry hurt the U.S. economy, arguing that they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as casualties double in the race for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting harder.
"The situation is very tense", said Risa Kusuma, 35, a mother, as she comforted her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulances are bringing bodies in every minute.
The government lacks clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, sifting through flooded things, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwyane Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Pallu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the tremor that shook his fifth-floor hotel room with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was trapped inside the rubble of the wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" through "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily promoting mutual trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials in a statement to Reuters characterized as a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to put up ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, China's top agricultural exporter, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper, Branstad states that China "is now doubling down on this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"Through its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
 By contrast, on a newsstand on the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubling economic trajectory because the media are under heavy pressure from the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that some of China's most prominent newspapers had declined the offer to publish his article, though he did not say which newspapers.
Kavanaugh's debacle has Republicans alienated voters ahead of the midterm elections, analysts warn.
With many Republicans supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defending him over several sexual assault allegations, analysts warn that this will lead to backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event have been extremely heated, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to cast their vote.
Such things cannot be undone", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's recent insistence on an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched down the Senate aisle as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports The Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news outlet.
People say they're already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest there could be a backlash if Republicans continue to confirm.
"This is a real mess for the Big Old Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the bench, but also about how the Republicans approached it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, executive director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news outlet.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more prone to him.
A new poll published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony to be true, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that her Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party during his time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing based on Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said, referring to the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal network storage or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on the same browser at the same time.
What's unique about personal online storage is that the decision of who can access what information is entirely user-specific.
The company calls it "Data-driven Personal Empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that was bought by IBM, a few engineers who signed on to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world were able to build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they're going to introduce a complete overhaul that would completely reverse all of their business models overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial power and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross awarded to a World War I priest
A celebration in honour of the only Church of England priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War was held in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's feat for which he received the honor.
According to a report in the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St Quentin Canal through very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed to the front lines and with "incredible courage" led the unit forward before single-handedly charging into a Polish cannon and cutting down three of the troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's works were "something I know I could never achieve, and it's humbling".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honoured to be part of the parade", adding that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and instead got Piglet Peppas
Imagine this - you stay up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches only to end up unable to follow the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main roster, and in the UK, they were shown live at night on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their match, viewers in the UK were left in shock when Peppa Pig interrupted the broadcast.
Many were not impressed after staying up late just to fight.
One fan described the interruption of the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
"Under state regulation, this content is not suitable for airing at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
- Yup, Peppa Pig. - I know.
Bellator president Scott Coker said he would be aligning his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I consider a replay, I think we can probably work something out", Coker said.
Well, the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to get anything done until Sunday when it's already Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was cut off, there was a lot of correspondence going around that wasn't very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't, it's a matter of state nature.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which we usually do.
It's just an unfortunate circumstance.
Tom Daley felt "inferior" when it came to sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he entered high school, he was not aware that "not everyone is like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympics was less important to him since he became a father.
The longtime regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a backstabber on Laverne's first show, Daley said that growing up he felt "less valuable" compared to others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and being different from others have been the real things that have given me the power and the strength to succeed".
He says he wanted to prove he was "somebody and something", so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT advocate and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who's 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you're so young you go through so much", he said, looking back on his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find someone his age who hasn't had similar ups and downs".
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the whole story would be about me winning the gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son shares his name with his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not gonna be here long enough to be in the front row,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he came out, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to jump in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
It was also the inspiration for choosing the first song ̶ Proud by singer Heather Small ̶ which echoed in him during the preparation for the Olympics and which he always raves about.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of form on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back into full form to avoid an uncomfortable turning point.
Mickelson, playing in this two-year event for a record 12th time, was sent off by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games with four balls and four quarters.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and honing his game in the gym hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding terrain of Le Golf National, where long, uneven terrain routinely punishes inaccurate shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces British Open defending champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has won all four of his matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are 12 games out of the game with four points to spare, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man ̶ more than that he couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a celebrity and he's contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine he'd play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's what happened, and we felt we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence has brought some intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for the team", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving away a lot more than a game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that a great advantage may soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into an awkward race.
The Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, where the team of captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended in their victory by a narrow margin of 141⁄2 ̶ 131⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a big advantage in Valderra; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderra, where we won, but by a narrow margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You'll be playing at full strength tomorrow.
Get out there and do it right.
Nothing's done until the floors on the board are sounded.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's what the focus remains.
I'm talking all the time, focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're very aware of who's standing against us ̶ the greatest players in the world.
Enthused by his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never run in front of an ore in this.
Tomorrow, we'll face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main one-man show, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're there as an individual, the ultimate test of your golfing skills are the golfers.
That's the message you have to send to the players, and that is that they have to do their best tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate alone because he has to give his best.
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of these big turns on the final day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser after Europe performed the "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, cheered his players on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you should be looking to get great results right at the start like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When that shot goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
So we organized our lineup and set up the guys like, you know, we're going to try to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
I decided that this group of guys would go in this order because I think it's all-encompassing", Bjorn said of the players selected for the individual matches.
German new warship put back on standby
The German Navy's newest frigate was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014 to replace older Cold War-era warships, but won't be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the ship Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit reports citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery have hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
The Commission notes that the new vessels are expected to be deployed in the near future, but that the new vessels will be deployed in the near future.
However, the constant delays mean that the most advanced warships ̶ which are said to allow Germany to show off its power abroad ̶ will become obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would make the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
Also, the ship proved to be dramatically overweight, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project ̶ including crew training ̶ also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) ̶ from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy is actually "running out of ships capable of deployment".
The official said that the problem has increased over time because the old ships have been retired and there are no replacement ships.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
New research at a Scottish Highland estate aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), will follow the common and swamp dwarf bats, as well as the brown long-nosed and river bats in Inverweather Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameras will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile scans using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' voices and what each species is doing.
A habitat map and a report will then be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect shelter and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly nets and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, their night-hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, shelter inspections, and occasional rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave's property in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a huge space for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we are doing here and at other facilities will help us to better understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the accidental destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young, likely wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Bat Society, urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their population is progressing".
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the rape allegations made against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video posted to Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal, you know?
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the footballer added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting on privacy concerns", Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99 percent a "good guy" who was let down by that one percent.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared retaliation" and was "afraid of being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to cancel the deal because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100m move.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
Britain will forever regret losing its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that, in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant ̶ which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis ̶ produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, we will experience production stoppages at our plant,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnston.
The Commission also noted that the UK had a significantly higher share of the market share of the Union industry than the Union industry.
BMW, for example, says it's going to close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The Commission has also examined whether the measures in question are justified in the light of the facts available.
Toyota's production line operates on the "just in time" principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota's Derbyshire plant could not hold more supplies than needed for a day, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan Theresa May is offering for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.
"We need to make a deal.We want to reach the best possible deal that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success but also to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
 Evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers shows that we absolutely must be able to continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but they warned that in the long run, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnston union member and Unite member, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs go, they never come back".
A government spokesman says: 'We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back another week as the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the assistant attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a rumour in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these claims.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of the announcement that he was just resigning.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not want" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh indictments, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week considering everything else that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to report everything to the press.
Some journalists would dispute that claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference at the White House on September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, though she did say, "I will not object to the fact that they are messing around".
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more Q&A meetings than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've analyzed the numbers".
Short speeches will still happen, Sanders said, but while reporters have the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make that happen often, and you've seen that over the last few weeks, and it's precisely that you can talk to the president of the United States that will replace brief speeches to the press.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre performance before a gathering of reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The Minister for Health has sent a letter to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and wishes for them to stay on after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimburse the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal resumed, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the line of scrimmage and just fell", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further tests.
A spokesman for Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had just come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no details on the type/scale of the injury and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, is playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five tackles before being ejected from the game, bringing his total to 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK
Under the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee for buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters
The increase in the fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year ̶ to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged higher fees when buying property in the UK ̶ and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and target high-wage ones.
The increase in the fee will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay UK tax, and the additional money will contribute to the Government's efforts to tackle homelessness.
The additional charge ̶ added to the current charge, including the increase introduced two years ago on other houses and real estate purchased for the purpose of issuance ̶ may be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who do not live in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to join the homeowners' community.
Many affluent areas of the country ̶ especially the capital ̶ have become ̶ghost towns because of the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help more young people get to their first homes.
He accused the big building firms of keeping property prices high by taking land but not using it, and called on Mrs May to give up her quota on affordable housing to remedy the "shame of the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unprovoked evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my term to restoring the British dream - that the lives of each new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that non-UK individuals, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as British people.
The dream of homeownership has become too far away for many people, and the shame of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The Scot (42) is enjoying the challenge of reviving the north-eastern club, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points behind the leaders.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after last season he again managed St Mirren in the Scottish Football League.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always brought me back.
But that opportunity could only come if I was successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
The former boss of Alloa Athletica says he was not afraid to inherit such famous names at such a big club, having previously turned down invitations to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this point will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
"Because of its structure and content, this club is definitely in the Premier League", he said.
It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could get the club back there.
Ross is just completing his third year of his managerial career, following a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloy recover from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled taking over Alloe.
I really believed that managing was more my thing than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, making a solid living, and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management seems like the real deal.
I've always wanted to be in charge, and now I am, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life.

The perfect time to pee is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to research.
The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for British pubs struggling financially but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in revenue in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of business advisory at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which compiled the data, said: "Continued good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July would be similar to the previous June, when pubs' revenues rose by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now even more affected.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenue in June only worsened in July.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market failure in the area of the supply of alcohol.
Pubs where food is mainly served also suffered from the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars they run, sales of drinks rose 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales fell three percent".
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent annual drop in sales will be especially painful because of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant owners, and time will tell if the cooler temperatures we experienced in August will provide a much-needed respite.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the growth of the branded share.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and has established an industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Instagram pages.
News has heightened fears of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social networking accounts that they keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts - references to a photo-sharing website.
The news has heightened fears of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students reported using the cleared "main" account to show their parents, while also having private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site found a teenager who was encouraging others with the words "rape me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to having private accounts.
HMC's chief executive, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletics at the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Committee as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated female athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to tap into her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her being a board member", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of the sportsman and I hope I can really contribute to sport in Scotland".
An American who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, out of his four Olympic golds, and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting, but he made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today he's doing agility exercises!
Thanks for the encouragement messages!
Internet divided over a traitor ad comparing mothers to cows
The advert of a drug company that compares nursing mothers to cows that excite a muse has caused a rift on the Internet.
To mark the launch of what it claims is "the world's first silent wearable wearable", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new wearable gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to music that says, "Yes, I can see myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a wimp, this is my breasts".
Then comes the chorus: "Pump, pump, pump, I'm feeding my baby with it, pump, pump, I'm husband to my lady".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the dairy industry's "miracles".
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen days after they are born, wrote one person.
Elvie's traitor discreetly fits into the breastplate.
Another person comments: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But, yeah, why not use them to advertise the dealers for mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone added, "A totally irrelevant ad".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "ridiculous".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
Giving milk made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product, she said.
Another person commented: "This is a fun commercial aimed at moms who give milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they've all been dancing with discreet trailers placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who give milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie trailers, however, are completely silent, have no wires or tubes, and fit discreetly into the breastplate, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go outside during the trailers.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: "Elvie's Traitor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between depicting women and a cow, we wanted to bring the focus of betrayal and all its challenges, while also demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that a new betrayer will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's traitor made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the tough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children in the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by coming forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to take fingerprints and share the data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who filed to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors in the country are illegal, and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
"We are therefore continuing the search for these individuals", said Mr. Albenze.
According to the shelter workers, in order to speed up the proceedings for the children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to present their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to statements from shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities like Tornillo, where, because of its size, signs of child abuse are likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause the trauma that many children already struggle with.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be "dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the War on Terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territory was cleared of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks to resume.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, "who will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to revising the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump should win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
There's no sign of viewer fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, the hit date audience has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has outperformed the network with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime time nights.
"It's the fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell said.
There's something fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of abortion laws resulting from Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Being excluded is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
But still, you go beyond the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for six hours discuss how Bob Woodward used "deep background" sources for his book Fear, about Paul Manafort's $15,000 owlskin jacket and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, of Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"Part of what it does to make it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "The Secret Room", about the rotating cast and day-to-day intricacies of Trump's show (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss' home this week, it was sunny outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, with a temperature of about 90 degrees Fahrenheit [80°C], but he was inside watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past, and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from the outside is being left in the most uncertain midterm congressional race
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to a congressional redistricting that has resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburban district is highlighted by Democrat Conor Lamb who won a seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against the other incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally biased in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th District has triggered a campaign finance battle between the major party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Convention Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely-watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considers whether to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then pulls out.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the US diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the sanctions are only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as a breakthrough in efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
The history
Next up could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible Trump obstruction of justice, for which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign secretly colluded with Russia as part of its attack on our election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to re-enter the voting booth, and perhaps eventually with a jury of his peers.
There are many of them, however, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his kind in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only for the West to oppose him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such inflection points, and the relentless march of democracy speeds up or slows down.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested filming the president and speculating on his unfitness to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the recently commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair "or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in a midterm congressional election that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once dined in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candle on that table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing the Rapids from Vienna
Rangers are hosting the Rapido from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until a 2 - 2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could make something of ourselves and we got the point.
We might have stolen the game in the end, but, generally speaking, a draw is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good run in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can now move on, put the past season behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep for fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people discussed it with their family members.
About half of those surveyed in the Nationwide Study said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Get your legal documents in order: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Engage health care representatives to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals honor your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving your financial manager a power of attorney.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Put the details in a written plan so you're prepared.
"It's not just about the finances, it's who the doctors are", Martin asked.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan handy.
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was returning home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications cut off, emergency officials were unable to get any information from Donggale Province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
The fishing and agriculture sector is the mainstay of the economy of Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hits Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits the island of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died when the building collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, the CTUU report says.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about a plea bargain, he pleaded "not guilty, of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been the subject of criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullah Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare death sentence for a federal crime that hasn't been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bike path along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, cutting up pedestrians and cyclists who were in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points lead to the possible death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and foresight", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucca, the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last tried a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to hang an ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were clearly disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea for life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must have "felt the pressure" of Euroscepticism "because one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union".
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have "gone on" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May has faced in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is being highlighted by pro-Remain Tories joining a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit, Remain and EU.
Allies insisted that she would continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash ̶ and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ̶ chaos ̶.
Mr Bone said at a Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to scrap Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers".
In expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also in the march, addressing reporters with the words: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
In a prominent message, Mrs May added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they deliver on their promises".
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be made to "feel pressure" if they are to defy the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us people and our political classes", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'you're not going to get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A number of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they suffered with the party's app during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology for a Canada plus plus plan, for unimpeded border state, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at a live chat with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's campaign co-chair in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's been at the center of speculation for some time that she might be challenging Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The judge asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the helm.
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims that occurred Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of 20-year-old Dyton Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
On Friday, they released the video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a weapon and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge County Sheriff's Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-3 freshman who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games at the starting lineup last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.

From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that teamwork would play a big part in the race.
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position for the first two laps and called Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to get into the traffic at the start, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit lane one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a wheel-on-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver reluctantly free-riding in danger of falling behind after a double-step move in the third corner defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race as he gave up his tyres to make a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally got into the ring on lap 44, but failed to pick up his pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a long day because Valtteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me in.
The team did a truly remarkable job of getting the formation finish, Hamilton said.
That was very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she didn't release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and nasty and dishonest".
"The one thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the publicity and the leaks, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't.
Hold on a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't, he added imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not release her story", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, which she did.
However, her denial did not meet with the approval of the president, who commented at the rally on Saturday night: "Let me tell you something - that was very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power at any cost.
You see the evil, the ugliness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, are the words of the president, Mediaite reports.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 ̶ 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5-3 win at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took a two-point lead in the first few minutes with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to a tie, and then Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard had tied for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won their previous three games.
Dwyer's opening touchdown came in the fourth quarter, at 3:35 to be exact, with an assist from Kendall McFaul, with an assist from David Rutherford to double the lead with a Beauvillier four minutes later.
In a hurried opening, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie to tie the game at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first quarter with a lead when he scored his second goal that night late in the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a tie in the match play with a 27-37 goal.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to Dundee's first lead late in the second quarter, and he took the win when his team was already halfway through the fifth time in the last third of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will host the Milton Keynes Raiders in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a massive earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the swaying control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air flight 6321 which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken for this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster mitigation agency says access to Donggali, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising as many bodies are still under the rubble and many could not be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 20 feet high tore through the city of Palu, where a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing bodies in every minute.
The government lacks clean water.
There's little shops being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one man is missing after earlier reports that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air New Guinea said it was unable to track down any of the passengers as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the plane went into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized Saturday and all are in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to break through waist-deep water to the exit in case of danger from a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on repairs to the harbor also helped rescue people using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
The Commission has also received information from the Indonesian authorities that the air carrier Air New Guinea has been involved in a serious incident involving a passenger aircraft.
Analyst's running a weather report on the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday completed a case in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used the cell phone data to piece together a puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which contradicts his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the records showed his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records indicate they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her texts, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hal.
The defense should begin its final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
What is enlightened hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative attitudes towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a singing group from Bristol, claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are being reborn in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for firing her after a racist text.
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text from her mother calling her "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist, likening the charge to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016 to find out that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"Not another black woman", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent it to Madame Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "embarrassing" situation, dismissing Ms. Maurice, alleging that their then-former nanny, an African-American, was not doing her job well and was expecting a Filipino instead, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay and is seeking $350 a day for the six months she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do these things", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to claims of racism by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing to do, fearing that the insult would make her untrustworthy.
My wife didn't mean what she said in the text.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist, said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on, you know what?
Plasco said his wife had only been given two months maternity leave after the baby was born and was in a "very difficult situation".
You're gonna sue someone who's in that situation.
"That's not very nice", added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not identify with the talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who will read a book for the first time before publication.
It's very funny what we now know about Paddington's huge success.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before a teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was a rather quiet man and was not a braggart", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt like some achievement of your own child: you're proud of him even though none of it was really your doing.
I think he viewed Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always credited Paddington with the credit.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say he was really bad and they believed he wouldn't make it", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications her doctors gave her to keep her heart functioning slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died just before we boarded and that's when it all went out.
I just had to sit back and wait knowing what was gonna happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all to myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - unaware of the trials she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I lowered my head and tears kept coming down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong sense of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
A woman mourns on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a chef with an infectious smile who had a brilliant career ahead of him.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said his smile could fill any room with joy.
However, before he died, he left the job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to have a negative effect".
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of the cards... so people would know that there was someone you could go to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't sit in silence ̶ you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling sad or depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was at the bottom of the barrel. When the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or want anything else.
She said that his death was a great trauma, but that they had to get over it: "It leaves a big hole in the family.
He's throwing us out.
But we will keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought we might be able to bring in some unity if we really managed to get something like what he was asking for ̶ a time and scope-limited investigation", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "break up" amid a deep-rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance was prompted by a choice of moment.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, then they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to bring their man to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators over and over, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
It's going to be voted on in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his Supreme Court seat.
The number of North Korean defectors is falling under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the Ministry of Southern United Federation, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year ̶ compared to 2,706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and higher fees charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of the North Korean defectors eventually became South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South ̶ who are still technically at war ̶ have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work towards denuclearising the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not possible under such circumstances that we disarm first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that a woman, if she ever behaved like that, would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated smear" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not participate in the Supreme Court proceedings because he showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he's attacking Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
When asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi backed down.
"I'll say this: If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only incapable of being on the Supreme Court, he's not even capable of being on the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion laws resulting from Roe v. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh has bypassed questions about whether he will overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this great?'"
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, anger that has built up over months and years - all of this cannot be disposed of without pay.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a former CEO who said that she cries when she is angry, but she developed a technique that, when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she is talking to: 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was that one time, while I was crying in an unspeakable rage, an older woman -- a cold manager who I had always been a little afraid of -- dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
With the campaign already behind schedule, she was behind on fundraising, and vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of the supporters, who had given the men $1,000 each, had given her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
As she spoke about not running a formal campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions ̶ gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger over sexism ̶ that her throat was tight.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown", recalled Mrs. Schroeder of the media reaction to her.
You'd think the Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were gonna put on my tombstone.
She cried.
How a US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The onset of the U.S.-China trade war has resounded loud and clear, and while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs that affected products worth $200 billion, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to strike back at the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is not going to give up anytime soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by easing its demands, but public submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could provide a long-term positive boost to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to trigger economic collapse in both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers believed", said Abigail Grace, a strategic thinker with a focus on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism', he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorist attacks to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 ̶ 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, struggling for most of the tournament, on the par-3 16th hole, sent the ball into the water on the first pitch, giving the fight to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in every round, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth has been sent off by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player on the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia, has become the European with the most victories in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop crying.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the cup again.
"I'm happy to have been able to help", said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who on Sunday in the singles event beat legendary American golfer Tiger Woods, 2-1.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find a way out all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-flight golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard".
At certain moments we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll get together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to people.
We're out of the woods.
New data on red tide: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows an overall reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, heterogeneous algal bloom conditions are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties ̶ indicating a decrease in concentrations.
Red tide stretches about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The bloom sites can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red tide was also reported in Pasco County.
In the past week, moderate concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County or its associated coastal area, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County or its associated coastal area, normal to high concentrations in Manatee County or its associated coastal area, normal to high concentrations in Sarasota County or its associated coastal area, normal to medium concentrations in Charlotte County or its associated coastal area, normal to high concentrations in Lee County or its associated coastal area, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation cases are still being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
