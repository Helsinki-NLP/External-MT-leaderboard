The Prague stock exchange fell to minus at the end of trading.
After the morning's sharp fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
The transactions in CEZ shares amounted to almost half of the normal daily trading.
The Prague stock exchange followed its fall on Monday, falling by almost 6 percent, as early as Tuesday.
This time, the fall is due to the fall in Wall Street stock.
This is also reflected in the market reaction to the result of the US House of Representatives vote, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the financial sector there.
The fall in stocks in Asia
Asian stocks fell dramatically on Tuesday, although indexes did eventually erase some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell almost 4 percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with Shanghai markets closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5 percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market, according to the Taiwan stock index, is down 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world", noted Hong Kong's chief monetary officer, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are on par with the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table and pass a proposal to support the financial system, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise, they fear the impact will spread to other countries.
The bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system that would have cost up to $700 billion.
So lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indexes recording their biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by nearly seven percent, and a similar drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but once it turned out that the bill had failed in the House, the index found itself in free fall.
Congress backed down: the US government can pump $700 billion into the banks
The highest officials of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial aid agreement for the US financial system.
The vote on it will be early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve a $700 billion bailout for the U.S. financial system.
But it's not over yet.
Congressmen must finalize some details of the agreement before they can release the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The financial support plan will be debated on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported to Reuters by the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank.
Sources say the Senate could vote on the plan as early as Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then there is a 'sweetening' due to the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
The plan must be effective.
"We have made great progress.
We've resolved our differences about what the market stabilization package should look like", Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
She thinks the final vote could be on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalize the government's fund.
It should buy back from financial companies unsold mortgage assets which are causing financial companies to incur heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
There's still a lot of work to do in the recovery plan, but I think we're there", Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to get a final deal through Congress by Sunday.
They're trying to reassure investors that trading in Asian financial markets is the first time in a long timeframe that a congressional decision could affect Monday's trading.
It is not yet clear, however, when both houses of the US Congress will vote on the bill, or whether they can't suspend talks on any last-minute issues.
Lawmakers are hoping to get it approved in the next few days.
However, the law will be subject to a number of changes.
The total amount of aid for the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not doing its job, in the wake of the next $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress in the negotiations
The President may veto this decision, but Congress may override it.
But despite these changes, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities that had fallen in value because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, remained.
"We worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
Even President Bush is pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restrictions on gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said the lawmakers agreed on the responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the relief, timing the plan's financing.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the participating companies and establish a committee to oversee the fund.
He should run the Treasury Department.
"We've worked very hard on this and we've made great progress toward a deal that will work and be beneficial to the market and to all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who are having trouble paying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on the mortgages it buys, in order to reduce the monthly installment costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Mark, chief economist of Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"That's because it's not known by what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets will be redeemed.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will share losses", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week, Mark says it's not that important.
"Much more importantly, this week, congressmen must agree to support this plan and to ratify it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement to be approved is the most important at this time,' Marek stressed.
A knife fight between MP3 players and cell phones.
We'll tell you how to choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems obvious that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons to get a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the demands of the future owner.
You're probably not going to be able to get a high-end, expensive record player at home to play the latest Maxim Turbulence album.
First, such musical products do not appear on LP records and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
But if you have art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl on your shelves, you probably have never dreamed of such a record.
It's the same with music on the road, so compressed music, simply, MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories here too.
It may be unacceptable for someone to spend eight thousand crowns on a record player, just as it may be difficult for a Pink Floyd fan to chew on a twenty-crown headset from the market.
Two extremes, between which there's plenty of room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life
Some of the best music players can do a lot more than just play music, but most cell phones can't.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a better camera, a worse one, and maybe even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone has its disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy drains.
Few phones can play music for more than 10 or 12 hours, but most of them can play much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
So with cheap phones, expect them to play for no more than a few hours.
If you're still making calls, get another charger at work just in case - even for more expensive devices.
You won't have that problem with MP3 players, even the worst ones will last at least nine hours of continuous playback on a single charge.
Another problem is when you record music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to a memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without reducing the amount.
You don't need any special software for the iPod.
Just fill it with music via a USB drive from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already have their own music library sorted by artist name, album name, genre, or even user rating.
Some devices only display a directory tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones are better
When choosing a particular device, consider in particular the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of operation.
If music is your main hobby and you listen to it for a short time every day, for example on the tram, you can just use any MP3 player on your phone.
Which is actually what almost any phone can do.
You don't even have to look too closely at what music formats your phone or your music player can do.
MP3s can handle everything, and the vast majority of the music that you get is going to be in that format.
It is one of the most widely used and, in addition, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
All you have to do is visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service alone could be a strong argument for the purchase of a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the network's offerings are meager and mostly limited to fast-paced radio hits.
The prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally expected that this method of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you get the urge to listen to something, you grab your phone in your pocket while your MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
It also depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wired handsfree.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music phones is that they're going to cost a lot.
The cheapest ones are usually under three grand.
For three or four thousand crowns you can already get a very decent walkman.
But most of the time, you're going to be limited by the absence of an outlet for your regular headphones.
The best and most technically-equipped phones, even with a 3.5mm headphone jack, cost up to 15,000.
The advantage of players is that they are easy to use.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be mastered by anyone.
The minimal functionality, the similarity of the control to a previously common cassette player or perhaps a phonograph is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of accidentally switched on mobile internet and subsequent huge data transfer bill.
What device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the corresponding card, you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy another cheap MP3 player, go to CowOne, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgetton, or Iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to spend more than 1 100 CZK.
If you are a more demanding listener, you might want to reach for specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3s, and thus the user's comfort is close to that of a separate MP3 player.
The next largest is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The same service and in the same price category up to CZK 4,000, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum), you will be taken away by the MP3 players from the aforementioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I should .
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fairly mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European counterparts.
Still, we're missing something here -- a virtual operator that could make the classic ones go down.
Maybe he won't be gone long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the CCCME, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in the USA than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission's recent steps in the field of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation may arise: for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that's really willing to fight.
It may sound paradoxical, but we have three cell networks and penetration is well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to take advantage of the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has repeatedly stated in the past that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, often reminds them of this.
It is probably true that a traditional operator with its own network probably has no chance (otherwise, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a significant price reduction, to which the traditional operators also had to respond.
And before the likes of Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile came on the market, there were voices in the UK that sounded like ours.
But it turns out that there is a place for such operators, and they can be really successful.
Besides, we don't have to go far to get examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator managed to gain over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate efficiently, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In this world, virtual operators tend to be low-cost, offering cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
However, as Mobilking's example in Poland shows, betting on an untouched target group can be quite a good move.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"The right guys are going to pick Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust", says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual operator.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be applied here.
Vodafone's press spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings.'
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
It seems almost certain, however, that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region", said Jana Studničková, press spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
By doing so, it indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition.
GTS Novera has been hiding its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator for some time, and would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them", says Pavel Kaidl, the group's press spokesman.
Maybe it's a sign of things to come.
From unofficial information, it seems that we should see the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its emergence is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the emergence of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been contacted by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area", said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonica O2 in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2: 'We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further.'
He adds: "T-Mobile's network is unlikely to have a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point we should have a concrete agreement on the table to be able to think in this short term".
Vodafone is focusing more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
That's what we consider most beneficial from a customer perspective.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile internet.'
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The behaviour of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
Why facilitate the entry of such a competitor?
The fact that operators can pull together when something is at stake is also shown by the pulling around the invention of the U:phone.
Perhaps the biggest push for the CTU came at the time of the invention of the U:phone by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the CTBT website.
Now, U:fon is a good argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemr pointed out: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on it and, above all, on its services.'
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is quite striking.
This is not just the CMO's position, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere with competition.
They belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPCW).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a contract had been concluded between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not sufficiently attractive for traditional operators,' said Kristián Chalupa from the external relations department of the OHIM in response to our inquiry.
I don't think that's surprising from the operators' representatives.
This is more than a compliment from an authority which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, as Kristián Chalupa adds: 'In foreign countries where virtual operators are common, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of mobile phone prices.'
However, it is clear that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not in the interests of the EIA.
What's really shocking about this whole case is the touching agreement between the three mobile operators that emerges from their responses.
The question of whether it's really just a coincidence is a self-imposed one.
Like the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is surely a product of chance and fierce competition.
'The Authority has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore no corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market.
The telecoms regulator is also likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile market to virtual operators,' said Chalupa.
The interpretation of a dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention.
Understandably, there is an analysis of the relevant markets by the OCTs which considers that telecommunications is the only market from a competitive point of view.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always required to establish a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator -- it's quite logical -- has a monopoly on its network.
So it has to be dominant in a certain segment.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to the ETS that the three mobile operators are behaving in a strikingly similar way.
However, the complaints of several interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all operators.
In telecommunications, blaming the CTU is a fairly common trick by which the ETS takes matters into its own hands.
We've met him on several similar occasions.
Unfortunately, until the recent amendment of the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CTO's powers to the area of competition in telecommunications had not been implemented, although a number of experts had since promised to improve the situation.
The CSU agents must know better than that, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's what happens when no one's watching
The operation of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are quite a few in the Czech mobile networks, goes unnoticed.
They are companies that publish their own mobile phone price lists, but they are only partially public.
This is because they are usually multi-level marketing companies.
It offers its own mobile phone services, such as Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies usually only get to the chosen few.
The magic is that the company acts towards the operator like a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, it will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial terms of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If the cases you mention occur, they could be breaches of contract that we would deal with and could result in termination of the cooperation with the company in question", Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that such activity would not have been reported to the responsible people of the mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators object to such a procedure.
The fact that they make significant profits from their activities does not jeopardise their official marketing, unlike real virtual operators.
Miroslav Čepický points out the potential problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name and therefore cannot have it at their disposal as regular mobile operator customers.'
But that's what should be the least weird.
In addition, a further question for the EEAS is raised.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to this kind of thing, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that OHIM has a rather strong power to detect such activities and, if it does not wish to, it cannot be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they were unaware of such activities and that their business conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has been repeatedly stated in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a marked drop in the prices of services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual operators have been established, the traditional operators have tried to prevent them from being established to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments used were virtually identical - too small, too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in developed countries, it was at this time that regulators stepped in, protecting not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they succeeded in creating the first virtual operator and enabling others to follow suit.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing this whole case away like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot help feeling that the ambiguity of competence is more than useful in these cases.
But let's not throw a coin at the pot.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really does appear soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators has allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it is difficult for the OHIM to remain indifferent to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And we might stop calling it a raft than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Pick the best one
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech State Day, solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral performance and instrumental version.
The singing was performed by Katerina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlavek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen a singer with young representative voices, who are distinctive and popular, to sing solo versions.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and then the congregation, had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were in agreement", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where is my home was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovsky Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyla, with music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously adopted it.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the "new" anthem?
Prague MHD on Wednesday for the first time even on a chip
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic ticket in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
It can now be purchased by about 100,000 people who own an Opencard chip.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and a yearly coupon (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it uploaded to their chip card at the information centres and workplaces of the Transport Enterprise at the underground stations Museum, Mostek, Holešovice Station, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
By the afternoon, over 400 customers had used the service.
Those who start using the Internet can forget forever about the ticket counters in subway stations, where they have regularly had to stand in long lines for paper tickets.
They buy the voucher online and upload it to their Opencard at one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"These places offer passengers a barrier with trained staff who help them with online shopping and also upload the purchased coupon to their card", said Martin Opatrný, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to download electronic Opencard coupons from self-service ATMs in several metro halls.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, resembling ticket markers, and passengers may have noticed them at the metro stations of Rozty, Budějovská, I. P. Pavlov, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five in the city now, but by the end of the year there should be 80", added Opatrný.
The coupon checks the driver's seat
Operating the vending machines, which start tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert an Opencard chip card into the card and the prepaid coupon will automatically upload to it.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
This is the case for the suburban trains and bus lines numbered 300 to 499, which mainly serve the inhabitants of the Central Bohemian municipalities.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport system, the guides are equipped with card readers that allow them to check the validity of the coupons for both time and bandwidth", explained ticket control Filip Drapal of Ropid, an organisation that compiles Prague's public transport timetables.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's cash register.
The driver must not only show the chip card at the check-in, but also attach the Opencard to the designated spot on the side of the ticket office.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the downloaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of a downloaded coupon, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information", added the Grappler.
Passengers who do not travel by bus and do not remember when their voucher expires can go back to the ATM where vouchers are loaded onto the card.
Here, information on the validity of their documents is displayed on the instrument display.
The Sudetenland wanted a referendum on the United States.
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 requested the incorporation of the Shumava into the United States.
It's from a letter that's in the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
In 1945, a group of Sudeten Germans reportedly appealed to the president of the United States with this request.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that was kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov are asking the American president in a letter not to allow the return of the "Sumav County" - taken by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be really sure in words that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", reads the letter, signed "People who care about the fate of the Schumacher".
Since annexation to Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to take over the Šumava protectorate for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that you, despite the opinion of a quarter of a million people, would give this territory to some foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and has done nothing but contribute to the Allied victory", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is fear of the vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States was supposed to doubt the thinking of the Schumacher Germans, all he had to do was to hold a referendum in Schumacher County on whether its citizens wanted to become part of the United States or live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, some scholars say it aptly reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have had at least a hint that it would be their expulsion from the republic, few of them even considered such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Český Budějovice.
He was a German builder during the war, stationed in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would need Czech", said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living in pre-war Czechoslovakia, he said, expected to be deported from the republic on the basis of the Benes decrees.
You don't think you're going to pay!
The emotional campaign attacks the drivers
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
That's what the Ministry of Transport is going to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will be on TV, radio, in theaters, on the Internet, and on flyers.
It's supposed to discourage speeding and drinking.
And also remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
It is aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the spoons?
Mostly human stories that attack emotion.
And the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign is a testament to that:
You don't think you're going to pay!
The word "don't" is written in large letters on the label.
And in the pool of blood, there's the word "you'll pay".
It is meant to symbolize that a person may pay with his life for a moment's carelessness.
The spot will continue to "terrify" audiences until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to see images of the victims of accidents.
He promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whips for the driver
"The driver is subject to a system of sugar and whips.
The sugar for them is that if they go on the red light, for example, they save time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk", says Martin Korán, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
That is why press campaigns are needed, and especially negative advertising, says a psychologist.
He says signs that warn drivers of danger are less effective.
"If a static warning sign is installed, it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and distract drivers", warned the Koran.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the interim Israeli government, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published Monday in the Jedi daily Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) because without that there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially doesn't want to have their feet torn by tractors or bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to two July attacks in the city that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" that lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work", he continued.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which he said was a necessary condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan", he pointed out.
"The Syrians know what they have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up their continued support for Hamas terrorism, Al-Qaeda terrorism and jihad in Iraq,' the prime minister said.
Question after the accident: are the bus stewards illegal?
They don't know the law, they can't ride long-distance buses
In the wake of the tragic accident involving a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether the stewards and passengers could move on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activity is contrary to the Road Traffic Act", says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was apparently caused by a truck driver crossing the road with a bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe seat in the car, although she has two other seats reserved.
However, the bus may crash or brake sharply even while the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The issue is whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical certificate.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have parking spaces; which was confirmed by Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"We discussed this with the Ministry and at first the passengers were not allowed to move.
It was later withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seat,' he said.
The steward doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal definition of the steward's role - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the term 'vehicle driver'; it does not define his rights and obligations,' adds Hanzelka, a spokesman for the company.
On the other hand, the director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law adequately addresses the issue.
'It depends on whether the bus has approved parking spaces.
That's the end of it", he says.
Buses are divided into urban with stops and restricted maximum speed, intercity with stops with higher speed and long-distance with no stops with maximum speed and seats fitted with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see a major problem in the movement of the flight attendants on board the bus.
"There are few dangers in a smooth ride, like servicing an airplane.
Even here, you can't tell when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant could hit her head".
"But if the bus brakes violently, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be dealt with by the carriers by internal regulations", he says, adding that the issue remains unresolved from the legal point of view.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers flight attendants as the only bus operator.
He's got 200 of them.
Even after the accident, the director doesn't consider their profession risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of steward is risky, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers are available for passengers on board.
It would also save money", he says.
The absence of stewards in his vehicles was justified by safety concerns by the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, which operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There has been a terrible tragedy.
A young flight attendant from Plzeň, who had worked for the company for two years, died in a crash on the Naples line.
The Slovenian truck probably veered off the cross-track without using the steering wheel and blocked the bus' path.
His driver tried to dodge him with a sharp maneuver, but he lost the right front.
The two resting places reserved for the stewards are not to be sold.
"These seats are not reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked".
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the court to decide, but it'll expect financial compensation from the culprit.
Amend the law?
♪ In the blink of an eye ♪
The move of the stewards on board the bus could be improved by a law that has been in the works for over a year by a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"But she has not come to any concrete conclusion.
Buses don't really solve much, but rather the points system, maximum speed on the motorway and using a mobile phone while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers", Hanzelka's spokesman concludes, saying that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board to its employees is full of big words.
The merger of the Düsseldorf-based financial institution with Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank will create "the central institution of the financial group, the Sparenbank, for trading on capital markets", according to a letter made public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will include in this transaction a 'set of competencies' that will ensure long-term returns.
In any event, such a merger could be a decisive impetus for further mergers in the land banking sector.
Such texts are produced when the board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, whose message to the Land government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find solutions for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which is well known to its savings customers for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its nature, has been discussed for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
When presenting the half-yearly results at the end of August, Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas was quoted as saying that he did not see the need to merge his Mainzer Landstraße bank with one of the Landesbanks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is half a Land bank and half a savings bank, has entrusted the management board with the task of conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be a capital market transaction or part thereof.
But the talks have only just begun, finance officials say.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers on the Frankfurt financial market, is not mentioned for the first time in connection with the consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that a merger could take place between Deka-Bank, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
The trio was finally nothing.
The Commission notes that the Hessen Land Government did not provide any evidence that the Hessen Land Government had been involved in the merger.
Neither did the other two bank houses.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead acquired by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, there was repeated speculation about the merger of Deka-Bank with the Land banks.
However, recently, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, has expressed his disapproval of speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, independently of this, there seems to be a growing conviction that the convergence of the various public sector banking houses is a necessity.
The first thing to be seen after the Bavarian parliamentary elections is the merger of BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not good news for Helab.
If the pressure to merge further increases, it gradually loses potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, it would be second fiddle, even though it has faced the financial crisis far better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the merger with WestLB was also banned by the Association of Savings and Loan Banks of Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 per cent stake in Helab.
Nord LB would be the most likely candidate.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how well the business models of individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Association of Savings Banks and Gross Banks had not yet answered the crucial question of which business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the regional banks.
It could also lead to the break-up of WestLB, which is not the wish of anyone at this institution.
Therefore, the letter from the board of directors of the bank also mentions that it is trying to find a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how this can be linked to the linking of individual components with Deka-Bank will be seen in time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "Italy Weekend".
It's Elena's first time, Luc's third or fourth.
But this time, Elena will be his girlfriend, and everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the Kaiser five-litre barrel, stands a stronger beard, demonstrating to 200 tourists at the Oktoberfest how deep the tones of his throat can be.
Elena slaps Luca and then she kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus station next to Puorta Nuova, four buses will leave tonight at 11:45 p.m. with the sign "Destination Monaco, festa della birra", expected to arrive at 6:30.
Three buses are mostly Italian, one bus is exclusively Brazilian.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And this loud, says Marco Guarda, is nothing for Italy.
Marc, who wears a long fur coat with a fake leather sole and glasses with wide silver rings, owns the three buses.
He's been riding with them for five years, and this year alone he's organized three expeditions.
Night there, day between the beer stands, 10:30 p.m. departure back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast of Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to Bavarian beer purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave late at night, on the highway to the "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus quickly goes silent, the passengers sleep.
They're doing well, they'll need their strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where it makes one more stop on the motorway number 8 just outside Munich and a lot of other buses with Italian license plates.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 7:30 a.m., as scheduled, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is giving a final speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on a yellow hat.
It has "Oktoberfest" written on the left side in Swabian, next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" Marco calls out into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and take your seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so as not to interfere, and not all yellow hats on the same bench, spread out in the space!"
The oil is 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip, you know.
"Show the security guys we're being decent.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Be back here tonight at exactly half past eleven!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, the beer tent area.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as badges on trees, signs, and even on the election poster of one of the major Bavarian parties.
We must prepare for retreat.
It's known as the "Italy Weekend" the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Exact numbers of visitors are not available; there are speculations of 50,000 making their way across the Alps and breaking into beer tents, with 10 percent of all visitors this weekend reportedly arriving from Italy.
The Munich police force will be reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics, in which Italians are in first place ahead of the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments.
Of particular interest to Italians is the Hofbräu tent.
A sleepless night for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
Just last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and that he also included in his statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis.
Because it happened last weekend.
The Dax index finance house Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which specialises in real estate financing, will receive a multi-billion loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance would amount to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only have to pay interest on the amount actually spent.
The money is said to come from both private and public banks.
In the background, the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to the newspaper, this state financier refinanced the long-term projects for which he lent money in an extremely short time, which is now impossible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve ratio shrank by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and the equity ratio also decreased slightly from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current and net proceeds from financial transactions decreased to zero compared to the previous year, while proceeds from the increase in the value of receivables and certain securities, as well as from the cancellation of the credit provisions, decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only higher revenues from the compensation for the subsequent settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the remuneration of interest under the tax code and from the business of intermediation for the group companies made the 16 per cent decrease in revenues even more moderate.
The former state financier burned out on business loans after its privatisation in 1990, which were then spun off from the services portfolio and run by Aareal Bank.
Since the traditional state funding was too low-yielding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint private-public-public partnerships (PPPs) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write off some of the value of its subsidiary, and these write-offs will have a 'substantial material effect' on the calculation of the group's profit and loss, as some have been vague about.
The fact is, there's no dividend.
It was already cut by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depfa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the interbank lending stream has practically dried up because banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing annually for part of the Depp loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the loan covers the group's financial need for the foreseeable future and protects the company 'from the influence of the international money markets, which are currently largely incapable of functioning'.
Other sources have suggested that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE's Chairman Georg Funke stated that Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in the near future.
The Bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the competitiveness of Hypo Real Estate on the market is now assured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and the unattainable nature of the crisis, there's probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely impossible that the loan should not be fully exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank appeared to be on the verge of bankruptcy late Sunday afternoon, even a preliminary bailout cannot appease the passions.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond prices were holding up well.
While preferential debt has practically not moved, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This concerns in particular the bonds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and, logically, the bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be understood in relation to the stability of the international financial system following the sharp intensification of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought them into the firm by taking over Depfa.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, the securities can be expected to be redeemed at maturity.
But it could also be that, in a way that few people dare to hope for today, the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability now bordering on certainty has become a mere legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare long-term creditors for a series of sleepless nights when they decide whether to waive their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the cut-off line at least to construct a transfer of losses from previous financial years to exchange rate returns from later years for the purpose of future capital gains tax payments.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is introduced to her first day at high school in Tachibana, the girls start to chat: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana has been using the word since she read manga, and she writes about Japan on her new exchange blog.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already chased on the way to school.
I live in the suburbs of Tokyo, on the way to Kawasaki, and I'm a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way myself, but I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin meeting after 8:00 a.m. and a short session with the teacher, called the 'home room,' begins twenty minutes before 9:00 a.m.
But before class started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet worn a school uniform, I put on my host mother's old skirt, with the blouse, blue knee pads, and black leather boots.
So dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayónara Wo še Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was so happy that I had started learning the language two years earlier.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering and giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I knew that from my manga.
It is a basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly swam into my seat.
The girl next to me was smiling pretty wide, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I was literally overwhelmed.
They talked to each other and giggled and asked me the possible and the impossible - and it's really hard to understand Japanese in English.
Then, at halftime, everybody unpacked their tapes.
My host mom made me a lunch box, too - and that's not the same as boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little steaks, pickled lettuce and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu paste.
I don't know what I eat in Japan.
These things look and taste strange, and they're all new.
The thing is, everything is really good.
Well, except for the salted plums, br!
Benta in Japanese schools are not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl will give a boy a homemade bento, which in this case is specially artfully decorated, hoping to get to know the boy more during the breakfast break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Cause I'm just fascinated by it.
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning a little bit of Japanese.
So it was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly prized here.
Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends, but it is also strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen".
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings, too.
But how would we know if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
For several years now, the online magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions from prominent scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has been able to prove, if we can't prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But once we start to look at another species and open up the question of perception or consciousness in general, we're entering a difficult terrain because the hardware doesn't fit.
When a rat is in danger, it will do what many other animals do: pretend to be dead, run away, or attack.
People behave similarly, which some scientists conclude is a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to translate our subjective experience into animal experience.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that humans are different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie hidden in the linguistic nature of man: because so much of his perception is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if language did not matter, it would certainly be affected by language, so animal consciousness, whatever its construction, would probably differ from most states of consciousness in humans.
That's why it's difficult to know what consciousness might look like in other animals.
When something is intrinsic and subjective, and it cannot be measured or analyzed, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, it puts us in a great problem to explore it.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
It would be possible to study the processes in the mind of animals regardless of their content, and that's exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially in the case of visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick have been working on, focuses more on neural correlates of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: they may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the neofrontal cortex for visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I derive them from the fact that an emotional system, like the fear system, is activated in the brain by conscious activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we're in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) uses operational memory.
So, from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex that are characteristic of primates, and especially humans.
In connection with the nature of language, there is a subtle gradation of perception, because with words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states so that we can attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in areas of the cortex and brain stem that are devoted to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could easily share the senses perceived by multiple animal species.
I can't argue with that, but I find it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what we see as fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt by both organisms in the same way: But how can we verify, Pankseep continues, that rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach fleeing danger - does it also feel fear?
In my view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the similarity of experience.
It's true that neural comparisons take us further: rats and humans have similar brain stem, whereas cockroaches have no brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for the feelings?
And even if we could prove it in humans, how would we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't really know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'd rather study emotional behavior than rat emotional perception.
Anyway, we can see progress at the neural level in this case if we measure the same in rats and humans.
I don't study language and consciousness, nor do I study feelings, because I don't know if they exist.
It may seem short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than slam myself against a wall repeatedly.
I'm a practical emotional writer.
UEFA President Platini: The deadline for mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland", Vasjunyk said.
"But for our country, it is not amnesty.
The work has only just begun, and there is much to be done in both countries".
In early completion of the construction or reconstruction schedule of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are faltering.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work as fast as possible now", said the chairman of the Ukrainian Federation Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time".
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The management of the Polish PZPN was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by an independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee was convened at the request of Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules", Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We have written to UEFA President Michel Platini assuring him that this step will not lead to the preparation for the 2012 European Championship".
Several teams from the top league were only last season sentenced to forced relegation due to manipulation, eventually even having to move the start of the league quickly.
Angry Dennis Quaid is back in action
She wanted to advertise a new movie, she talked about personal things in an interview, and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has spoken of her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He's furious and he's hitting back.
The delayed war of roses of former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, these two Hollywood actors are locked in a bitter feud - in the public eye.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for her marriage's collapse: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful".
She said she didn't find out about the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The inspiration for this mental strip was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his portrayal as an unfaithful husband was significant: "It's crazy", the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "Meg is repeatedly chewing on the history of our relationship and making adjustments".
Moreover, it is "unfortunate" that their 16-year-old son, Jack, is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently fathered twins.
He concludes his reflection on avoidance: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family that is doing great".
Tickets and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodations have fallen again, according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, following a price increase in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared with 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express blames the weak dollar for this trend, which has caused "a declining appetite among American tourists".
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centres more than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices even set a European record, rising by 26.3 percent.
The airline also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, economy class passengers had to pay on average 7,1% more than in 2007, and the cost of fuel for high-speed flights increased by 29,2%.
From April to June, Economy class prices fell by an average of 12,5% compared to the previous quarter, but the changes in perception were less pronounced in Business and First Class.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
They rose 11.9 percent from January to March, and fell 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the study cited above, prices were even cut in half.
One reason for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The tense situation is indicated by the cancellation of unprofitable routes by air carriers and by the high number of airlines which declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1-0
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still struggling to put together a functioning XI.
It was written by Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge the failed landing for Representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach came into the game late and failed with a puck-punched balloon.
His message was well-formulated and sounded convincing.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena's cabins.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the halftime was over, and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physical therapist for HSV for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many a one-time actor.
And so his request was also granted in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol added and raised his thumb to match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jola.
His order was probably the same: here with the second goal!
It didn't happen.
"Everything was not looking good here today", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wished it was more relaxed.
The Hamburger owe their 1-0 (1:0) victory to the leader Mladén Petríc (11th) and the fact that the very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty win", Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV is celebrating 121 years of existence this Monday.
So the audience celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the live updated scoreboard on the video booth, which featured their team as the winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the mid-table result symbolizes the league's unpredictability rather than its dominance of HSV.
With the late arrival of new players - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern's acquired Jansen - the team is slowly getting there, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling", Jol said emphatically.
After losing the vote
There's a lot of fear on Wall Street.
The initial reports of the bankruptcy of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to drop by 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in franchise history.
Dow gained some weight later.
At 8:30 p.m., this most important stock barometer in the world was down five percent to 10,579.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The worst was at Dow at this point, with American Express losing nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America losing about 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' stock has dropped nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, a big investor named Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
The rescue plan is to make available funds for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage paper.
However, the entire amount is not paid out at once but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive options on shares of financial companies, which could be redeemed in the event of a favourable exchange rate, thereby reducing the burden on the State budget.
Shares in Europe are falling sharply
The billions in aid to banks in Europe and the US do not clear investors.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is down sharply and the Dax index is pulling in.
The Dow Jones is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the government.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The shares of the aforementioned Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of their value, despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax has clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000 mark and has scored 5,839 points at a minus 3.7 percent.
Stock markets around the world have gone to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street started the day with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout may not be enough to revive the financial markets.
The Dow has lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of trading, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the bailout, the Senate could have a say on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges were also moving in one direction: in London the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2%, in Paris the CAC-40 lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAX, they lost Arcandor shares after the announcement of the capital increase.
The private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
The company also announced that it would not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called the swing-by maneuver.
Experts worry that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space.
Because of the fuel lines, which are about to freeze, she is now in danger of dying in the cold.
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon - gravitational slit anomalies.
Gravitational fallout is a flight maneuver by space probes to gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physics trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what has puzzled scientists for years in this case is that flying objects do not behave 100% as one would expect under the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes are accelerating or slowing down unexpectedly.
Physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named it gravitational-bar anomaly.
Some experts worry that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curving space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was right, and he is trying to explain the gravitational-gap anomaly by using so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe has been detected by astronomers.
"Dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth, could be responsible for this anomaly", he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It is evidently the source of gravitational force, the effect of which on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It is completely invisible, meaning that it neither emits nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that this dark matter makes up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the Italian foreign minister in Egypt has announced that the abducted tourists are free again.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in a shootout before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
I hear the ransom negotiations are already underway.
Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists lured to the Sahara seem to be free.
The Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media reported the same.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to the news of the release by the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health", Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition are apparently on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootout before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the abduction before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed the six hostages.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom", said the worker quoted.
He said it was "just a hostage situation" when he suddenly got "this surprise".
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers and captured two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, to be paid by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom, citing a German intermediary, said the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by stepfather "led to suicide"
Several years of abuse by stepfather led to a woman's suicide, a court case.
After pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual assault, 57-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly bound his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death", Trerise wrote in a confession.
It was also stated in court that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the '80s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But it was rumoured in court that Miss Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse committed twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006, friends of Miss Randle, who was also heavily involved in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and had "give up on life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It's believed she suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the case would probably never have come to trial".
"I would particularly like to emphasize the impact that, according to Stephanie's parents, your crime has had on their daughter over the years", he added.
"Obviously, otherwise she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman".
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the train at Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were obtained by the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It's the least serious offence against the law and there's no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC's Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said that such a move would come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry and the Government Office", he said.
An employee who cannot be named is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, which is a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police prosecute the officer on the basis of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he left behind included classified analysis of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was moved from his home to an undisclosed location.
The cooperative reserves face B&B debt
The British Co-operative Savings Bank may have to settle debts of over £80 million following the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be repaid by all the companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
The CEO of the BSA, Adrian Coles, said it was "disappointing" that the bonds and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion debt will eventually be paid off by the bailout of the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime will be paid back each year to all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme Fund for the BBC confirmed that all 59 co-operative deposits are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions that have been so considerate... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were far less considerate.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionately to the deposits it held, and that the deposit should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
That means the reserves will have to find £81 million to pay the interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, the CEO of the Trade Union Guarantee Association, told the BBC that he believes it's not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that were prudent during the boom in the housing market are now having to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent".
BSA says no backup has fallen since 1945 when they first appeared.
"We will have to look at all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options are available to protect the co-operative savings banks and their members from an account that could be substantial", Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest will be due for the whole year and could be almost double that.
Since the cooperative savings banks are joint-stock companies without shareholders, the account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk will be five pence a litre
The people of Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence a litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after the two pence increase in February, and it comes after research by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want the price increases to be reflected in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bail for ex-Bangladesh Prime Minister denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajida for bail, meaning that if she returns to her homeland, she could be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail over allegations that she had obtained over fifty million taka ($729,700) from a businessman by blackmail when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges against her.
Khalid Ziya, a long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local military-controlled government give her complete freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear from the terms of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she's now appealing the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Shaykh Hasina's request for bail on the grounds that she does not need bail as she is already undergoing an investigation abroad on a confession of honour", her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal the Supreme Court's order".
Her lawyers argued that she needed bail to return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December elections.
A senior official of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasina is to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-led interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to undergo medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalid Zia both deny all the charges against them.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children were excluded from the recent mass polio vaccination because of Taliban-related violence.
The UN has been running vaccinations in six provinces for the past week.
However, she says that for security reasons she could not reach the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spokesman said this was despite Taliban promises not to attack or impede thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB lost a court case over ITV
BSkyB lost a court case to review a decision of the Competition Commission ordering it to reduce its stake in competing broadcaster ITV.
The Commission therefore considers that the measure is compatible with the internal market.
The Commission has previously stated that BSkyB's shareholding distorted competition and gave the companies disproportionate influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired a stake in 2006 in a deal which consequently prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV and invited the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of the Virgin consortium, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer organisation and the regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - primarily because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to relinquish its voting rights.
The American lawyers' case is being re-investigated.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 firing of nine U.S. attorneys.
This came at a time when a report on the affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the actions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "Serious allegations including potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or explained".
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The controversy began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys from their positions in December 2006.
At the time, the Ministry said that the lawyers had been dismissed for poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissed lawyers were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers have been involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican lawmakers and senators, while others have refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
American lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases on behalf of the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Secretary Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for his firing and eventually resigned.
A number of other officials from the Justice Department also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he was "mainly responsible" for the dismissal, that he had "abdicated" from his leadership position and that he had "not been conspicuously involved".
Other officials, including former Bush senior adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf is getting one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be attending the special gold award ceremony next weekend in London, said he was "honored" by the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominees are led by Coldplay, who made the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand above things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them".
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals, which Meat Loaf provided.
It started with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell stayed on the charts for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has been plagued by health problems in recent years, including having heart arrhythmia surgery in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel his concerts.
It turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Shady streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways, and other land-based transportation, some famous, others merely useful.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley in the East Village leads north from First Street -- without going to Second Street -- between Bowers and Second Avenue.
At about ten feet wide and forty feet long, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic jam.
There's no street signs.
It's virtually invisible in a regular atlas.
But the alley has its admirers.
Avalon Bay, for example, is a developer of the recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants Extra Place re-paved and to create a cleaner corridor to the shops and boutiques that are to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were fascinated by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last remnants of the pre-cultured block.
But the city's Department of Conservation and Development, which has the street under its control, has no interest in keeping it.
At a meeting of the community land committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay outlined a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of Community 3, the committee prefers the option of keeping the streets in the hands of the city and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city has very little land left, and we'd like Extra Place to remain in its possession", she said.
"There could be suggestions for repairs and maintenance, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access".
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it was planning to redevelop the small street and set up a number of seating areas, some of which would be used by a café, which the developer expects to rent out the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this barren alley and make it a beautiful place for the public", she said, adding that the city had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, said the city was indeed looking to sell the street, and pointed out that his office's job is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door to Extra Place led to CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop for the cover photo of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing", says Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes".
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the upgrading of the East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling the Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, however modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - a nearly unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (subtitled "Lamentation Book: A Bitter Nostalgic View of a City in the Process of Dying"), posted a portion of the Extra Place story from the Talk About the City column that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead-end street, dark even in the daytime, and bordered by the slashed iron doors of the warehouses and the clogged windows where week-old newspapers are thrown in the gutters".
With a few exceptions, the alley looked exactly the same one night recently.
The rat ran through a dead end near the door that once led to the CBGB, where a high-end clothing store now stands.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to the fresh batch of discarded newspapers was an empty beer bottle.
A couple of passersby said they hardly ever think about Extra Place, but they suggested he could use a little spring.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thought some people underestimated the impact of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were in dark, damp, disgusting places".
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this edition of Focus on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the attitudes of candidates to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools".
Effectively reaching Hispanic voters is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's education agenda is just proof of that.
The Obama campaign points out that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", which is true.
To combat such performance gaps, Obama's education agenda specifically promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those just learning English.
The question remains, however, whether Barack Obama's commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes using languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance gaps.
Take Sixth Street Prep, for example, a charter elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are, in the vast majority of cases, Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are learning English.
Yet, in the 2008 state math tests, an incredible 100 percent of fourth graders scored at the top.
Almost as amazing as that, ninety-three percent of fourth graders scored the highest on the state tests in English language and literature.
This incredible achievement was achieved by a different method than Obama's preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of ability and an approach without excuses.
And then, and Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's approach to teaching English for those just learning is "full immersion".
The immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We've had tremendous success with one new student from Mexico -- after 12 months, you'd walk into a classroom and you wouldn't know who he was".
"It works", she declared, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of what other schools with large Hispanic and English-language student populations should look like?
The results the school is achieving should make the answer to this question self-evident, but his own party's educational agenda (the National Education Association is a long-time advocate of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education cloud the predictions of Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by saying that people should stop worrying about "English-only" laws.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your children speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to erase the disparity in performance, he should think carefully about the educational models that work, rather than mocking and trivializing them.
Oil plunges on renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even the U.S. financial-market bailout plan might not be able to revive the economy.
The price of oil futures fell in the morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange by up to 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than 20 dollars a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street and also by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a peak of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell earlier this month to nearly $90 a barrel, and then jumped back on the wave of huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congressional leadership announced that it had reached a deal over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
This report has been overshadowed by the recent concern that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing collapse, the government announced that Citigroup would buy the banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the raging weekend talks that led to the economic rescue plan "are proving incapable of reviving market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate markets has been highly uncertain", analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape infection.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread around the world, and especially to China".
The bank's analysts have cut their forecasts for next year as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth, and have cut their gasoline price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter broke the team record
After spending more time in the Jets' jersey than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the second quarter develop, where the Jets turned a scoreless game into a deadly drive.
"I've never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played their agonizing game against the grim clouds above.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles on a 12-yard touchdown run, perfectly foreshadowing an afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved a mile forward.
Favre sent Coles in for two more touchdowns in that quarter, including one that landed the cornerback, and another 10 seconds before halftime.
"It was nothing extraordinary", Favre said of all his passing to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We communicated well, no matter what people thought".
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a pass and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith has a second pass and he's got it.
Linebacker David Bowens has Warner on the fence.
The last ball drop, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the insanity, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When told that both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
A lot of points have fallen in a short period of time".
The first Gebreselassie to improve his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why he is considered by many to be the greatest long-distance runner of all time when he broke his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to run the 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
Winning the flat track in 2:03:59 he beat his previous time of 2:04:26 which he ran last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is really incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or at least is the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month Gebreselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon because he feared - perhaps too frightened in hindsight - that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - he won the Gebreselassie on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have focused on is the longer track, the marathon record for the past decade having fallen by more than two minutes since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break obviously got him up rather than down.
"I'm so happy", Gebreselassie told reporters, "I'm not going to be able to do it".
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little hesitant today, but everything was fine".
He has also been criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon peaks, relying on drivers as if it were a track race, and putting world records above the point of competition.
But this criticism can hardly diminish Gebreselassie's tremendous running qualities.
Maintained at the pace by four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached the half in a time of 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped, Gebreselassie was constantly being chased by two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
Just before three miles from the finish line in Gebreselassie, he took the last and ran out to Kwambai, who then finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, finished the year with the seventh fastest time in history at 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff from Great Britain.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon last spring in a time of 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin, and in the third marathon she's ever run, she improved her personal best by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully, letting four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run a good lead and then overtaking them at about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askalefa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The Pride and Obstacles of Separate City Black Life
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from all that glitters, noises and swells, lies a quiet city that brings to life the pride and the hardships of African-American life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of hay, two schools, and no prisons".
It's a pilgrimage site now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Eatonville Dawn! Festival to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a side note, even though it has become a tourist destination by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with the white man, who "knows so little about us that he does not know what he is missing".
Even today, in a year when black presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama is calling for an open debate on race, many here remain wary of the views of outsiders.
"We are very careful about how our story is told", says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It has to be right".
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It's both a historical model of black upward mobility, and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It's a center of literature, but it's also a shadowy example of the Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that emerged from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the people here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about the Eatonville idea really didn't start until Zora, which is the only way Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt, tongue-in-cheek books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraph Florida tourist guide has turned the city into a little bit of Route 17, which leads through the often-overlooked center of Florida, into a stage for black history and human drama.
With a big bang in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road", she wrote, "is a white-brown, modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playground, always tended by Howard Miller, though he cannot read or write very well".
She also mentioned Dash's widow's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything else that fits in the hotel's watch".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This was obviously not your typical Fodor's publishing house.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"She told it like it was", says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, a member of the Johnson Girls, who Hurston made immortal by quoting men who sang silly songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it", she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a cyborg freak who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that most of the time when she arrived in town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on its modesty.
Most of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many were disgusted.
"People have always liked to see the dawn", said Franklin.
But, he added, swinging from a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
It seemed Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, had forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived before.
There was no major mourning ceremony or major public reading in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood her importance to the world or her legacy at all", said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography, Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to extend the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, the local two-lane highway.
The Orlando split has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult historical period.
The forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at people who were sitting on the side", Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady here who was killed by it.
They threw a melon out of the car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and declared its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "offensive rather than celebratory to my race".
Residents now argue that the desegregation of schools, while positive in some areas, has reduced Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the morale of the local youth.
"Black children were used to hugging - I remember it - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening", said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't hug your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier", said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Dawn Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with light-hearted self-esteem and quotes like "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand that".
In 1975, Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a highly praised biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared on bookshelves, re-entering the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again finding the light of day.
The Hurstons' former neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to their highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived for the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to celebrate.
The state backed down from the highway project after a few years.
"The five streams of the highway have revived, you would say, a real sense of civic pride", said Nathiri.
Boyd said it more simply, "The dawn saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the local church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and redecorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes seem like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, it is 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to seek the history and significance of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission is required for most interviews, and certain things - such as murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by white people and depicting blacks in fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, the brave, confident teacher who likes to eat red, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as the Hurston Festival grew, so did the pride of home.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled and so on, but not better, not worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, silly and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, sounds like a sincere love for the village as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for local government or the police, which he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, like the 11-year-old twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they pass by, think, 'Hmm, this town is nothing against the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently after church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment into history, it's a very nice city".
Here in New York we all speak fluent financials
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the stained-glass beehive of offices above their heads, every day the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City have the worst "bad day at the office" since the crash of 1929.
The messengers are still hauling metal trolleys down the sidewalks and carrying muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
The Spaniards keep moving between the towers, wearing, like human mules, fifty-fifty iron shirts hanging from the pendants on their backs.
Office rats are still lining up at street food stalls for their morning bagels, and it's still impossible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on a Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task to cover a late afternoon nap at my local J.P. Morgan Chase office, there were already about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of the cash registers to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where senior customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's, and new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason I did.
But by my time, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrift shops (similar to building societies), money associations and those types of savings banks that operate in only one state and claim to care for their customers like a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly failed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, was trying to find a buyer to bail it out.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me and feared another collapse were moving their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that does most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned financial fluency in the last week.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket was on the phone, talking to Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and its thin CEO, Dick Fuld, with a familiarity that was like she was taunting a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, 50-something housekeeper in my apartment, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said: "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I've moved it, I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing crackdown
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-wing Free Party, and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration presented by the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry signs similar to traffic signs, which show mosques crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were severely damaged between Friday night and this morning and police believe it was an organized act.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists who hate Muslim immigrants.
It's unclear if this incident was in any way connected to the election.
A spokesman for the Muslim community there said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration, which came as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan drew to a close.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering a cycle of self-searching after the right-wing shift in last week's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which collectively won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, have been vigorously campaigning against immigration, and some of their slogans have been criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headscarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which positioned the far right as the most powerful political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to go on a trip overseas.
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he planned to travel via France to Spain.
Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence of Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, under his real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Court of Common Pleas in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the judiciary said: "On Thursday 25 September, Kent Police applied to Ashford Court of First Instance for an order to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally involved".
64-year-old Glitter has informed authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, as he is making a record of sexual assault.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also give the police the planned departure date a week in advance.
If he neglected to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced they will not be investigating individual cases of Glitter's possible travels around the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to track someone who stays in the UK because we have extensive systems here that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent residents is a top priority for Kent Police, and we are working diligently to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders to minimize any danger to the public".
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not let him pass passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
He was also refused entry by Chinese authorities and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court of Criminal Appeal in West London, and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully sought an order that he be registered as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed for four months in the UK for possession of child pornography.
A source at the Interior Department said Jacqui Smith, the Interior Secretary, is calm and happy that Glitter has been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off stage". Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes. I'm not going to be a cop.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from the focus on interpretation - only then will I achieve a relaxed expression of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The second one is a human.
Inseparable, let alone private, in those moments away from the audience - when you can see the intimate gesture, the depth of the eye that is caught or the passionate gesture of the hands that are carefree because they are not going to come out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates the theatrical nature of the flamenco-people with the singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known faces of the masters.
With this in mind, the photographer is compiling a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, held as part of the monthly programme of flamenco photography (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco", says the author, explaining that the "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will see that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage and completely captivate the audience.
You don't have to be on stage to capture the personalities of these artists.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
Fascinated by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers for the record camera.
These are portraits that, by choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means contradicts the classical basis of the image and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea that according to Bauer himself reflects flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and develop".
What draws the audience is not the effect of the dance, the singing, or the play itself, but the personality and character of the performer.
The search for the moment in which we encounter the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perceiving, being and experiencing, has been and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
This selection of almost 70 photographed artists is made up of well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon be published in book form, with the portraits on display.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to the idea of repeating it in the "Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to get to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment, whether it is longer or just short - that is my passion.
I think in photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities that you don't even know, or who give you just a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer I always try to make my imaginations come true".
A collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galerie El Fotómata at 20 de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa has admitted that the novel he's writing is "a blunder"
Set in an environment he has yet to experience and telling of events unknown to him, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to succeed in his new project - he is currently working on a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and has also travelled in the Amazon.
The perennial favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the project he is currently working on is "a boldness" and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it one day", he concluded his speech at a festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that over four days saw the city aqueduct around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third annual Word Festival and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, winner of the Hay Festival's prize for best writer - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Rome presenting it, he had before him a devoted audience, for whom the hour of time had passed like water - the Peruvian recalled with amazing precision and a noteworthy dose of humor how from the original "incredible adventure" from the "pleasure of an avid reader" and from "the power to live more than I have lived" a literary mission was born; how he compensates for "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", meticulously sorting, correcting and rewriting the text; or how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his writing and what "memorial images" are the foundation of his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to know whether and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is merely entertainment, a fleeting experience", Vargas Llosa stressed, saying that "people are affected" and "the aim is to try to break the rules", and urged writers to "not succumb to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their mission.
The weather is causing the party to lose its place in the sky.
The lance performance that concludes the celebration in Pozoblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers was confirmed that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez, decided to cancel the bullfights.
The festival has been plagued by bad weather for so long that two of the three events have been canceled.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second planned bullfight.
During these, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to face the bulls in the arena of Castilblanca.
But this was only celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was awarded a shoulder for his dynamic and aesthetically pleasing performance.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante traded two spear strikes for greetings and one ear, which earned him more from uncovered arena seats than from bullfighting.
Worse yet, El Juli, who walked through the bullring of Los Llanos unsalted and greasy.
In the second round of the breathless struggle, he was severely criticized by most of the audience.
They ran a check in Álava in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hashish.
Ten minutes to five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The authorities stop two people in a van and they get away.
A shipment of more than two tons of hashish is unstoppable.
According to the report of the Department of Interior of the Basque Government, the authorities pursued and detained one of the persons travelling in the van, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A. A. J.
The suspect was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of government documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit were conducting a road check on the N-1 in places where it crosses the border of the Armiñón urban district.
They were about to stop the van for a check, but the driver disobeyed instructions, accelerated violently and fled.
Officers immediately began to chase the car until it stopped at a curb a few miles away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled into the wooded area.
Ertzaintz officials eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish that the suspects were carrying, as revealed during a search of an Iveco Daily delivery.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drugs.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "smeared" and did not match the data given in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also charged with forging state documents.
The Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape, in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Detained A. A. J., 28 years old, was taken to the police station for the completion of the necessary formalities before further investigation is commenced.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested in Santa Barbara, California, this weekend for driving under the influence.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of the Montecito parking lot, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping on the gas, swerving back and forth with a loud rumbling, and trying to get out of the parking lot - she had broken her sunglasses several times while backing off".
A witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear moments after she stopped at a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because "she was afraid for Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented", so the authorities took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to be tested.
A police spokesman said the actress cooperated and an excessive amount of alcohol was subsequently ruled out, but "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was apparent to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and taken into custody at around 7pm, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU Association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The head of the IU and the MP for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former council member of the Youth and Sports Department of the Seville mayor, Francisca Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of acting in favor of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am too much of a federalist to do this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers", Llamazares suggested the negotiations the party will have to undertake in relation to the former member of the Seville city council.
However, the head of IU insisted that "transparency" is absolutely necessary in the case of investigating the illegal actions committed by Silva: "The IU has always fought for the maximum transparency in such matters".
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Sangre de mayo", an epic gamble by Garcia
José Luis Garci's Sangre de Mayo, inspired by Episodes from the National Past by Benito Pérez Galdós, brings to life the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around €15 million.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film to a large team of interpreters.
The two-and-a-half-hour film Blood of Flowers will be released in cinemas this Friday, and a four-hour TV series is planned for Telemadrid in the future.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garci, he claims that by making this film he has fulfilled his "childhood dream", thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to make a film for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to mark the bicentenary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer with the idea that the plot would be based on an episode of the national past.
The 15 million budget, fully funded by the Madrid provinces, is a "unique opportunity" for Garcia to create an environment with sets and costumes that reflect the image of "a shaky Spain that has been mistaken for a leader to fight for - the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
The director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support received for the films Ala triste or Goya's ghosts - almost twice as much as Bloody Flower - so he could not shoot some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he has worked for almost his entire film career.
The director of "Volver a empezar" (Starting Again) works as he is accustomed to - on stage with actors he usually auditions with before filming and does not cast because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the job of a director is to go to theaters and cinemas and see what is going on in the craft he is doing".
Many of the actors he chose for Blood of Flowers have appeared before his camera in a few different ways, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, who has four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year, Bloody Flower, Seven Tables of French Billiards and the latest selection, Blind Sunflowers, represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but he claims that "it is just coming".
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're only working for profit, so you're willing to make one more movie", explains Garci, who has been directing for over 30 years.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia
The Sevillian flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father Florenç Tórtola Ferrer and Andalusian mother Georgina Valencia Valenzuela, was born in Triana, and moved to London with her family when she was three.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dancing.
She lived a life of passion, she was a pioneer of women's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she fought to abolish the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanting to Isabella Bayona.
"I wanted to work with Peppa Gamboa, and she designed this character for me -- it seemed incredible".
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about capturing her soul.
The titles of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "butterfly dance" evoked a guajira or "snake dance" some tango.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance matched that aesthetic", she says.
The performance features two exceptional personalities: Miguel Vedda, who will sing Isabella in one performance, as in "La puerta abierta", and the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former pupil.
"Matilde is the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to work on my project, and it is a great honor".
The performance also features music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singing by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; drums by El Pájara, viola by Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actress Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of eternal guide of this kind of artists, who are primadas with everything and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place in her time in places as far away as India, the United States, or Russia, and also throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at one time, but no one knows her today, and even less appreciates her work", says Bayón.
The show starts today at 8:30 at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The book "Diary of a Newlywed" also closes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Newlywed Man" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the site where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennale of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
The "Triennale of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with the new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the renovation of the Nobel House Museum and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: One Sunbeam", which opened in May of this year and, after touring various provinces of Andalusia, is scheduled to move to New York at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered eight hundred copies of "Diary of a Newlywed Man" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue spreading awareness about the personality and work of one of the most world-famous Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman is not so much like itself
"Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No Evil", and under the weight of knowing that Newman is gone, reveals her uncomfortable vision of abandoned American cinema and America as a whole.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And that he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
He was a boy to everyone, though.
"Sometimes what one feels can't be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend", said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him".
No one was afraid he'd be ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and the father of the nation died at a particularly dark time of terrorism and financial markets, at a time when American self-esteem is at a low ebb, when people are desperately looking for reasons to be proud.
When times are tough and people have no virtues and only a handful of people you admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all of them, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from the Anti-Drug Addiction Foundation founded in honor of his firstborn son who died of an overdose to his own brand of homemade food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that has gone to great lengths to free itself from a suicidal food culture.
A storm of admiration has swept Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar winner, directed by Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The fox has put a pretty high bar on all of us", says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few people today who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman did - living a life of honesty and serious privacy away from the cameras.
That's not always easy, sometimes even impossible, in today's media jungle.
But fortunately, there are such people, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He was divorced once, and since then he's been married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who he's been faithful to, though he's certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a steak at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven that on earth there is a harmony between his daughters and admirers - not very common in America.
It has been said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of being a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist".
The imperfect Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us are eager for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 event, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're going to follow yesterday's race, I say no!
It was talked about as the perfect race, and in my judgment it was the worst I've ever been on.
It's such a bunch of nonsense that if I was the test taker, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's start at the beginning, one step at a time.
The nonsense starts with picking up a race number, which means you have to leave early.
That's not bad, but if you're going, give it everything (including the chip to prevent the runway from overcrowding).
No, you didn't.
Here you had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after standing in the appropriate line) - what a surprise! - they only had an S-size shirt (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small shirts because it's less fabric and they're cheaper?
Well, that's a trifle compared to what happened on race day.
Besides the fact that you had to go very early to get the chip and the front took over 15 minutes, you had to turn in the bag.
The waiting time was over 35 minutes, which is unimaginable at a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as you might expect, the race started and we hadn't even put our bags down, and once we did, the pick-up was a lot worse.
The wait was extended by 40 minutes by rain, leading to a general uprising and an attack on the cabin.
I believe 500 of us will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some of us, like me, will not show the correct time in the test results because of the chip they gave me, which I assume didn't give me the correct time of launch.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
So I guess we'll just have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual receptionist.
At the MIT conference on new technologies, Microsoft showed off another development in a new image recognition and human interaction system in the form of artificial intelligence -- not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a messenger that would move around the company's premises) and perceiving what he hears in a conversation.
With a camera and a face-recognition system, the "receptionist" can determine how many people are in the room, who they are - even what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
He can also sort the audience by conversation groups.
In the demo video, the receptionist notices a third person and understands that he is not part of the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's seeing anyone, and he tells her that he'll be with her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
That's very charming.
But of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, like a new version of the Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured that if computers had only the essentials, without the burden of commercial unnecessities, they'd be five times more powerful -- man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
A breakthrough, considering that Microsoft is adding new features and extras to Windows version by version.
A change of direction would be an act of merit.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came on the web, I became one of those who subscribed to the theory that it was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it's the necessary layer for communication between hardware and software.
It's the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the godmother.
That's right, you know.
It's never going away, but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time on the Internet than we do outside of windows.
What are half the applications that go with the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a small example.
I took this picture in a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
By the way, last week we confirmed the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It's not coming in early 2009, but at the end, so we'd better count to 2010.
I'm sure Microsoft is going to try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio once shone in Edward Zwick's "Bloody Diamond", as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather", and it is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the list of his life roles, we can dive right down to the image of the typical muscular guy with a pointy mustache lifting stitches in a nomadic circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton men's underwear, fitting and sleeveless.
English speakers call it 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all the others.
Firstly, for his eponymous name - although he is popularly known as 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as legend has it, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out from the rest in quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost insignificant) Belgian flag, which the models of the most emblematic bodies have as a neck detail.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't just specialize in tank tops.
They also make college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy shirts, kids' suits, mini shorts...
Well thought out pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Who's going to be a father, I don't care".
The striking resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small in stature, is a woman of great vitality.
The Cruz sisters are taking their new fashion venture very seriously.
For Monica, it means more than just some pretty, famous girl lending her name.
In Paris, she attended a promotional event organized by Mango at its new headquarters and the announcement of the more modest fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She's warm and shy and will get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango this fall-winter season, and I'm also here to attend the second annual Mango Fashion Awards and the Valentine's dinner at the Opera House.
So it was a challenging but exciting day.
What's the new line for Mango, where you've been working for four seasons?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s and we were inspired by them.
I also like to walk around the city and watch women walk around dressed, combining and layering their clothes, which I do a lot.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but at the end of the day, everything is connected and has many connections.
I mean, I've always liked clothes, and I've always wanted to go to my grandmother's, and I've always wanted to go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to be careful about how I dressed.
You know, we dancers rely on how well we're tuned to feel when we look in the mirror at our classes and exams.
And as an actress, when you get a costume, that's when you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with a lot of respect for the designers and the professionalism.
You were 30 years old, did you have a crisis?
No, I'm not.
I feel better than I've ever felt before. I'm enjoying my 30s.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience, and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
Ever since I was little, I've been doing what I want, and that gives me a lot of inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body wants me to be a mother, and besides, I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father is concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But I know one thing for sure, I'm gonna make my kid feel happy and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you're about to premiere a few of the movies you made last year.
I am, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in theaters.
I come from the theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything now, and of course I can't.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of "The Last Mountain" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ".
Whatever you like...
You had your premiere a few days ago at the fairgrounds with Naomi Campbell, is that right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm gonna stand on the pier like a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization, Women for a Better Life, and the clothes that we were showing -- I even picked two models from our collection for Mango -- went on sale, and the proceeds went to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of things being said about her, and I, knowing her, can tell you that a lot of it isn't true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick with the good he's doing.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a stand, I'll do it too.
For the sake of Third World women, I will do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car when drunk or if he is not breathing.
The proposal was made public in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the High Prosecutor's Office, which says it is a pilot project for one year.
The aim is to get the driver back behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a road re-education course.
In addition to the National Road Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of motorists charged with more than one drunk driving offense will re-sit behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system attached to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe first or if higher than the permitted alcohol concentration is recorded.
The price is over 1000 euros and the perpetrator himself would have to pay it.
A study in this respect carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that the number of offenses on vehicles fitted with this device decreased by 65% during the first year of implementation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary reform of the criminal provisions requires an amendment of the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial version, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in a test run.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) which recommends that the system be installed in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and no "peeptoes"
At 5:40 p.m. British time, as scheduled, a Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed at the presidential hangar at Benita Juarez Airport in México.
The sun had just set, but its rays still forced me to cover my eyes with my hand so that I could see the successor couple getting off the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials were under the stairs.
A few hours ago, I was on the street asking the taxi driver if he knew the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, it's not like we're gonna get to the airport to pick up people... she's from around here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right.
But the Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport, just off the red carpet and the military cordon, which is made up of 27 Marines ready to fire a salute of honor.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit, and the princess, very modestly dressed and with her hair splattered, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently having been told that a storm is coming in D.F.
Before they pass into the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and unforcibly interrupt them.
A Mexican television reporter is waiting for them at the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city.
Best subsidised fashion price
I don't think there's a better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and I don't think there's a more brilliant designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow for an international presentation of new fashion talent.
The price is subsidised at EUR 300 000.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the first-year winner, was looking at her designs yesterday at the Manga exhibition at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Sure, it's the second-largest store in Europe for this company and it just opened at 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, coupled with a desire to thank the designers, Valentin, for presiding over the competition jury, led to a lavish dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
The Mango's solemnly decorated chairman's table looked even more amazing than Chagall's most distinguished works.
With her heart broken and saddened by the recent death of her brother, Nati, wearing a branded dress and breath-taking ELAH jewelry, and hanging herself on her son Luis - a nearly six-foot-tall elephant - accompanied Valentine to the head of the table for a dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, was welcomed and, like a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without a jacket, as they were both offered to two ladies.
Monica Cruze, who arrived at the store in her own-designed pants and shirt and dressed in her long, sexy black dress for dinner, was impressed by the night walk at the Opera with Goya Toledó, showed us the ballet rehearsal room, and, in remembrance of other times, grabbed one of the bars and pointed to the "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stop to tour the outbuildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to admire the presence of Olivier Martinez - another young man on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own linens and towels and requested in advance that no scents be used in his rooms.
The stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh, there, that's life.
1001 - stress number
Not a thousand, but a thousand plus one way to forget the chaotic and furious everyday life.
And to top it off, they're all in one book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 as punishment, but even worse is imagining yourself absorbed in the rushed rhythm that present life brings.
Office is called tension and computer is called back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two ways to deal with daily exhaustion and problems and to disconnect from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger and no smaller than 1001.
Beyond yoga poses, classic massages, and spa therapy, Susannah Marriott has compiled a menu of options in her book, tailored to each individual's taste and time.
The book, titled "1001 Ways to Relax", is being published by Pearson Alhambra and DK to bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone believes that peace of mind cannot be achieved in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" refutes this view.
In addition, it offers other ways to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline that restores balance in your body is no longer flowing through your veins, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit down on the couch, shut down, and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but it's really insignificant.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somnolence.
It's pretty common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you have heard that he spoke in his sleep at night.
This may occur very sporadically (e.g. once in a lifetime in cases of high fever) or more regularly (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There's no single reason for her coming.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night rabies, nocturnal enuresis (night sweats), or menstruation, but this is not necessarily the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress, or wakefulness.
In any case, it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears also varies.
The child may speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (screams, crying, long speeches, etc.).
In cases where it manifests with great force, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if there is any problem that causes great anxiety and manifests itself in this way.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it's not curable unless it's associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (like if it's associated with apnea syndrome or chronic stress).
But we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple precautions, such as:
Try not to upset the baby too much before he goes to bed.
So seek out calm games and avoid frightening or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who are difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain a measure of inner calm.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
If somnolence appears, try to remain calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that he will not remember anything the next day.
Helpful Tips
Don't be the one.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll interrupt his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and therefore he rests.
Remember, if you have repeatedly felt that your child is very distressed, it may be appropriate to seek counsel or to find out what is causing the distress.
If you can understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and to extract information.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
Furthermore, you may hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming about or why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and draw your own conclusions.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not for fun.
It's very distressing.
Just don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern finally found its way back to victory after a long period of weakness.
Without playing a particularly big game, the Yellow and Black created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a victory.
The game was not too fast during this encounter, in which the attackers were only barely advancing.
After the first attempt of Captain Kauffmann's guest, who fired from a distance just a hair's throw past the clutch, Illhaeusern was starting to have a slight lead and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on the long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field, leaving only the agile Riahi at the head of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, firstly thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie, Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well placed to handle the ball bounced after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
Gólman Illhaeuser, however, did not enjoy the joy for long, and after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates weakened.
However, Dannemarie was unable to take advantage of this and the Illhaeusern XI, who withdrew only slightly to "stop" the defence, did not cause any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball after a great confusion passed very close to the bat.
Sarkozy goes to angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a trip through Brittany.
To face the demonstration of the strength of the fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Norman ports, the French president decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter have promised that he will be received "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the 'crisis committee' set up by the Breton fishermen to get action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which have peaked at an average of more than €1.14 per litre.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the President "will discuss with them solutions that can be envisaged in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and pay of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with impunity.
They carried out a "brain" operation in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados on Tuesday morning, causing nearly 10km of traffic jams.
The Quiberon marina was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Île were not interrupted.
A filtration dam has been commissioned on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday, burning tires and pallets at dawn in the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained in port, or Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the traffic of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped blocking the important Total refinery in Donges overnight.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before they could decide to act.
The 'crisis committee' is due to decide on Tuesday in Guilviniec how to proceed and whether to attend a meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the state fisheries department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue", because "the fishermen will not give up" and "they do not want to come to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, president of the fisheries department in Lorient.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the tax on diesel currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but they consider that the threshold for the profitability of a ship is only reached when the diesel is below EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman is a spectacular
The unforgettable Butch Cassidy and the Kid star died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes have paid homage to the film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who has died aged 83.
Embraer maintains its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that is looming over the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, is maintaining its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first six months, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has a lot of promise from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers over a period of eight years.
AIG is reportedly considering divesting 15% of its assets.
American International Group, an insurance company that has been bailed out by the U.S. Treasury, is considering giving up more than 15 percent of its assets to pay off the $85 billion in down payment, reports Sunday's Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to explore the sale of most of its activities outside of its international life insurance and pension activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
The FT reports that the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss the possible transfer.
No confirmatory statement could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to divest include its subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the risk of the U.S. authorities seizing 80% of its capital, while also diluting the current shareholders to an appropriate extent.
Paris, analysis of the historic meeting of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic drop on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bail out the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The biggest drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day trading resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq technology-dominated index lost 199,61 points to 1 983,73 according to the final post-trade data and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Squeezed from the start of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the House of Representatives' plan to bail out the banks, a plan that was supposed to allow the markets to find some stability again.
By 228 votes to 205 with the House of Representatives, the House of Representatives has refused to grant Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the funds he requested.
Two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market, which sees that Congress is unable to adopt a certain plan", says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market relied on this plan,' she added, expressing concern that the project, which was adopted in a few days, would not come 'too late'.
"If this project is doomed to failure . . . , the rod will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to fuel the crisis, further tightening credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And stressing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings the downfall of one financial institution".
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities arranged for the purchase of Wachovia Bank's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has taken a sudden turn and has called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not dealing "only with the American crisis, but with the global crisis", added an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has gone up.
The 10-year treasury yield fell to 3,632% from 3,827% on Friday night, the 30-year yield to 4,161% from 4,357% the day before.
Obama won the points in the first televised duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, the second debate was followed by the task of determining who won between John McCain and Barack Obama.
The campaign commanders of Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when they both declared victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, as decent as it was, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, the decline in the polls.
The Gallup poll, which was released on Saturday and puts Obama ahead by five points (49% vs. 44% for McCain), says the Democrat is the winner.
Of the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the supposedly good performance of his running mate Joseph Biden, during his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's talented", Bill Clinton pointed out over the weekend.
McCain, 70, has consistently touted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while also emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on issues that were at the heart of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama seems to have misunderstood that"... was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president", he added.
It's in this offensive spirit that Republican TV spots have been airing since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He kept his head and was very concise and precise.
He has exalted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good name of the United States to the world.
"McCain still didn't get it, while Obama did", responded a Democratic spot over the weekend, which blamed the Republican for not considering enough the impact of the crisis on the "ordinary American".
"In this 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing to say about you", Obama told a gathering of 20,000 people in a rainy morning in North Carolina.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "working class", and the financial collapse clearly benefits Obama, who Americans see as more likely to save the economy from the brink.
"The turning point could be next week", said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as run by George Bush and as promoted by Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reiterated that despite Wall Street's unexpected jumps, he should be able to cut taxes for 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that realizing the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last night, which is highly unpopular.
"Have you noticed that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening just after the closing of polling stations in the main square of Minsk to protest the irregularity of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "Dictator, resign".
Some admit that they did not vote: "What good would it do if they did whatever they wanted with my vote anyway", says one youth.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian heads of state and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are considered clean by observers.
The opposition said it wasn't.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count", complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of 12 parties.
"It's a cosmetic change", emphasises Alexander Milinkiewicz, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "because it's who counts the votes that matters, and in our country it's the executive.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it'll be by being nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in regions and draft laws".
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political process, because "there is a need to start a dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we don't reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election, will not declare the election valid.
It stresses that turnout appears to be too high and that the widespread introduction of early voting (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there have been elections?" asks the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was not a foot in the polling booth.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are most in favour of the regime".
The night's silence has once again taken hold in October Square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Interview - Blood That is Sure Again
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly delighted that Héma-Québec had become one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the public's trust, which had been seriously shaken by the blood-tainted scandal of the 1980's and 1990's.
As is well known, the national blood supply administered by the Transfusion Department of the Canadian Red Cross was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In response to this tragedy and the wave of public unwillingness, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances leading up to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to ensure that such a disaster would not happen again.
While Judge Krever was delaying the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee took up this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, to supply Québec, and the Canadian Blood Company, to supply all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec started its operations in 1998, only 38 percent of the population still had confidence in the Quebec blood system", recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
Through continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area, we have regained public confidence over the years", he says, proudly adding that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population had trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is a very fragile thing".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the prudent approach.
"We were seeing many cases of mad cow disease in Europe at the time, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease", says a woman who has led the company since it was founded in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could be spread through blood.
We therefore based ourselves on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, namely that in cases where we do not know and where there is a serious disease at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterised by degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, preventive measures should be taken.
So in April 1999, we refused blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Then, a few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease is transmitted through blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to follow the precautionary principle".
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid assay (NAT) tests, which detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood directly, rather than the presence of antibodies, on which previous tests were based.
NAT tests have shortened the silent period between the time a patient is infected and when our technicians can detect the first viruses in the blood, she explains.
We've managed to cut that down to less than a week.
We've significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without us knowing and without us knowing.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood is now one in 12 million.
"In other words, before someone becomes infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will be 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe transfusions of blood needed for healing in complete peace", says the head of Hema-Québec.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what pathogenic element might appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus was discovered on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through insect bites.
Constant vigilance is needed,' continues Dr Décary, stressing that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also expect sufficient supplies.
"Needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of eligible Quebecers".
Any healthy person who is at least 18 years old, who meets the eligibility criteria, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who offer blood are not accepted because they have, say, AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mudslides are common, they are excluded for a year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
The deficiencies are very rare.
However, the number of members in the donor network needs to be increased in proportion to their age and their inability to donate blood.
However, persuading people to donate blood is difficult, especially when it comes to keeping them and encouraging them to become regular donors.
Life is so unrestrained today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood", lamented Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also runs the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
Once considered biomedical waste, the cord is teeming with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the deposit of our thousandth cord blood sample to the bank a few weeks ago, and we expect to collect over a thousand a year.
Early next year we should start offering them for transplants", says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as a very popular one.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it", since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montreal qualified for the USL First Division knockout round yesterday at Saputo Stadium in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinals, with a 3-1 win over the Seattle Sounders.
Defender Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a double-header, quarterback David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could get Matt Jordan to do the sounders.
As a reminder, on Friday, during the first of two quarterfinal games, Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be facing the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder tied the deficit at home 3-1, and eventually won 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round with a 5-4 goal total.
The Impact are scheduled to play the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short, Kovalev's winning goal.
The first three Canadiens are ready to kick off the season.
A unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekhance and Andrey Kosticin cheered the attack to a 3-2 win for the Canadiens on the road yesterday night at the Bell Centre.
Kosticin, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev scored one goal in this fourth victory of the three-color out of six preliminary matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring the only goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet", the Russian pointed out.
"I need one more fight to feel good".
"He tried to handle too much in the first quarter", noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He got a big round of applause".
Charest is betting on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) congress, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today's by-election.
'Drawing the line of our last great northern frontier': this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented in a visually compelling way yesterday at the conclusion of the Quebec Liberal Party congress in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in a kind of picture mill.
There was a loop running on three huge canvases with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the "Google Maps" view, maps, etc.
Generous funds, just like in the election.
In fact, at a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling an early election in the fall, although he noted that he had a very busy schedule.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth dimension of the "vision" the Prime Minister intends for Québec, the vision of the "new economic area", which includes the labour agreement with France, the convention between Canada and Europe and the agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - has been mentioned by the Prime Minister in recent times, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "jewel with enormous potential", but did not give a timeline, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned at most several approaches to points which could be further divided: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forestry, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the rapid growth of developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
The North, according to Charest's calculations, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "area twice the size of France is with us", is in Quebec.
And it's not just with us, it's in us", he stressed, as if to show that he was referring to a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, the Prime Minister pointed out: the Abitibi gold rush, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future", he added, after a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70 per cent of Quebec, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the premier said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one line of demarcation on which there is no convention for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will take up this position again on behalf of the Government,' he indicated.
Otherwise, "we also need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change", he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round as a result of melting glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister feels that taking territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequino MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with some 30 communities.
The action was taken by an interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) is an important member.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be outlined".
The development of the North should, after all, be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan will be "collectively designed, structured and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a seamless continuation of the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we have changed our mindsets to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the still-shaky themes of the weekend, which began with a big cocktail on Friday to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's rise to the party leadership.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross the Beauharnois headquarters at the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godboute, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who led the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourras, who created James Bay, our party has shaped the future", declared Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, and that was the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came time for the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric power station, Charest stressed that its start-up was planned for 2012.
"I'm saying this just between us, but I plan to be there", he told his membership, which drew considerable applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this autumn, which is permitted by law.
However, he stressed that his agenda was busy, especially the Federal Council mission to China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend convention provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "constitutional amendment efforts", which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Quebec Liberal Party) demands in particular that the "specificity of Quebec" be recognized in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Quebec appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
The main features of the Plan Nord were received with scepticism by the opposition.
The PQ (Parti Québecois) leader, Pauline Marois, reiterated the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by Landry's government in 2001.
She said that when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it gave up on implementing this policy.
If she had stuck to it, "we would have been ahead today", Marois said, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the Northern Plan in the government.
"We hope it will not be just a theatre", explained Sébastien Proulx, leader for Maria Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - Countries not honoured
It was Vic Toews, the former justice minister (ironically) in Harper's cabinet, who dared to say last summer that Louise Arbour was a "disgrace" to Canada.
To disgrace in this way a woman who has led a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government which is the only one of the Western countries involved that has not repatriated a citizen of its own from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account that at the time of the alleged acts, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature to the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to determine the guilt of the accused.
It should be recalled that UNICEF, Amnesty International and in particular the Canadian Bar Association are advocating for Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
The government also turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is psychologically destroyed, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture.
We don't realize it, but we're witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", words that Harper so cherishes and that sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him at the whim of the head of the so-called minority government (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that proclaims Dignity, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Towes, is in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Opinions - Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was printed by Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Barrick Gold, a Canadian mining company.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a libel suit against three authors and a pathetic small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate" and is seeking six million dollars.
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truth, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver completely skips that crucial distinction.
Or is the best way for Barrick Gold to drive public debate, to bankrupt anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will be forced to spend considerable sums to prepare to defend and fight a highly uneven battle with an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining companies.
The tactics in these unbalanced fights, moreover, often consist in the destruction of the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will silence the opposing side and, moreover, frighten anyone who dares to enter into the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they should have presented their view of the matter to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate is normally about the exchange of ideas, not the lashing of a club.
So it was not enough for the mining companies to open their books, their documentation and to create a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and is vehemently rejecting petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
It seems that in the Vice President's world, that word refers only to the well-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that's a rather narrow definition of the term.
In a democracy, even the disrespectful have a say.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public supporting the writers and publishers of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the case, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant is to be gagged (in its "public debate" prosecution, by the way, Barrick has just issued an official appeal to Noir Canada to inform them officially to stop using the term...).
Apart from Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct assault on the university's freedom of inquiry and search for truth, which is essential to any democratic society.
It generally denies the right to cite reliable sources and to debate facts and interpretations that are the very basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that are not liked by the wealthy corporations of this world without being subjected to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, they could have created one if they followed the scientific standards that Noir Canada authors use.
He has a right to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debate and disagreement and to resolve conflict.
Barrick Gold's outrageous lawsuit clearly shows that despite what it claims, it has no desire to conduct a transparent debate.
It's a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it's time for governments to put in place measures to limit this type of unwarranted prosecution.
The Wall Street bailout operation - Democrats and Republicans getting along
The Bush administration and members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to stem the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control by elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money deposited, new measures to capture the number of houses seized for non-payment and the right to monitor the salaries paid to executives of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican negotiating delegate Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We've made great strides and we've reached an agreement that will work in the markets", said Henry Paulson, a spokesman for the Bush administration.
"Everything was done to keep the real economy and the average American safe from the crisis that's going on on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"This is the bottom line: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be enormous", said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have been running at full speed, fearing the effect of further failure on investors' mood.
The time limit was the markets opening this morning.
Both candidates for the US presidency were later invited to negotiate and both expressed themselves rather in favour of an agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited the amendment to the agreement with some measures, especially one aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes and a wage measure for government-backed workers.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is no point in congratulating ourselves.
But these measures are necessary", he explained on television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, when asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so".
"The rough lines I've read [suggest] that this is something we're all going to have to digest and move on from.
To choose inaction is simply unacceptable", he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy back with taxpayer money the dubious claims and risky and unsold assets of American financial institutions.
The plan follows a 14-month crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then moved to other, more extensive forms of credit (PCAA), resulting in cash freezes and the break-up of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first draft of the agreement last week is the fault of the Republican lawmakers.
Since the Democrats have agreed that some of the toxic assets of troubled companies will be guaranteed by the government, not bought, there is a belief that the deadlock is set.
In an effort to reconcile the conflicting views in Congress, a provision was attached providing that the government could introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it had to take losses as a result of the program for five years.
The new plan includes a first deposit of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies, which will pay him dividends if they make a profit, and which he can resell when it's over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of real estate linked to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to the executives of the affected companies.
The plan's authors would like to put it to a vote in the House today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it's not yet certain that their plan will go green.
Yesterday, there was a continuing backlash against the bill from both the Republican and Democratic parties.
"It's clear that Washington can't hear you", said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, addressing voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But taxpayer profits are not the answer".
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a congressional group nicknamed the "Committee of Skeptics", presents the matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and to consider carefully which way to go", he declared yesterday.
At the same time, the crisis in Europe has been reaffirmed as a global crisis.
Following the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11,2 billion (USD 16,3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since losing EUR 2 billion (USD 2,9 billion) in the wake of the risky mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is among the 20 largest European banks and among the 10 largest insurance companies.
"We will not lose this money", said the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we get voting rights in the bank and influence.
This is what the landlords and households can appreciate in these uncertain times".
On the other side of the Channel, meanwhile, the British government seems to have begun the nationalisation of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) were for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander is buying the branches and accounts of the British bank's clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with blue eyes long represented his strength, according to others, weakness.
Has this American actor with a charming smile escaped from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and relentless talent that were his own also kept him from the power category that makes for true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he was similar and long a sort of rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was German-Jewish and his mother was of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots, one of the great faces of the American dream was born.
Without the exaggerated ego, which is the last mark of quality.
Because he was the one who saw this whole country in love with the self-made man, a war veteran in the Pacific, wounded in battle, who studied acting at Yale in the early '50s, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated his triumph in theater, television and soon in film.
The same civil rights activist was also a race car driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and a sex symbol, despite having been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
And with it go the shadowy places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the whimsy of show business itself, which will forever remain somewhat mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has left film lovers dizzy as his great roles compete on the black screen of memories.
It is followed by more than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art.
The memory re-emerges as the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, a 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation.
From a time not so long ago (1990) we remember his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that failed to meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the abusive, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role originally intended for James Dean, assumed after his death, which in 1956 brought Newman into the limelight.
The sympathetic gangster in the absolutely brilliant The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful pool player in Robert Rosen's stunning The Hustler (1961), the same character he portrayed in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar nomination in 1987 out of seven.
This face wandering through the ages, that was him.
And then there's him.
His career is a race between different eras.
Young people know him best for his iconic Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) as Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He then closed his career by playing the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike several film legends who left the business fairly early, Newman remained in the business long after he denounced Hollywood for its glitz, pomp and concession.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered it "a lively challenge to underplaying", judging that he pushed too hard in his performances.
For the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles came as a surprise, the profession was not always so tender.
But he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, thugs and desperate people, whose downfall and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman has revealed the little-known sides of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on a novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, provides a sensitive portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son to his son Scott, who died of a drug overdose, a work full of shame and sadness.
In the tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (who co-starred in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented, "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of life, such are the chief qualities of a dead actor.
Aside from his legendary career, he's also a great civil rights activist, environmentalist, independent filmmaker, and opponent of Hollywood's decline.
We used to see his image on vinegar bottles, sauces, cookies and other foods, which might seem rather unpleasant, although at first it was a gag.
However, the proceeds from the sale went to his Foundation for a Troubled Childhood.
So, rather than be swayed by fame, Newman engaged in the company until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters that contained the following words: "Your father was always, and to the end, grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here".
And it was an honor to follow the career of such a visionary and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & Co. invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are charged with fraud, including forgery of documents, as well as with long-term and systematic criminal activities by a criminal organisation, which have caused exceptionally significant damage.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money obtained in public tenders for their own purposes and often used fictitious invoices to prove the completion of their tasks.
The money from the state and local authorities - a total of approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money obtained in the public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration and the undertakings accepted by the association were never received.
According to the prosecution, a large portion of the invoices were counterfeit.
The forms for these invoices came from the market in Józsefváros, the circular stamp was made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of the companies on which invoices are to be issued were decided, inter alia, on the roundabout on the northern shore of Balaton, which István Lados sent János Zuschlag to.
According to his testimony, the first appointment was to look at boarding houses and restaurants.
In those documents, he requested accounts for his consumption, the model of which was then used to produce invoices submitted in the context of public tenders organised by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Metropolitan Government.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados and his partner András Őr, who, according to our information, wrote the most frequent reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip", Lados spotted a cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this catering establishment provided catering for a group of 90 members of Biztos Pont.
However, the company's manager claimed that this large number of people could not fit into the facility at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later by Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was riddled with errors of form and content.
The boarding house in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet the bill listed 130 guests.
The imaginative printing presses, however, went too far when they listed on the documents a company also involved in the hospitality industry, Pigal s.r.o., whose accounts, according to the information provided to the Public Prosecutor's Office, did not even contain documents bearing the names Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
The head of Győző Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"Our company name and tax number were on the wrong stamp".
He added that, apart from the formalities, the fact that according to the invoice, they accommodated 100 people was also not acceptable, because they only have 11 rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also stated the catering, and their restaurant has not been operating for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were not even convinced that the prominent Budapest travel agency was organising only international trips, and they foolishly referred to the cash-paid invoice, which was also inconsistent with the firm's invoicing practice, as a travel agency service in Hungary.
Moreover, as it emerged during the investigation, VAT was also mentioned in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation did not include the amount of VAT, since the company's activities were not subject to the 25% VAT, but to the 15% VAT, and the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, but the invoice was handwritten.
Furthermore, the 'issuers' corrupted the invoice, for example by referring to one company as having carried out, as revealed by the prosecutor's investigation, a road haulage activity which the company, which was originally based on investment advice, did not carry out.
The fact that invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért foundation and by the XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Pont Biztos associations are false was also revealed due to formal discrepancies - the incorrect invoice format and the false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k.s. or the Kunfehérto Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy operator in the Netherlands, which is not a market economy operator.
They were knowingly issuing invoices
The second group of invoicers are those who knew they were to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued bills for approximately four million forints to the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Socialisták organization.
The Director of Collab s.r.o. was, according to the indictment, forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlag and its partners were also cooperated with by Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations with invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million, which were not in the form of actual economic activity.
Nor did the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
The other group of invoicing firms include those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió s.r.o., a company involved in the trading of fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but the company is not located there.
The company immediately issued several invoices for the sale of computing equipment worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005.
According to the information found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment s.r.o. of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian man, to whom he was to deliver documents concerning the company also belonging to Ivan Kubatov from 2002 to 2005.
As we know, during the investigation Kubatov admitted that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the associations Atlas, Hoppá and the foundations Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and that he himself received their countervalue.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s.
In fact, none of the firms were working, according to the defendant, because they were not employed.
Nevertheless, the companies were to his advantage, since at the request of the co-defendant, Zsolt Szente, who also drew up their articles of association, he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció, which were linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has issued a total of 15 invoices worth HUF 14,2 million to the organisations.
The prosecutor's office determined that Kubatov received 10 percent of the invoice and VAT amounts.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért associations submitted their proposals to the public competition of the Mihálye Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They each received 500 000 forints, but did not spend the sums on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To keep this from becoming apparent, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found during a home search in Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, some of the defendants will probably describe the process of producing the invoices, as they did at the prosecutor's office.
What might be interesting is if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything himself.
His testimony so far has been rather vague, and although he has promised several times to give a full account, he has not done so.
The question is, is it in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, maybe the socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He could have been offended, as his requests for a reduction in his detention, namely to house arrest, have so far remained unanswered.
While economic offenders who have committed much more damage and have not yet recovered can walk around freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have that option.
The psychology of trump: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neurological and economic basis for this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been uncovered by researchers at New York University's Department of Neuroscience and Economics.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don't want to fall behind in an eBay-style auction, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Researchers have been trying to map the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system by experimental auction.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a playful auction, and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method was used to examine the active areas of the subjects' brains.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, an important element of which is to beat the other side, a whole under the cerebral cortex called the striatum became activated when losing.
This brain region plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system, among many other functions.
The researchers therefore consider that the price screening can be explained by the attempt to avoid a sharp reaction of the striates.
To support their theory, members of the research team of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional study.
Three groups bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
Additionally, members of the other group were promised an additional $15 in prize money if they came out on top.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but if they lost, they lost that money too.
So the difference between the two groups was that one group was emphasized as winning and the other as losing.
However, members of the "playing against" group were willing to go higher than those in the "winning" and "control" groups, confirming the neurological hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
They have explained the phenomena observed in auctions of the joy of winning and the avoidance of risk.
Neurological imaging has helped us to resolve the discrepancy between these two theories, so that we have now come to a third explanation", says Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When to See a Doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is listed as a leading cause of death.
The number of domestic hepatitis cases is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are treated, because the sick often do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective term for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
They have many similarities in their symptoms, with hepatitis and jaundice being the hallmarks, but the pathogens and the diseases they cause are different.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e. g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses in the blood and body fluids (sperm, faecal secretions, saliva).
Travellers should in any case protect themselves by vaccinating against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus type C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal pain, vomiting.
Then the skin and eye whites become yellow, the stool lightened, and the urine darkened.
Each year, a million people worldwide die from the more serious form of the disease, liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected persons is receiving medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.
Most people who are infected do not know they have the disease, and the virus is so insidious that it destroys liver cells that in many cases the first symptoms do not appear until 20 or 30 years later.
Therefore, early prevention, regular detection, is very important.
Three groups have a much higher than average incidence of the disease: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory tests, a person should consult his or her physician if any symptoms of unknown origin are noticed.
If detected early, the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing infection and preventing cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first celebrated worldwide in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
It aims to raise awareness of chronic hepatitis caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early detection.
Who believes in God doesn't feel this pain?
According to recent research, belief in God acts as a kind of analgesic that may have eased death even for Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to investigate how belief in a god affects a person's perception of pain, reports Britain's Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks while all were watching a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to rule out much of the pain.
By examining the human brain in detail, it was also shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies involving academics as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was carried out by attaching a spark device to the left hand of the subject, which gave electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to look intently at two paintings: Sassoferrato's 17th-century Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century Lady with a Border.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of devotion in the faithful, whereas the da Vinci painting was chosen because it was not very different from the first and, according to them, had a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electric shocks in four successive sessions, while they separately viewed an image with a religious or general theme.
Catholics reported that looking at the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if they were "taken care of", and "calmed down, filled with peace".
When viewing a religious painting, they reported feeling 12 percent less pain than when they were in front of a Leonardo.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was involved in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even for atheists, just by finding the right photograph.
"We have to find an image that they will see very positively, from the perspective of a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practice of faith should change, and in many cases will change, our personality", Wright added.
After such brilliant results, it's only a question of what effect would it have on the regulation of the pain of the faithful if they were shown a Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar calibre.
Would a good view of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share
On its tenth birthday, Google may declare that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above them; they know where they've been on vacation, what expert investigations they're going to, and what they're interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, that's still not enough.
But for the skeptics who parallel Orwellian dark vision, they're not exactly clear about the very nature of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal information about users, which is necessary if the founders of Google are to stick to their original intention: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to a Google official, after ten years of global work, the company is only at the beginning of its work with all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like, "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of job would I be doing?" - seemingly simple questions, but the software won't be able to answer until it knows enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that the search terms are captured precisely during the Internet search, as well as the IP address from which the search was made and the pages to which the searchers have moved.
For example, with Personalized Search, launched two years ago, users can save their browsing history, look back at what they searched for and clicked on, and in the long term generate findings that are much more tailored to them - the same logic will be used for Recommendations, whereby the system will offer us products and services based on previously mentioned and saved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm doing? ask users who are afraid to look at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more alarming, the backlash does not provoke guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom or even rebellion against power in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured but can also be disclosed to third parties in justified cases, in such legal cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected.
Perhaps the most well-known recent example was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites it set up.
However, privacy-conscious netizens were relieved in May when the company, in partnership with the electronic rights group EFF, successfully proved its case against the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought off nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it obtained by appealing to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act passed years ago, yet it failed to get individual user search lists, or complete lists of websites and keywords, covering a two-month period.)
The view of Google is quite contradictory: it is being whipped by those who fear giving their personal data because they feel that their private sphere and private life will be compromised by starting to use Google services, and they are rebelling against it with the kind of revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, the enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, emerging in many countries, see in him a new generation of big business, "the corporation that's now busting", as opposed to its rival Microsoft, which is considered to be the world's conqueror because of Windows, however both are fighting for the same goals.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require users to provide an identification code or pay for its applications; the open, free and constantly fresh source of information and software package seems much more accessible, youthful, "cooler" than the official software giant's practice.
But it could also be because geeks have a very good understanding of the very problematic relationship between the Internet and privacy rights, which has brought about one of the most cliched keywords of recent years: Web 2.0.
Because Web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, about intentionally leaving behind a footprint and using the channels of communication that we have, and while the scope is different in everyone, the essence is the same: we show up.
The average young person can have a profile on several community sites, from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, which records the music he listens to, and then he can connect to navigation systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and he can also write a blog, where his latest photo gallery will automatically appear, which he stores on Flickru or Picase.
We can read about many examples of how it shines through: a friend in the morning can easily tell who her funny boyfriend spent the evening with by looking at a flood of photos of their mutual friends, or a company can fire an employee just because he writes his honest opinion about senior management on its blog: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has been completely reassessed today.
The online life is what you show up to be, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to keep something secret or at least avoid Google's monopoly has a choice (starting with Scroogl, who uses Google's search engine but intentionally leaves no trace).
For example, a significant number of people don't register on community sites on purpose, so they can't be found. Google's online apps from text editor to photo editor to news portal can be swapped for alternative versions that aren't connected to the giant server park and that don't build the best possible profile of us.
Public opinion is not too secretive about waiting for Google to show its teeth.
At its current value, the company is worth $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion), or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense ad space is threatening the investment of advertising agencies, and the services being introduced at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously disrupting not only Microsoft but also numerous other software designers.
However, critics also find counter-points that are disturbing: for example, the top management completely rejected the protests of employees after doubling the company's tuition fees, the arbitrary frequency of the daily meals for employees was too expensive according to the management of the company, all of which is lost alongside the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government back in 2006 and, according to their agreement, filters out any findings that are in the best interest of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never announces new services in advance until they are ready to be used, but what is certain is that the problems expected in the months and years ahead could be stirring the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project to scan and archive books and magazines is gaining such scale that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its health system, in which we can build our own complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is compiling a genetic database can then serve as a good starting point for the next generation of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which humans can be intimidatingly close to each other only with the help of Google data.
The double murderer from Oz was helped to remove the tracks by two teenagers
Two teenagers were questioned by police in the case of a double murder in Ózd, and were suspected of helping to remove traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Department said on Tuesday.
The individuals who were suspected of the activity have confessed and are currently charged with aiding and abetting.
Both juveniles, according to MTI, two girls, are on the loose.
Aiding and abetting a crime is punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a premeditated multiple homicide for obvious reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old man owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect refused to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor into a factory in Ozd last Wednesday, killing first a man and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man had prepared for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion CZK - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had already excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish bid represents the highest amount ever offered to a candidate for the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the bids have so far been submitted by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all the interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts to be worth between 5 and 10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25% of the shares, followed by Česká spořitelná with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13,5%.
The financial crisis in the European leaflets
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers are already reminiscing about "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster is due to the American president, La Repubblica of Rome accuses, who has been unable to even muster his own party to support the bill, which is aimed at remedying this desperate situation.
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded me of the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second 9/11
Also, part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the whole world will pay for it.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, notes the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still provide a lifeline for the burning financial institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither cash nor further improvisation will suffice.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must overcome their national egoism and unify their control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the ruling monetary institutions received more than 100 billion euros, recalls Vienna's Der Standard, which warns that fears are growing that European taxpayers will have to go deep in their pockets to solve the crisis, as Americans have.
The European Union is facing a crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami, and it has not yet taken any serious action.
The "rescuers" may not be waving hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they firmly determined when it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money to prevent even greater damage.
A smart car simulates the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop collision-preventing technologies if not by mimicking obstacle detectors found in the natural world?
Like with bees.
The initial strategic idea for the surprising project, presented at the CEATEC trade fair in Japan, was inspired by Nissan's engineers, bees, to build a new generation of crash-prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed the BR23C biomimetic robotic control system, a robotic minicar that is equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging", explained Kazuhiro Doi, the brand's general manager for technology PR and R&D, at the exhibition.
Importantly, the compound eyes allow the bees to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To replicate the function of the compound eye, engineers came up with the idea of a laser telescope.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres in front of the BR23C in a 180° field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
The obstacle is detected within a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to mimic the bee's movements and, by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid a collision, immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is done in a completely instinctive manner.
"Without this, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, within which collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process has to reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take more than a blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, this movement cannot be upward, downward, or angular, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to the bees by avoiding, the robot car was limited to rotating, accelerating and decelerating.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life than the lithium-ion variants.
Ando says it's instinctive, intelligent reaction that matters, not the ability to process, much less store data.
This mechanism shall only process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
It does not need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses memory of a few kilobytes at a time.
It doesn't need a gigabyte or a megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in developing an immediate avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could be in production cars within 10 years.
Another application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified final destination after avoiding obstacles in the way.
The damn baby already has a name
The $700 billion economic rescue package, to be split into several installments, aimed at buying back bad loans from banks, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further talks, which ended after midnight on Saturday, congressional officials reached an agreement in days of debate on a $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We've made significant progress", announced Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, who said that all that remains is to write a deal.
The compromise package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The result of the compromise, said Henry Paulson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken".
The paper version of the package was released ahead of the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any particular upturn on the stock exchanges.
The bill, known as the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which is to establish the program, will be voted on Monday first in the House of Representatives, then in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then news of the deal was welcomed at the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program is different from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which was to spend a total of $700 billion on the purchase of substandard mortgage-backed securities.
Now, it's possible to spend up to half of the $700 billion in the first round, with the $250 billion going to be used immediately after the expected Congressional vote on Monday, and the Treasury Department will use it to buy mortgage-backed securities that are rated as substandard, with the fate of the remaining $100 billion then being decided by the president.
The program will be overseen by a special committee, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The second half of the $700 billion will depend on the next congressional decision.
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the law, apply a combined tactic: it may simultaneously buy back bad loans, mortgages and securities backed by mortgages, or other 'toxic' loans.
The buyback can be done through auctions or directly, the competent officials of the Ministry have informed.
The legal provision will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme whereby the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for the funds constituting a cause of concern, for which the companies will pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected losses.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the means to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it be to purchase large amounts of bad assets, insure them, or prevent the systemic risk of the collapse of one of the big financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed", he added.
Bank bosses who are in trouble and waiting for the government to help them can, on the other hand, count on the government to reduce their severance pay - simply called "the golden parachute" in overseas slang.
The limitation of their remuneration will only occur in certain cases, and will depend on the type of aid granted by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys through the auction, the gold parachutes will be taxed unless the fallen bank directors are sent straight to retirement.
In the case of direct repurchase of bad loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money for management is not overspent.
It should be added that the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the restriction only applies to new contracts, which is intended to be a further incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that a law will impose a limit on the compensation of CEOs", commented House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat.
In addition, the State will have the right to acquire a stake in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, who can profit from the transaction once the economy and the rescued bank are back on their feet.
The draft plan states that over the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal to determine how taxpayers can recover their expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were also voices of doubt on both sides of the plan.
"This is not what the American people asked us to do, because this is not going to protect taxpayer dollars", declared Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His Ohio Democrat colleague Mary Kaptur believes that the passage of the ordinance was pushed by the very people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in industry increased in August 2008 by 0,1% compared to the previous month and by 12,9% compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Export sales prices of the industry were 1,1% higher compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3,9% year on year.
As a result of the changes in domestic and export prices, the prices of the industry were higher by 0,7% compared to the previous month, rising by 3,2% year on year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased only marginally, by 0,1%, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly, by 0,1% compared to July.
The largest price increases took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sector (2,8%) mainly due to the monthly price increases in the poultry and saddlery sector of 4,6% and footwear by 2,5% respectively.
The higher price level of plastics and chemicals has led to a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical materials and products industry (1,6 per cent).
The price decrease was recorded in the oil processing sector (1,4%) and in the electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing sector (0,9%), as well as, to a minimal extent, in the wood processing sector (0,1%).
Prices in the paper industry and publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we have measured price increases in the range of 0,2 to 0,9%.
In the electricity, gas and water sectors, which are important in domestic industry, prices rose by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the continuing effect of the officially announced increase in gas prices since 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in the different sectors of the manufacturing industry, the highest price increase was recorded in the specialised sector of oil processing (32,4%).
The steel-processing sector recorded a price increase of 13,2%, followed by a price increase of 11% in the food, beverage and tobacco sector, which is the most important.
The decrease in prices was recorded in the textile and textile products industries (2,5%) and in the electrical machinery and equipment industries (0,3%).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the price growth rate ranged between 0,6% and 9,1%.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing sector increased by 10,2% over the previous year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors were higher than the previous year by 18,7%.
In terms of industry focus, the highest monthly price increase in August was recorded in domestic sales (0.7%) in the sectors involved in the production of tangible assets.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0,3%, while in the energy and manufacturing sectors, prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and downstream sectors (16,8%).
In the consumer goods sectors, we have seen a price increase of 6.8%, while in the material assets sector, prices fell by 1.4%.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1,1% in August compared to the previous month, falling by 3,9% over the same period.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7% against the euro, by 7.1% against the dollar, and by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar in one month compared with August 2007.
You're going to the United States next year without a visa?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungary visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, the foreign minister said in Chicago before local Hungarian community leaders.
In her view, "almost everything now depends on the timely establishment of an electronic system for authorization and controls overseas".
She also pointed out that the new system will not include entry permits, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister is continuing his talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the Middle Cross with Star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and will interview foreign policy advisers for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are both in favor of the bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, unanimously assured their support for the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After several days of marathon deliberations by Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning that a basic agreement had been reached on a bailout package for the banks.
The financial package, which aims to reverse the Wall Street crash and freeze the credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are identifying themselves as the more suitable candidate to pull the country out of the recession.
According to the most recent polls, as economic issues came to the fore, Obama regained a certain edge and McCain's lead, which he had secured after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin for vice president, was eroded.
Obama expressed hope at a rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supported.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) your jobs, your savings, your entire industry, the stability of your entire economy are at risk", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He didn't miss an opportunity to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained: "Everyone will be a little upset . . . but doing nothing is simply not the way to go".
As the Republican senator pointed out, the bill includes the creation of a committee to oversee the finance minister and a limit on the severance pay for top officials, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no significant role in the negotiations, but was in daily contact with the secretary.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of the German-language press
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside have become more confident - this is how Der Spiegel analyses the weak CSU result in Bavaria.
The Haider are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
In an article published online by a left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers", discusses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
The change of seasons is a problem for all Christian democracies, including Angela Merkel.
The breakthrough was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday a process that had been predicted for almost exactly ten years was over: the unquestioned hegemony of one state party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU dropped to 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s it had fallen below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections of 2005, during the period of Stoiber that is still so often remembered.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country, which is eating away at its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but the pace of the events has been very wrong. Secularisation, educational outcomes, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of opportunities, which also has visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside have become more confident, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the most distant from CSU have been the traditional layers of the population: the self-employed, the tradespeople, the graduates and the individuals with higher education.
That's already reduced support for the CSU to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom?
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP shall prevent the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ seems open to any negotiations, the Greens are not yet ready to agree on a coalition.
The elections are over, the focus is now on the coalition; the party leaders did not look at their cards in the debate on public television.
The President of the SPÖ, Werner Faymann, confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
A repetition of this trend is not envisaged.
Molterer responded to the red offers with caution.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses opposition or joins a coalition is still open to debate within the party, and these questions must be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider once again appeared to be open to all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility", Haider said.
Járóková: The cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equality, which this year will be hosted by France, the current EU Presidency, has begun in Paris.
In her message to the plenary, Lívia Járóková, MEP for the Fidesz party, as one of the main speakers of the expert debate, drew attention to segregation in education, which is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society organisations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz group of MEPs, Járóková pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, the Roma are excluded from the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small proportion of them can reach a higher level of education".
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can boost the economies of the EU Member States.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the EU's support for the fight against corruption.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the better chance he or she has of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties, they contribute to the national budget.
'It is the right of Roma to have citizenship in the European Union to ensure their right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and segregated education,' emphasised Lívia Járóková.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of employees from the risks related to the use of certain dangerous substances and preparations is based on the principle that the protection of employees from the risks related to the use of certain dangerous substances is ensured by the directive.
'The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by democracy so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe,' Járóková demanded.
The European Year of Equal Opportunities guarantees everyone the aim of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the equality and elimination of discrimination objectives set at European and national level.
CSU: temporary release
The fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October.
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the Bavarian CSU leaders.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their posts, the question is how long this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent vote loss, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo have made it clear that they will not stick to their posts with all their might.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who demanded the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career - the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but it was only 43.4 percent strong.
The CSU was the "self-rule" in Bavaria, which produces 18 percent of German GDP, for 46 years.
The Conservatives in the southern state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to hold a high position, but they will be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of the close intelligence team that will start probing the possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing Free Voters, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that the Free Voters' candidate, Gabriele Pauli, was elected to parliament, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out a coup, but then they made a ruthlessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, an active role will also be played by Stoiber, who has so far been a back-and-forth man, the former prime minister and former chairman of the CSU, who called 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few scathing comments to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the national success in 2005, somehow gets back on its feet.
According to Merkel, who has been hard pressed to hide her disappointment over the fiasco, the loss of the CSU's positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which is of course relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved in Bavaria with 18.6 percent its weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko: The position is 110:0.
In the election on Sunday, not a single opposition member of parliament got into the Belarusian parliament.
This is due to the prosperity and stability of the country under Alexander Lukashenko, according to Russian observers, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to the irregularities that occurred during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million-strong country has been without opposition for well over a decade, the opposition, united under the name of the United Democratic Forces (UDF) before yesterday's elections, was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who was allowed to renew his presidential mandate for the fourth time in a controversial election in 2006 as a result of a constitutional change, would this time "allow" several opposition MPs to appear in parliament.
The ODS has thus abandoned the boycott it had previously considered.
The background to the opposition's expectation was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has taken credit to mitigate the impact of the ever-pricing Russian gas imports and helped to get Beltransgaz, the company that owns the gas pipelines that run through the country, into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians are denied entry due to the Belarusian political establishment being judged anti-democratic.
The release previously pointed out that the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, emphasised the positive developments rather than the shortcomings - for example, the ban on candidacy for one third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE's Monday flash report, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, especially that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, the opposition says that there is still an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in smaller confrontations with Moscow, as it continues to refuse to recognize Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has been considering these two territories as independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started", Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain the case, even though she "has been too afraid to allow a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament".
Looking at the opposition's results, he's not planning any protest actions, but rather trying to get his message across to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is hampered by local authorities, but I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly", Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest success, does not consider the most officially supported pensioner crop to be correct.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'silence of the cemetery' social security collapses", Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the CIS mission, Sergei Lebedev, told Russia's Ria Novosti news agency that "people don't believe in words, but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
"From now on, breakfast before work".
It's the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that revolving doors have been introduced for staff to enter and leave.
But starting today, this new measure will work against people who are cute, who are intoxicated and then go to coffee during working hours.
The news against the lazy was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renata Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"The back door", says Brunetta, "is a tool for better work, higher performance, more attendance and more services", the minister explains.
"A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism", Brunetta points out.
We'll complete the installation of the Chigi Palace in all the Council's offices.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from the staff, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint process with the staff and cooperation from all".
In short, no more breakfast during office hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing like a proper cappuccino at seven in the morning".
During a conference at the Higher Vocational School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister finally announces that in three months, the absence of public employees for sickness has decreased by 50%, that is 60,000 more people in the workforce per year".
He added that it was necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient.
"its pay dynamics  explains the Minister  has doubled in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public officials have rallied to reject the Brunett Decree standards in line with a petition sponsored by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Administration today presents figures on reduced sickness absence from work, the nation of 'lazy workers' is growing.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and honest public servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree".
The protest will be mainly against the exclusion of sick pay, which depends on the activity; the extension of the time during which the patient can be checked, the time frame within which the check-ups will be carried out, and other norms included in the new ministerial regulations.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a Directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to workplace accidents.
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
Inail's figures confirm that in 2007 we have approximately 1,200 deaths as a result of work-related accidents.
These figures indicate the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains a leading cause of death, causing nearly twice as many deaths as homicides.
To re-awaken the attention of institutions, social and media on this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day of Victims of Work-related Accidents in all Italian regions, on the second Sunday of October.
"The alarming data disseminated by Anmilia and the same tragic news reports of these days confirm the importance of the issue of safety at work", President Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in a report sent to the President of Anmilia, the National Association for the Disabled and Disabled by Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his deep admiration for the continuous joint efforts on safety at work, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the participation of public opinion.'
"Naturally, an angry 'dost' has been raised, honestly shared face to face in the face of tragedies that, by their scale, are causing a stir in the media and public opinion, but the daily reality offers us again dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamics".
Mr Napolitano makes no secret that 'there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
The numerous initiatives in the field of education to raise awareness of young people facing the world of work are particularly important.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up on its worrying social implications, and to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of death as a result of an occupational accident creates an absolutely critical social situation, how it offends the conscience of each of us and compels all the institutions to make a convincing effort to bring about the necessary end of this situation".
"As for the data on occupational accidents, they seem to be showing a certain positive turn, but this does not deny that the number of deaths caused by occupational accidents is alarming", said Anmilu President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not want this 'reduction effort' to lead to less attention, because just when attention ceases, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that, in general, too little is being done to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed  - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the area of training of workers, starting from school age".
"Further efforts are needed", he added  in terms of communication and public participation.
But what is needed is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon which is an exceptional social phenomenon.'
Mercandelli concluded that this was a progressive degeneration of the level of entitlement to compensation for victims of work and a 'shift in supportive care' that the system had been experiencing in recent years.'
"The aim is to return the worker's insurance guarantee", he added, "because the fate of those who injure themselves must not depend on the spontaneity or the occasional gift of the legislator".
MP3 players accused of putting hearing at risk
Prolonged listening to loud music and the use of portable musical instruments such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to the Communication from the European Commission published today, which quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the health risks recently identified (Csrseri) in an official report circulated in Brussels.
"From this scientific viewpoint", we read in the footnotes, "it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music with portable musical instruments for at least five years, more than an hour a day a week, and keep the instrument at a high volume, are at risk of permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high noise levels may unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way", admits Meglena Kuneva.
'The scientific findings' continues the Leader's 'make clear the risk and the need to act quickly.
The most important thing is that we have to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding so that they become fully effective and keep pace with new technology.'
Brussels has requested an Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
'The scientists  concluded the EU executive  confirm that there is cause for concern and now the European Commission will examine together with the other Member States and parties that raised the problem what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices.'
There is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about the damage to hearing that can be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is very possible to limit these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the European Scientific Committee states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise level in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem is expected to affect 5-10% of users of such devices and could be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves the Commission for the Future of the Capital
We start today, close in March, we'll have the sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", who met this morning at their new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will prepare a manual for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the city council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and its councillor Gianni Alemann.
'The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas. It will have to make proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Giunta e the City Council.
It's not a change of function, but just an attempt to have some place to work on a big project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have a precise time frame.
In June,  the Mayor announces  we will present a strategic plan and build on the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital city of Rome".
To those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary in that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission is able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of the quality of the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure they are in Rome, her contribution will be decisive.
Too often politics is divided into everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasise that 'this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, the citizens of Rome will not even cost the euro and will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence the capital has.'
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor static, in order to allow our city to rise authentically to the level it needs and to think in a united spirit about its future".
A future which, the mayor of Rome said, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look much further" not only in the option of a future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president".
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as a private citizen today) with the enemy of Islam".
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on the Web: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama has the audacity to think he's going to get to the top of the nation, which has had all the help of two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks don't say much; they're clearly racially motivated attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there's the polls; everyone says Obama will win, and with a big lead.
Even so, there are those who act according to the heart and not the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, commented: "For once in the voting booth, we know well who the American patriot will vote for".
A side of the American mentality that remained untouched until the last moment is coming to the surface.
Say what you want, and we'll figure out who to cross out, whether it's Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, seeming almost certain success for a black candidate.
But despite all these considerations, the main weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people, what mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89 percent said, "Iraq".
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
4,500 soldiers lost their lives in Iraq, and the Americans were not forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq became a weakness for most Bushes.
Whoever takes Georgie W's place will have a huge task to perform.
The economic collapse of the United States was felt by the press: there was a period of inquiry in the newspapers, and many blamed the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The Pew Research Center asked 500 journalists about their profession and their expectations for the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say that they were less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of the destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that must be solved if we are not to see a fundamental change in traditional journalism as understood by the general public.
There is a clear but complex pessimism permeating the American press.
Six out of ten press reporters and senior executives believe that journalism is going the wrong way nationally.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, which many see as the "killer" of print.
The "economic pressure" that journalists point out has increased by as much as 79 percent.
Five hundred journalists surveyed admitted that they turn to technology in the hope that it will "do good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms -- that's the executives -- and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with job security for someone.
Of executives who think they'll lose their jobs in three years, nationally, it's 47%.
As for the journalists, they're moving to 30%.
As for "certain work" regarding staff in America, it's still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it is a matter of take or leave.
Executives are almost always paid huge salaries, and an editor can make as much as $10,000 a month, apart from pension and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, until it reaches 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often get sick within a year.
It's just a matter of climate.
The Court in Rome, the Danilo Coupla is built in the Grottaferrata
The president of the second criminal chamber of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be allowed to move from his hometown, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer for the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During his trial at his own expense, he was released last week from house arrest, which was converted to permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate entrepreneur be allowed to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which the PM spoke) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon was already evident a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan put forward by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
As confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, more moderate, welcoming to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to those in Washington and the financial world, strong in the central states and the South.
The soul that arrogantly voted, the one I spoke of at the beginning...
But this is just one example of the change, the big change, that the current economic earthquake is already showing, not just in the United States, but across the West, and maybe not just here.
In both the US and Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator for phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, that are consolidating in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactivation, the extraordinary revival of the market, the dual category of the State-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which of course have strong ties abroad, but which are primarily concerned with the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
Which also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, who are also voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of the game or to have little to add: the clear evidence is the European Union, which is as always divided between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide on a single political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the individual state government, the bailout, the market revival, the new rules and, most importantly, the distribution of funds: the moment we get into a crisis, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources to be able to try and make things right.
And they also have the necessary means and the authority to use them: two resources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of to the same extent.
This new emphasis on the national-state element, which the crisis is placing, is in full accord with the increasing importance which recent economic progress is attempting to attach to a factor closely linked to it: territorial ownership.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the satya, the increasingly sophisticated technology, the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, out of nowhere we realized that our future would have to contend increasingly with such little immaterial things as water, grain, oil.
All the things that would be said can be transported from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case absolutely connected to a confined space, a territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler is sure to have a lot more cards on his sleeve than whoever isn't and who is unlucky enough to live in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second news, which is predicting a disaster.
When you talk about territory, state, government, you're inevitably talking about politics, which is leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena seem to be emerging.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, the demand for someone who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discrediting of existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which has proven equally inadequate and full of dark spots.
And together, something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: the discredit, impatience, sense of incompetence and absence that is trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that there is a growing belief among the masses that their actions are not the same as the ideas of the elite, the way they feel and are, their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite are out of their time and indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership is simply feeding one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to eliminate the ruling classes and the traditional political order is manifested in sudden electoral "struggles" or in unexpected changes in collective mood in recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of the Labour Party in Britain to the uprising of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the right-wing victory in Italy has something to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, are having increasing problems understanding, that is, representing, what, not today, is being created in the deepest layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is again intensifying, spreading, potentially overwhelming.
It would be an exaggeration to speak of a permanent "mass uprising" before that.
But we can't say that means keeping our eyes wide open.
Super glue for walking on walls.
To overcome the laws of gravity with super glue and walk the walls like Spider-Man in the future.
This is the subject of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists have managed to hold a 100 kilogram body glued to a vertical wall with a label that is only one square inch [2.5 cm].
STUDY  The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material the team has invented is an evolution of existing materials that use a special carbon structure called a carbon-dwarf tube.
"The base of the glue can be thought of as a series of tubes laid out like an orderly heap of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers were inspired by the gecko's legs, which are covered in microscopic hairs that allow the animal to make perfect attachments.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, showed that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and "just sticks off the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary glue", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe walking on walls like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers are thinking about a much less fascinating use as a link in electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering .
No superheroes at the moment.
 The University of California, Berkeley, is also researching a new glue.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a glue made of hair-like microfibers that cleans itself of dust by moving across the surface to maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their ingestion changes to increase or decrease their effectiveness with serious health consequences.
To highlight the risks of juices, both ready-made and fresh, when combined with certain medications, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, is raising a new alarm at the 263rd national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: One glass of grapefruit, orange, and apple juice can reduce the intake of some life-saving medicines, negate their benefits, and put patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
THE MEDICAL IN RISK The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a newsletter two years ago, urging doctors and patients to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful about what they drink if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
Not Grapefruit  Experts also say that orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of effects, butchered by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruby, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative labels of the medicines you receive, and if you encounter something unclear, do not be alarmed, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification", stressed the expert for the ANSA.
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Caucasian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political moves.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of its implications for the history of the United States, far more important than the first.
A prediction that caused much controversy and was blamed on him for years, but which proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public eye", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenz Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, Krugman is "an economist of great importance" but also a popularizer with "a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration".
Open Office, we have the third release of the anti-Microsoft package.
Today is the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal development suite that aims to reach more and more users, from the home to the office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more common Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is being released to the general public with various new features: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window are being supplemented by more substantial features such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document even with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some models have interesting features, such as allowing the size of a PowerPoint presentation to be reduced, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility of transferring a PDF file to a graphical model and retaining the original appearance of the page.
Still, from this perspective, we can create "hybrid PDF" documents that are similar to typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a spreadsheet or text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to comments to make identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on porting some of the Open Office functionality to the cloud, and they should be rebuilding the final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, and has been added to the English version, which is available on Mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the package is also available for Linux as usual.
The installation CD can also be sent to the home or workplace upon request.
And if the theme of free can be a catalyst for home expansion, it is in the commercial area that the Open Office package is investing heavily, and it can already count on a wide variety of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
There is also a wide range of training, consultancy and support services, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business opportunities.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for writing video replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that is aiming to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now at almost 3.600,000, with the release of the new version, it is possible that this number could be surpassed.
The results of the Coke are positive, too. It's the fourth case of doping.
A new case in the latest Tour de France: the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third-placed and winner of the best climber's jersey.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider to test positive for the Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples are consistent with those taken in recent weeks by the Losann and Chatenay-Malabry labs.
If the control analysis confirms the positive result for Cerro, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and face the stipulated two-year disqualification.
The report of Kohl's positive for third-generation EPO was confirmed by the head of France's anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press he had already informed the Austrian government authorities of the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian was the first to win the stage behind Spain's Carlos Sastro and American Cadel Evans, and he also won the points-based top-flight jersey.
Is Italy a racist country?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only in the last house become the preferred target of immigrants" who are welcomed with resistance.
Is it turning a beautiful country into a nation of racists? asks a long article in the New York Times, which focused this article on the debate over racism in Italy, starting with the case of a young man, Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are simultaneously the ones with "more integration and more work" but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the rising tensions between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation demanded by the Legislature, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rentals - up to €900 per room
The market for student housing is not in crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost up to 900 euros to rent in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples, 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that whole classes of students have lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices their families would have to pay", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "In this city, the high demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has stimulated a process of price increases that has spread to residents".
In most cases, the lease offers contain several infringements: free-standing contracts, unregistered, no-limit lease, and the associated sub-leases.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices through tax reform.
If we look at the details of the research, we see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, the cost per bed is about 450 euros, for a single room, from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere area) to a median price of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum price of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence, the average cost of a bed is 350-400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, it costs €250/280 per bed in a double room, from €370 to €500 in a single room.
In Rome, in the central university areas (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they charge about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double.
The prices are slightly lower (€550 per bed) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only way we're going to save money is if we move to the outskirts: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single room in the Prenestina, Centocelle and so on zones.
In Naples, beds cost €300 to €450, and rooms €400 to €600, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of the citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is the rent for students from outside the European Union, another anomaly is finally being recorded: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they charge for foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic halls
The historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without a cinema is like a blind man, a face without eyes".
The film, by Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in the major Italian urban centres as well as in the rural towns.
The process of restricting theatres, the birth of large multi-purpose halls in the suburbs and the subsequent extinction of single-purpose halls in the central areas of cities, is one of those events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the hallmarks of a true cultural crime.
Often, historical places full of memories disappear, "it's like losing a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the journey and a lot of emotions", feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Tornator Oscar and the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes 20 years ago, and which tells the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness of a way of life that cinema seems to have lost forever.
The figures obtained by Anec, the main operator association, speak for themselves: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinema theatres have closed their doors, with the highest costs being borne by the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 fewer in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 fewer in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna is first with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplexing, are the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian process has developed irrationally", says Paolo Protti, President of Anec",it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones survive, because when one cinema in a city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
Not to mention the insufficient subsidy to the fund in favour of operators: the previous public debt is around EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical standpoint, it is a shame that the government does not respect the existing laws.
The sector would need between €16 and €18 million a year to support it.
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to be concerned about closures and to have decided to find a solution by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historic centres and suburbs.
The planned rules include tax relief measures for operators and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to enter restricted traffic zones and will have special prices for stops and certain parking lots.
'I like this initiative,' says Giuseppe Tornatore, 'and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by introducing other measures'.
But what is certain is that to be able to stand up to the great power of multiplexing, traditional theatres must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audiences are more demanding.
Defending traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: closing the Super Cinema in Bagheri, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to start the New Cinema Paradiso, which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk past the now-closed Rialt or Quirinal on the Nazionale, where I've shared so many emotions that I don't have to look at the black-dust signs, I turn the other way.
Political links with the mafia group 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioia Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group".
The charges brought by the Directorate of Anti-Mafia in Calabria against the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Gioia, Giorgio Tauro, Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the Mayor of Rosarna, Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external cooperation with a mafia organization, are grave.
Also in handcuffs are Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson the lawyer, the boss's namesake, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense", state prosecutors wrote, when two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Piromalli's lawyer.
"Thus, mafia groups would be allowed to formally enter the city government and facilitate the already vast possibilities of control and management of public administration".
The president of the Calabria Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "there are many secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndranghet, heroes who are still unblemished".
This morning's arrests follow the arrests in July last year, which police have shown the Piromalli mafia group has taken a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the Gioii Tauro City Council had been dissolved since 1991, due to the supposed link between organized crime and local government - local politicians have been stripped of their municipal office.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of the centre-right coalition after a narrow election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the municipal council to be dissolved.
He called the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marc Minniti to account and accused him of plotting for political reasons, but in the arrest warrant signed this morning, the judges explain that the mafia group even went so far as to request a change to the A3 motorway project.
Further interrogations ordered against Dal Torrión, the prosecutors write, revealed "a willingness to shift the claims of the businessman, a representative of some larger group very close to Piromalli, as is commonly known, and to adapt the elections of the public administration to the interests of the mafia group".
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It's an endless deposit that covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, which have caught the eye of giants like Chevron, who are now trying to reach out to these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea-movements has been studied for over a hundred years, and research intensified in the 1970s in connection with the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of using offshore energy went sideways, but now environmental organizations and the new oil price increase have given the sector a new boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London stated in 2007 that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by using the movement of the ocean waves.
That would be twice the amount of energy that is currently produced in nuclear power plants.
Plus, there's the tides and the tides and the tides.
The giants are attacking.
the company that invested in offshore energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of investing in offshore energy, more and more companies are investing in offshore energy over traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies", a spokesman for a company connected to the oil colossus of the United States told the Wall Street Journal, "and they're considering working with us".
The collaboration we're considering is to get the permit from the U.S. Energy Commission that's necessary to start a marine energy project in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially when we consider that Alaska is where the U.S. continues to drill for oil, and recently President Bush came up with a plan to drill again.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also tracking the offshore energy footprint and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, show, according to observers, growing interest.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For the time being, the installations in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not appear to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
But to produce more energy, we need to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of beams that are interconnected.
The force of the wave moving up and down the buoys is converted by means of cylinders and cylinders into the hydraulic pressure inside the buoys.
The pressure will dissolve the turbine that supplies power to the generator.
Power is being delivered to shore by submarine cables.
Four of these facilities are currently in the design phase, pending federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
In contrast, Verdant Power already generates power for the mall and parking lots using six offshore turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during tides and floods causes the turbines to rotate, which in turn powers the generator.
Verdant has expressed that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations for the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide, after the tide.
The tidal potential is of particular interest at this time, say the Electric Power Research Institute.
Although they are a non-contiguous factor, tides and currents are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is tidal power that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are forecasting up to $35 million in 2009.
