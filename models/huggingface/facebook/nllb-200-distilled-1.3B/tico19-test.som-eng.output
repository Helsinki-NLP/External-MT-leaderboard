Rapid spread of overall cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The overall incidence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, whereas at different stages depending on the country, the global COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience gained in Italy, countries, hospitals and emergency care units should increase their preparedness to follow up with COVID-19 patients who require medical care, especially emergency care.
On 31 December 2020, a group of cases of tuberculosis of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the cause of the new coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Until recently, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection was called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence is that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild pain, such as respiratory tract infection or with no signs of cancer, and usually recover.
In 14% of cases, COVId-19 progresses to severe illness requiring treatment while the remaining 6% of cases deal with serious illness requiring urgent care.
The mortality rate of patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the changes in all COVID-19 cases in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy during the period of 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom UK
Then China, COVID-19 has spread to a larger geographic area and the rate of COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world is now similar to that in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On 5 March 2020, in Eurosurveilance, Spiteri et al. reported the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the World Health Organization.
Within the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), the first three confirmed cases were reported on 24 January 2020 from a person returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in all 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), while between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported in Italy alone.
Find out the total number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country in the world, detected from only official sources such as the Commonwealth health ministries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization, is reported daily at 8:00 am.
This information was used to assess COVID-19 trends within the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare with those in Italy.
As the lead data source for COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day shortened incidence of total COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We have presented the total number of detected cases in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy for the period of January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day trends in the overall COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK are generally in the Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Across the EU/EEA and the UK, the overall incidence of COVID-19 cases began to increase around 21 February and now increased rapidly around 28 February 2020 (Helpful Tea).
This is due to the rapid spread of the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK are showing an increasing trend in the total number of COVID-19 cases (Helpful Tea).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy from 31 January-15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK have already announced a total number of cases comparable to that in Italy just 2 weeks ago or less.
Our results show that the number of identified COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed changes in the overall incidence of COVID-19 suggest that this global disease is spreading at a comparable rate in all countries.
This comes as countries differ in standards, national public health responses vary, and the possibility of defining different cases in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including adaptation testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed the emergency care unit while media sources reported that hospitals and medical equipment in these regions had reached the maximum capacity.
Data on the registration of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or the emergency department are currently available only at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
It should, however, be collected in a systematic manner to replace the current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed widespread variation in access to emergency care and central care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in the Portuguese community.
This means that countries can have either more or less income than Italy (12.5 urgent care and central care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
The design phases related to healthcare scale integration, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK member country for prioritizing hospitalized COVID-19 cases with a > 90% risk of overcrowding of the emergency care bed volume, are outlined in the sixth update of the ECDC COVID-19 Emergency Risk Assessment.
Since the number of cases is increasing in some regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and emergency departments that normally serve a specific regional integration community, information on cases and emergency care beds should be made available as a priority in the NUTS-2 statistical nomenclature.
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the global COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and emergency care units must prepare for the stage of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care, and especially emergency care, as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As noted in the recent rapid risk assessment, a rapid, effective and comprehensive response is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a controlled approach to a mitigated one, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt to their response accordingly if not implemented early.
The rapid risk assessment also includes measures of public health to reduce the impact of the global disease.
There is little chance that countries with the potential to increase their containment efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a significant increase in the number of patients requiring urgent care in the coming days or weeks.
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Similar to its similar virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also cross the spinal cord and cause similar symptoms through a similar process.
However, COVID-19 has a lower incidence and mortality than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more adults than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a comprehensive and timely overview of the topic of rapidly evolving research.
We cover the basics of epidemiology, the origin of diseases, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction of the causes of diseases, and disease prevention.
While there are still many questions that need answers, we hope this perspective will help us understand and reduce the consequences of this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were told to stay home for the entire holiday for weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic disease began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovering and more than 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is "society's number one enemy" and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, origin study, diagnosis, and treatment since it was first reported on January 7, 2020 which showed the sequence of how the virus was isolated in several patients.
This edition attempts to summarize the research progress in the newly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Disease (MERS, which broke out in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in terms of the prevention and prediction of pain as well as other remaining and urgent questions.
CoVs have traditionally been known as non-lethal infections, causing about 15% of all cases of leprosy.
However, in this century, we have encountered two major human pathogens, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries with serious ill health and death.
Therefore, COVID-19 is now the third recorded CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of colubrid bacteria whose origins are unknown were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 by the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death in Wuhan was reported.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, states and countries.
On January 20, a healthcare worker infection was reported, suggesting that human transmission is possible.
On January 23, Wuhan was placed under curfew with all public transportation suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan which is believed to be the source of the infection from unknown sources.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread to China and nearly 50 countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation changes so rapidly, the ultimate extent and severity of the outbreak is in the hands of the people.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-clinical study conducted on 8,866 patients including 4,021 COVID-19 confirmed patients showed a much updated picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UIBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but most are between the ages of 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the victims were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 victims were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread to groups mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from diagnosis to diagnosis.
The average retention period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive rate (RO) was 3.77 (95% Cl: 3.51-4.05), and the modified RO was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases rose rapidly before 23 January 2020, as China's Spring Festival rush hour approached.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the modified mortality rate of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 202-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (>=60), and deteriorated collagen.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, multilayered viruses that contain a single RNA-sensitive strand.
They can be divided into four categories, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, which are known to occur in humans.
The membrane-bound S glycoprotein is secreted by the neurons angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane synthesis occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is released along with the membrane.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new variant of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genome identification in 10 consecutive trials collected at the first outbreak site, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through electron microscopy, droplets of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in a very thin part of the human respiratory membrane.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is much weaker at detecting ACE2 in humans than SARS-CoV, which is due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make a short abnormal protein with orf3b and a secreted protein with orf8.
orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral infection and inhibit IFNB expression; however, orf8 is not known to be active or active.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported a cryo-EM model of full-length ACE2 in humans where 2.9 A is the stressed amino acid conjugate of B0AT1.
They found that the enzyme, which opens and closes the receptors, binds to the enzyme as a weak enzyme and ADCE2-B0AT1 can bind to two S proteins, which are the identification markers for CoV and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in drug research to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and intermediate disease.
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have evolved from mosquitoes and were transmitted to humans through cats and camels respectively.
By comparing the biological genealogy of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the virus was identified as the original carrier of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-CoVs identified in the virus named as SARS-SL-CoVZX45 and SARS-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the carrier that helps the virus cross the biological barrier to infect humans is unknown, and the route it takes is still unclear.
Ji, et al., have alleged that snakes are carriers of the smallpox virus that contains a homologous protein S gene in humans.
According to a study, researchers in Gangzhou, China, suggested that the spider, a milk thinner throat gland that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine - is the most likely carrier of SARS-CoV-2 infection by infecting 99% of the CoV genes found in spider and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% variation spread across both genome data is still a large variation, so the combined results of the hard evidence are awaited (Figure 33).
The chemical mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar mechanisms.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to sunlight and 56C heat within 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethanol, a pesticide containing chlorine, paracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty compounds, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively remove the virus.
In general, all human societies have no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, there is no detailed study reported based on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to earlier studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4) 4).
Generally, after the virus attacks the host, the immune system first recognizes the body by a pattern of receptor recognition (PRR) including C-type lectin receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR) and RIG-l-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus causes inflammation, enlargement of dendritic nerve cells, and production of type I interferons (IFN yo) that control the spread of the virus and the rate of macrophage phagocoytosis of the viral antigen.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to escape the immune response.
Recently, the adaptive immune response has joined the fight against the virus.
White T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the immune system.
CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific anti-tumor virus immunity, and CD8+ T cells which directly kill infected virus cells.
Helper T cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines to help the immune system.
However, the CoV can inhibit T cell functions that cause T cells to die.
Human immunity, including antibodies such as C3a and C5a and anti-fungals, are also fundamental to combating viral infections.
For example, anti-tuberculosis products from a recovered patient mediated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, over-interaction with the immune system creates a lot of cells that work locally in tandem that can cause serious damage to the heart and other organs, and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is classified as a continuous grouping, is more likely to be transmitted to older people with pre-existing illnesses and pregnant women.
It is normal for people who are susceptible to a large number of viruses or who have a functioning immune system that is not elevated to have a higher chance of contracting an infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases indicates that the average length of daycare was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, indicates that the duration of care was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days according to the statistics of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to establish effective and long-term quarantine in the care facility, which prevents the transmission of the virus to other people from people who are not showing symptoms.
As a rule, susceptible people, or those who have the virus, usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Can the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and first symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, lethargy, headache, arthritis, excessive sweating, sore throat, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea.
Some patients had shortness of breath and low oxygen levels within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient develops rapidly with symptoms of severe respiratory distress, inflammation of the one-bladed valve, sedentary acidity and bleeding.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if there are no cardiovascular disorders, should be screened for the virus promptly.
A statistical study conducted in late December 2019 showed that epilepsy symptoms were 98% fever, 78% cough, 55% shortness of breath, and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group where the group caused transmission of the disease from a person without symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 statistical study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them need respiratory aids, with more COVID-19 patients and the risk of MERS deaths being constant compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and arthritis (21%) we also saw patients with MERS.
Among SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-2%), diarrhea (20%-25%) and arthritis (13%-25%) were identified as the main symptoms and respiratory support was estimated at 14%-20% of patients.
On February 14, COVID-19 deaths were 2% of the 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS deaths in November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
As for MERS, according to a study statistics from June 2012, the mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study showed that the R0 for SARS-CoV was higher than 6.47 with a 95% confidence point (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV was only rated from 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV-2 and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality, and R0 are presented in Table1.1.
Higher figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher transmission potential compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but a lower mortality rate than the latter.
As a result, it is very difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compared to others such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Current groupings usually take place in the same family or in one place or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients who have had a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or who have been in contact with infected people or patients within the two weeks prior to the current outbreak.
However, it has been reported that people can be infected with the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and treated patients discharged from hospital may be infected again, raising concerns about extending the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or decreased number of red blood cells (especially red blood cells) in the early stages.
For example, a decrease in white blood cell count <4×109/L including white blood cell count 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and verimia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The level of liver and muscle fluid and myoglobin in the blood increased in some patients, and the high-reactive protein C and red blood cell concentration increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimmer, decreased production of fibrin in the blood, is elevated, and the white blood cell count is significantly reduced.
Imaging defects of the wrist were found in many COVID-19 patients with characteristic small male cones or lack of luminescence in the heart.
Patients often have a concussion, severe heart damage, or severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled swelling, fluid buildup, and growing tumors can seriously impair respiration.
Type I and type II pneumocytes malfunction decreases the rate of dementia and also increases the area of stress, which in turn decreases the ability of the heart to expand, indicating a risk of heart death.
So the worst results of this imaging
On February 18, 2020, laboratory analysis of COVID-19 showed the destruction of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, and interaction of white blood cells, and multicellular syncytial cells in the heart of a patient who died from the disease, and the regularity of laboratory tests for viral infections and ARDSIs similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high cost of false positives, which can accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, clinical indications began to be used in tests (which are not particularly reliable with RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred in the SARS case.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the diagnosis, clinical signs, laboratory tests and imaging results are fundamental and indispensable to make the diagnosis effective.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's team described a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, detecting the synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments from 20 x 10- 18mol/L to 200 x 10- 18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter sample) using a long rod in less than one hour without the need for large equipment.
Hopefully, the new technology could suddenly improve sensitivity and usability if confirmed in clinical trials.
Due to a lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors can often only provide COVID-19 patients with supportive care, while trying different treatments that have already been used or suggested before treatment for other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and viral diseases (Table (Table20.2).
The therapist includes the possibility of now being treated with antiviral medications, immune-controllers, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is proposed to be used as medicine.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the heart in the early stages and also infects the lower capacity, other ACE2-specific organs, the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and death are the main fears of patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is a life-saving and potentially symptom-relieving option that includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, no ventilation, and mechanical ventilation depending on the risk of infection.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supplemented with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an upgraded technique of endovascular endoscopy used to treat life-threatening coronary artery disease or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating high-grade infections and cell-deactivating infections, and protecting the function of key neurons are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It was found that cytokine storm is caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic pain response that is triggered by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the immune cells to release a large number of radical ions that are the main cause of ARDS and multi-cellular retirement.
Lowering the immune system is fundamental for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in weakened patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumb, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokine activation.
Other immunotherapy inhibitors of cytokine activity include direct T cell inhibition of immune responses; IFN-y, IL-1, and TNF inhibition; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine inhibition indicating 4; and HDAC inhibition.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of the painful injury.
However, the over-dosed steroids were not beneficial for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause other serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, significantly affecting the prognosis of the disease.
Similarly, short-term low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids are recommended to be used with caution in patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms.
At the time of writing, there are no effective antiviral treatments that have been proven.
However, the intravenous drug with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be successful in US patients with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead and previously approved for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Finally, remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other RNA-linked viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has brought China to the site to conduct a series of tests on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with highly anticipated results.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are proposed as potential treatments for patients with symptoms of severe respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, heart damage, and more severe reactions may occur with the combination therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other medicines used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and generation of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have high levels of antibodies that protect against infection in their blood.
The antibodies are immunoglobin (Ig) produced by the white blood cell B to fight infections and other foreign substances and recognize specific gravity in the infection and kill it directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms resolved within 24 hours, along with reduced inflammation and increased viral activity and oxygen levels in the blood.
However, clarification and definition are important to suggest a widely used method before a specific treatment is developed.
In addition, some of the side effects of the given treatment are neglected.
For example, anti-inflammatory drugs can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release signals, potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The body's antibodies are low, and the plasma requirement is high to treat sick patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific anti-toxins quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
For this reason, it is difficult to directly remove B cells from recovered patients and to verify the genetic code of the virus by inserting effective anti-tumor drugs or screens with effective anti-tumor drugs that can fight the underlying viral protein.
In this way, we can estimate the anti-fouling output.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effectiveness is largely dependent on the combination of mutations in the pathogen based on TCM concepts.
The most effective ingredients are often unknown or very rare and difficult to produce and test for such ingredients or the best combination.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become the main treatment option for patients who have mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe levels.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rate of medication for COVID-19 treatment was seen in many provinces of China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only 30% of its COVID-19 patients, received the lowest rate of medication (13%).
However, this is a very poor comparison as other factors such as the number of patients and risk must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time your body takes to recover from heat, symptoms, and treatment was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM alone group.
Interestingly, the rate of worsening in people with symptoms (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group (7.4 percent versus 46 percent) and the mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the MW group (8.8 percent versus 39 percent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still awaits highly controlled trials in multiple ways and multiple facilities.
It will also be interesting to characterize the mechanical effects of the technique and to prove the effectiveness of TCM therapeutic ingredients or their combination if possible.
Suspected or COVID-19 patients often face a great fear of the highly contagious disease and even death from the disease, and people in quarantine also face boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, inflammatory symptoms such as fever, lack of oxygen in the body, and cough as well as severe side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause severe anxiety and fainting.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, psychiatric conditions including persistent monologue, anxiety, fear, background mental illness, parental symptoms, neurological disorders and even suicide have been reported.
Compulsory contact and quarantine, as part of public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the pandemic, and more critical of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, and people who have had contact with them as well as adults who need it.
The laboratory testing agenda should include the creation of integrated mental health teams, clear communication on outbreak awareness and consistent and transparent SARS-CoV-2 treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and the implementation of one-to-one contact precautions.
Effective vaccines are fundamental to combating the chain of transmission from the source of infection to the susceptible pathogen and often increase the treatment of the virus by controlling the infectious disease caused by the emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on S-protein to produce long-lasting and potent anti-dust and/or anti-SARS-CoV immunity.
Vaccines against the virus are being evaluated in an animal strain of SARS.
However, the efficacy of the vaccine in older people and at-risk groups and the protection against viral infection in animals have yet to be determined before clinical trials can begin.
This is because SARS was eliminated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported so far.
In comparison, the rare cases and outbreaks of MERS are likely to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions with no permanent cure within those areas.
A vaccine strategy for MERS has been developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, vector genetic material, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and small protein-unit combinations, some of which have been evaluated in animal units.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people with inadequate immunity is urgent and a difficult task to control the ongoing outbreak.
However, it is difficult to overcome the complications due to the long time (average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the existing variants of the CoV.
Like a new disease, COVID-19 has only just begun to show up in the public eye from comprehensive medical examinations of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually from the absence of pre-existing symptoms.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also a disease associated with an increase in additional cases and deaths of patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a mental health care approach is the basis for health care institutions to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the medical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be related to the health care perception of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in causing SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mostly occurs in the age group of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as mentioned above.
Patients requiring urgent care were more likely to have previously dealt with other chronic illnesses and conditions and were significantly older than those without (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting age is a factor in the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0./100,000 versus 0.27/100,000) as noted above.
In the emergency room, patients are more likely to have severe heart damage and abnormal heartbeat.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause cardiac retirement in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and chronic disease are closely linked and can interfere.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of the cell disease or injury and is suggested as a factor in possible pain causes, treatment reactions, and ultimately recovery.
The relationship between CRP levels and the severity and cause of COVID-19 disease was also suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in several blood vessels, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during cell injury.
Therefore, it is a traditional sign of cardiac or hepatic retirement.
The main medical symptoms: chest radiation and the timing of the onset of the medical symptoms should be considered along with other factors to predict the outcome and the severity of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as mentioned above, steroids are immune-suppressing agents that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of painful injury.
As heavy corticosteroid medication was widely used in SARS patients, many of those who recovered suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with long-term disability and decreased quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Brain tumors: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffered from the same excessive speech as they were often in long periods of quarantine and in excessive isolation and witnessed the deaths of their closest family members and patients' friends.
It is important to provide psychological counselling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the disorder and return to a normal life.
According to the statistical studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different disease states than SARS.
In addition to spreading in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also spreads efficiently in the upper respiratory tract causing no or mild symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause acne.
Therefore, patients who have been infected early or for an unknown period of time can produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which causes a greater difficulty in controlling the infection.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV has been found to occur when patients are very ill, while transmission usually does not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Major efforts are currently underway in China including curbs in Wuhan and nearby cities and ongoing quarantines of almost all communities in an effort to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these actions have caused significant damage to the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a decline in infectiousness.
The most optimistic forecast is that the recession will end by the end of March and that the recession will last for 3-4 months.
However, other experts do not see it that way.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be somewhat more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
The pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect one-third of the global population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in both nasal and throat fluids of recovered patients who were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be a circulatory event similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have emerged in China in light of the decline in the number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may have worked.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases and another half million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in its transmissibility and eventually die or become a micro-infectious virus that can survive with humans.
Comparison of COVID-19 epidemics to SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted mainly through cough and sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with objects infected by the virus.
The virus was also detected in feces, which creates a new possibility of it crossing feces into the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases said that 41% of the cases were likely caused by nosocomial infection, including 17 patients with pre-existing illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, friends, as well as bystanders who have had contact with the patient or the infected person.
The first protective measure to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a face mask; both the use of a surgical mask and a N95 (series #1860) respiratory mask help to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical mouth masks prevent fluid droplets from a person who may have contracted the infection from a flight or from touching a surface where it is not transmitted to another person.
However, only N95 (series #1860) mouth masks can protect against the absorption of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm during respiration, with only 5% of the virus able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of both wavelengths and is approximately 85 nm.
Since small particles can pass through even five surgical mouthguards, healthcare providers who deal directly with patients are obliged to wear N95 (series #1860) mouthguards but not surgical mouthguards.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers must wear protective clothing to reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can enter a person's eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask, possibly getting the virus through his eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers must wear protective masks or goggles when working with patients.
People in affected or potentially affected areas are strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more than ever, to stay at home to avoid self-isolation and to reduce contact with people who may have been infected.
Three areas have been identified as the most suitable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, it is very similar to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 and has caused great concern in China based on the deep memory of the deadly SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control has not released the information to the public stating that the new virus has a reduced ability to spread and control reproduction among humans and that this is not a problem to prevent and stop the disease.
The message significantly eased public concern, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and a crucial time was canceled to contain the disease at a minimum in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agencies may take this hard lesson and make major breakthroughs in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more careful when making public announcements as any word to the public can change their feelings and judgments; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from healthcare facilities than they would be waiting for official reports from doctors and authorities; (3) more restrictions to prevent the potential spread of the epidemic in its early stages than attempts to disseminate it to the public; and (4) in addition to distributing targeted and useful materials to increase public awareness of the epidemic and to test and promote an early response process in the community.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to over 50 countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar to COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS resurgence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are fundamental to curbing the spread and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women, and the risk and mortality rate is also higher among older people than younger people.
SARS has a much higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even without any symptoms whereas SARS patients did so when they were very ill, which causes a greater problem in stopping the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is more rapidly and extensively spread than SARS-CoV.
A regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA test may be infection-free in some cases of COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated can recover from the disease.
The results suddenly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
In light of the rapid development of COVID-19 tests, many complex issues will be resolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS strains of CoVs has been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a strain.
What animal is the intermediate organism in the transmission of a disease from a parasite, say a mosquito, to a human?
Without knowing the answers #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission and the outbreak can get worse at any time.
Although modeling and chemical tests showed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter the cell cycle and cause rapid test mutations?
Does the virus detect ACE2 that defines other immune cells?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the flu last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?
Will it be a global pandemic, a global pandemic, a pandemic like SARS or a worse pandemic like the flu?
It is important, but it may take time to find answers to these and other questions.
However, at all costs, we have no choice but to stop this global pandemic as soon as possible and return life to normal.
The origin of human-to-animal coronavirus
Genetic mutation and adaptation have brought the coronavirus (CoV) and its disease carriers, including humans, together for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human-infected CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the symptoms of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed the narrative to reflect how life-threatening and life-threatening HCoV infection is.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 again reduced the chances of CoVs and surprised us with its extremely high transmission capacity but slowed the spread compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection (HCoV) is a disease transmitted from animals to humans.
Most HCoVs are derived from viruses but not from infectious ones.
Central vector disease that stores some HCoVs is also known as.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of CoV carriers in animals can also provide important insights into the development of CoV disease in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the knowledge available about seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their origin and transmissions within the organism.
Importantly, we compare and contrast the differences between HCoVs from the concepts of viral evaluation and genetic synthesis.
The current CoV 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions required for successful transfection and final decisions on the virus risk assessment of the disease are also mentioned.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of genetically modified, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses are home to the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases of RNA viruses named "CoV" due to the biological structure when viewed under a microscope.
By design, CoVs have a non-dividing gene to share with a single organism.
Approximately two-thirds of the host gene is composed of two main message-reading cells (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1b replicase polyprotein.
The polyprotein was reactivated to produce 16 non-structural proteins, modeled nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for protein structure, including spikes (s), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific sequence proteins have been inserted into the coagulation sites of different CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequence, CoVs are classified into four categories (alpha-CoV, bet-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), in which the bet-CoV category contains most HCoVs and is further divided into four primary types (A, B, C and D).
Evidence from genealogical studies showed that bats and mice are the carrier genes of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the largest reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have crossed the species barrier and have emerged as important viruses for humans.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the newly discovered SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly virulent, causing severe lower respiratory infection in many patients with a higher risk of developing severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension.
The first HCoV-229E virus, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of flu patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained through in-depth studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause symptoms of dementia.
In fact, the topic was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and is one of the deadliest in recent history, affecting more than 8,000 people and the mortality rate was close to 10%.
After a decade, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has caused a permanent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula and has sporadically spread to the rest of the world.
The rare HCoV-nCOV 2019, which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the novel coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm was ringing and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have animal-borne disease traits from rodents, mice or domestic animals.
Several evidence measures support mutant lineage of all HCoVs from the virus, whereas the viruses adapted well and did not cause infection but showed significant genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed major health, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Research into the origin of animal-borne diseases of HCoVs provides a way to understand the natural history, driving forces and barrier factors for the evolution of a species.
This may also guide or facilitate the detection of stocks, intermediates and breeding animals for SARS-CoV-2 viruses, with important consequences for preventing further spread in the future.
In this review we present a summary of the gene sequence of animal-borne disease, transmission to other organisms and the process of disease progression of HCoV.
Specifically, we will highlight and discuss the general theme of the origin of HCoV viruses are typically non-infectious in biological terms in nature but become infectious after transmission from one organism to another.
We are also reviewing the direction of HCoV's evolution which increases transmission often comes as its virulence decreases.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed at this forum.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first detection of the HCoV-229E B814 virus in the nasal secretions of flu patients, various CoVs were quarantined in several infected animals, including beetles, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV detection by sequencing method (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E virus was detected in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infection in 1966, and was subsequently sequenced to grow in the lung cell layers of WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed flu symptoms, including headache, diarrhea, restlessness and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10-20% of cases.
In late 1967, HCoV-OC43 was discovered in cell culture and sequencing in the brain of mice.
The diagnostic symptoms of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are not characteristic of infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and rhino viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread around the world, and are more likely to be transmitted during the transition period of the tropical climate.
Generally, the period of inactivity is less than one week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to the human case study, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E had moderate fever.
Only a few patients with low immune systems showed severe inflammation of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "common cold", was first well documented as a global disease caused by HCoV in human history and the originator is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV has been identified.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS outbreak has resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
With the exception of the main transmitters, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two additional cases, during the symptom-free period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral activity on the 10th day of illness.
Patients with SARS-CoV first have muscle pain, headache, fever, sluggishness and chills, followed by respiratory distress, cough and respiratory problems later in life.
Hypoglycemia, liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory problems with SARS.
The spread of alveolar vessels, proliferation of body pores and the increase of macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% will eventually need emergency medical care and ventilation.
In addition to lowering the respiratory tract, many organs including the intestinal tract, heart and kidney can also become infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by the release of cytokines, which may be dangerous especially in patients with a low immune system.
The virus was first isolated from open lung tests taken from nearby patients who had travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, many efforts have been made to conduct scientific studies on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands during late 2004.
It was previously found to be more prevalent in young children, the elderly and patients with low immune systems and respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of nasal mucus inflammation, swelling of the gums, fever, and respiratory tract inflammation are common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study identified the quarantine of the same disease with nasal tubes taken from an 8-month-old boy with a bruise in the Netherlands.
Although it was first seen in the Netherlands, it actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring and autumn.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with neglected and binding bronchitis, also known as bronchitis.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man who was being treated for bronchitis and inflammation of the respiratory tract in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired infections and respiratory tract inflammation, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be accompanied by severe and worsening fever.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected worldwide, causing mild respiratory illnesses.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to grow and cause a highly contagious disease, although cases have occurred for unknown reasons but are rare among the most common strains of the HCoV-NK63 virus, which is now reported to cause severe infections of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when HCoVs require effective transmission capabilities and continue to exist in humans permanently, they become less toxic or more infectious.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the heart of a 60-year-old patient who had severe acute myocardial infarction and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the confirmed cases by laboratory tests originated in the Middle East, exported cases with additional transmission among contacts were reported from various European countries and Tunisia.
Another outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical signs of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by severe, highly progressive tumors.
Unlike MERS, many MERS patients have been diagnosed with renal failure, which is very different from MERS caused by HCoV infections.
More than 30% of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and constipation.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported to have a higher mortality rate of 34.4%, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to mankind.
During mid-to-late December 2019, groups of patients with measles who were found to be moderately resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of a lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern also known as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Interestingly, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the survival rate is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, manifested as fever, cough and lack of oxygen.
Diarrhoea was also observed in some patients.
A bruise is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to severe respiratory distress.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have many similarities with a nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they are divided into different types of mutation-specific genes.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less virulent but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects who do not show symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and classification of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs revealed significant similarities and differences.
Firstly, the period before and during the illness is very similar.
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 mimics the general mutations of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the risk of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community-transmitted HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-2229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, it has been observed during community-transmitted infections of HCoVs, including non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic introductions.
On the other hand, small fractions of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as cases of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is less well documented.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting characteristics common to both communities that receive both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs that are community-transmitted.
On the other hand, it has yet to be confirmed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it is transmitted to humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, other HCoV-like viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through oral excretions played a role as important as SARS-CoV cases, at least under some circumstances, remains to be confirmed in future studies.
Also of particular importance is the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may show temporal variation as community-acquired cases of HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, virulence and sustained spread after transmission to humans will be the final impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it may be true that humans have adapted well to the forty HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the ancient HCoV infection.
The HCoV that causes the most serious human disease and the most serious human HCoV infection have been eliminated.
For this to happen, it must multiply in humans at a rate sufficient to allow it to adapt to general developmental changes by fighting the inhibitory factors of disease.
In this sense, the longer the resistance to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the higher the number of infected people, are the greatest opportunities for better adaptation of the human race.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control other infections.
For years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circling the human environment, causing flu in people with healthy immune systems.
And viruses don't need a host animal.
In comparison, most SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses are not human-to-human and their human-to-human transmission is not well-controlled.
They want to preserve and spread their stocks of zoonotic diseases and look for opportunities to flow more into vulnerable human targets, using one or two intermediate routes and increasing the incidence of disease.
SARS-CoV-2 has symptoms similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-transmitted HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible as HCoVs have been acquired by the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more virulent than community-acquired HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it will be fully adaptable to humans and circulate between humans without stocks or animals as intermediate pathogens.
Before we discuss the animal origin of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the mutations, nature, storage, pathogenicity and neutrality of HCoVs.
The animal acts as a mutant host for HCoV if it provides a home to a primate that is closely related to it by sharing a high level of nucleotide sequence.
The previous virus was normally infectious and did not cause the disease.
Also, the virus pool provides HCoV with a permanent and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the infection was transmitted naturally and was a natural pathogen of HCoV or its derivative virus.
On the contrary, if the new HCoV is transmitted to a moderately active carrier shortly before or close to human transmission, the new carrier is usually not well-adapted.
A mild viral disease can be a source of zoonotic human-to-human infection and can play a role in reinforcing the viral disease by allowing the virus to multiply in a short time and then spread to humans to increase the spread of human infection.
HCoVs can also become infected later on if they cannot survive a moderate viral infection.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to a central vector and also organize in isolation for long periods of time.
In this case, the central pain vector becomes a natural pain vector.
Data from epidemiological studies have shown in a review that the first case of SARS was historically related to livestock.
A series of tests on the level of viruses showed that livestock traders had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV igG than the general population.
A covered wild cat (Paguma larvata) and a wild dog in a live animal market were first identified as carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that are very similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that SARS was not reported after killing all the cat flies in the market.
However, it has been reported that a covered wildcat in the air or on farms not exposed to live animal markets has largely disappeared from SARS-CoV, suggesting that a covered wildcat may be only a moderately potent carrier but not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that, as 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have immunity to SARS-CoV, the possibility that a few micro-mammal organisms may also be moderate and potent pathogens of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these seem to be the end of the SARS-CoV pathogen.
A series of searches for the natural pathogen SARS-CoV revealed a closely related strain of the CoV, known as SARS-related Phinolophus Cov strain HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the footwear of Chinese horse-drawn carriages.
These videos contain antibodies against SARS-CoV and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
Since other CoVs of the genus share 88-92% of the same nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV.
This study laid the groundwork for the new idea that the eyelids are a reservoir for emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) were also detected in the video, but none except one modified WIV1 can be identified as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converting fluid 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from fecal samples of the spider was found to be used by spiders, wild cats and ACE2 in humans as a neurotransmitter.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS was able to get rid of WIV1.
To some extent, WIV1 represents the first closely related strains of SARS-CoV found in the virus, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence in their genetic linkage.
Despite the great similarities between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the nearest origin of the SARS-CoV virus and the virus is not the nearest carrier of SARS-CoV.
Analysis of biological origin studies identifies MERS-CoV as a group similar to the CoV-HKU4 virus and the CoV-HKU5 virus.
The CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV co-infections use a single-sensor anti-inflammatory, dipeptidyl peptase 4 (DPP4), for the transmission of the virus.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of MERS-CoV is a tumor group that is similar to the beta-CoVs found in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in the wild.
MES-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the evening primates may not be the closest carrier of MERS-CoV infection.
On the other hand, a study in the Middle East shows that monokrustic camels have a unique MERS-CoV-mediated host cell, a camel native to the Middle East that is similar to many African countries.
MERS-CoV, a direct analog of the virus found in humans, was found in camels in studies, and camels have also been shown to be immune to MERS-CoV vectors.
It is also worth noting that generally mild symptoms but a large release of the virus have been observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels not only released the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal tract, which is the main route of infection.
However, questions remain as many confirmed MERS cases had no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving an unknown animal that hosted the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% genetic similarity with the nucleotide of the CoV RaTG13 strain isolated from the Rhinolophuw affinis strain.
As with the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also highly likely to determine parental relationship.
That is to say, the virus is not a host for the virus (s) of SARS-CoV-2 until similar viruses are found in the future.
It is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic animal is among the wildlife species that are bought and slaughtered in the Huanan SeaFood Market supermarkets, which neglected the first cases of COVID-19, indicating the true case of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies of the genetic sequence of the pathogen suggested that a group of small, dangerous mammals known as pangolins (Manis Javanica) may also be the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV lineage.
The new CoV from pangolins shares 85-92% of the genetic similarity in the nucleotide table with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally and very closely related to RatG13 in about 90% of the nucleotide sequence recognition.
They classify two sub-genera of SARS-CoV-2 as viruses in the recombinant process, one sharing a common receptor (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of amino acid identity.
The visual similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to RBD and RaTG13 is very different, although there is a high degree of genetic similarity in the broad genome chart.
A previous study on sick pangolins also reported the detection of a highly contagious virus in a sample taken from the heart, which turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study, which combined methods and manual therapy to extract a partial sequence of viral genes that comprised about 86.3% of the full length of viral genes, found that the virus was a viral virus.
We cannot rule out the possibility that he is a carrier of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present there is no evidence to directly link the origin of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins due to the sequential variation of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins which is related to beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolin related to beta-CoVs.
The pathway of SARS-CoV-2 mutation in bats, pangolins, and other mammals is still in its infancy.
While there were substantial genetic similarities in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and the spider, SARS-CoV-2 related to beta-CoV and RaTG13 share a broad genetic similarity.
There is a strong suspicion of similarities found in RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins related to beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 due to arbitrary selection of similar values.
Another proposal would prefer the re-combination of SARS-CoV-2 with a pangolin related to beta-CoV and RaTG13 and a third wild animal.
Driven by strong evaluation, recombination is becoming more prevalent in beta-CoVs.
The decision-making team is still missing the origin of the animal-to-human SARS-CoV-2 disease.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the origin of animal-to-human diseases of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HkU1 have also been studied.
Evidence from biology studies shows that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E both descended from CoVs in the wild, while the origin of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses was found in mice.
It was reported that the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infected with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-infection with the co-in.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another strain of the virus, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, where a camel strain was suspected to be a moderate pathogen.
As a demonstration, current knowledge of the animal origin of the identified HCoVs is summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of biology studies provided evidence that there are historical occurrences of inter-biological transmission of HCoVs.
When HcOV-OC43 was introduced into humans from a fire-dwelling animal in the late 1890s, a global respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E bio-transmission is well documented.
It was found that the alpha-CoV subtype is very closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Many people support the idea that the coronavirus should be transmitted directly to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, are the closest to interacting with the sunflowers in their shared habitat.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E associated with alpha-CoV and alpaca are different and have no pathogens in alpaca, while the alpaca-CoV that caused the outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals is not.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas could get HCoV-229E from human alpha-CoV is not excluded.
In fact, the spleen is the direct source of infectious human viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not very likely that the viruses can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Thus, while alpha-CoV and its receptors are the genetic counterparts of HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels with crows may be medium-dose carriers of the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of transmission from viruses to camels with a fever and from camels with fever to humans.
The mutated origin of MERS-CoV from the virus was known for its early identification and also reinforced the results of the study.
It is normal for the parasites to carry a large amount of viral material for interaction with the host organism by interacting with the genes and transmitting to the host organism.
Longevity, dispersed groups, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all ideal conditions for a virus to be a viable 'spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has infected camels with a crown within decades.
They've adapted well to these camels, which have gone from a moderate pain relief to a natural, permanent pain relief.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains very few mutations in these organisms.
Its intermittent human transmission is a disaster and humans are the ultimate carriers of MERS-CoV as its transmission is not viable.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of native species, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the beta-CoVs in the genome are highly pathogenic to the nationals.
They may be non-infectious beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 viruses, similar to wild cat SARS-CoV.
The rare possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to host organisms by animal to human is to be tested or excluded in future studies.
First, the fibers may be a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 related virus-borne pathogens that are often similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share their sensors with the environment through butchering or cooking.
Second, pangolins may be one of the aggravators of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
The virus is transmitted to humans through the access and consumption of predator meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2.
A general antibody test on domestic and wild animals is guaranteed.
Third, as mentioned above, the re-accumulation and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have been caused by a third species that was related to both the spiders and the nationalists.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Apart from the different species of animal carriers, the three main factors in the viral domain are also important in facilitating the crossing of CoVs across the barrier of the species.
First of all, there is a very high rate of RNA replication mutation.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation margin of CoVs can be classified as "medium" to "high" with an average mutation margin of ~10-4 mutations per year in 2 places, as part of the CoV adaptation phase of rare disease.
CoVs have exoribonuclease readability, a deletion that results from excessive mutation and decreased potency or lack of reproduction.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to slow down the reproduction of CoVs by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the CoV mutation threshold is almost a million times higher than that of the carriers of the disease.
In addition, the growth limit is often higher when CoVs do not cope well with disease.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation limit, the mutation limit of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, suggesting a higher degree of human adaptability.
Most likely, he had already contracted another disease that was very similar to human.
SARS-CoV-2 in addition, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to camels with a curved tail.
In theory, it is unlikely that the extinction of the genome will result in a vaccine and antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that are not effective quickly.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs extends additional modeling space to the genome modeling of mutations and assemblies, thereby increasing the chances of mutations in the organism, which is ideal for the emergence of abnormal CoVs when conditions become favorable.
This is supported by the available open source private reading formats and the functions of the proteins embedded at the end of the genome 3.
Third, CoVs often change structure indefinitely during RNA replication through a special "copy selection" process.
In a relapsing-remitting disease, the mutation occurs mainly during the replication of the CoV RNA.
The full-length and highly homologous genomic RNA in the lower RNA can recombine to form new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination in mutation studies has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as the SL-CoV virus and the CoV-HKU9 virus.
Interaction of viral infection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the pathogen is another important factor affecting transmission to the organism.
Here, the SARS-CoV re-accumulation is taken as a typical example, which has also shown evidence of good selectivity during the transmission stages of the species.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet quarantine SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation to different vectors, especially when accompanied by RBD mutations in the S protein.
In general, RBD in the S protein of the CoV is integrated into the cell's neurons and is strongly selective in response to the pathogenic antibody.
SARS-CoV, RBD gu is located at the 318th to 510th place in the amino acid sequence of the S1 subunit, which is located on the human ACE2 and is similar to the surface of the neurons in the virus's insertion.
The RBD SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, civets, mice and feral dogs, allowing the virus to pass through different organisms.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to differ in the viral sequence of human and wild cat RBD, and 4 of them are in the receptor design of the eardrum to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV from wild cats has mutations K479N and S457T in its RBD gene, which may increase the tendency to bind to the spike protein associated with human ACE2 neurons.
In other words, the mutation of these two amino acids is a threat to the human virus's adaptability.
It is worth mentioning that SARS-CoV-2 shares a similar cell neuron to SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein suggests that involvement of the human S ACE2 protein in the desired response can be modified.
In fact, a cryo-Em study shows that there is 10 - to 20-fold greater appetite for clicking than between ACE2 in humans and S protein in SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to know whether other cell surface sensors may be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with other S-subtypes.
There are other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may be caused by successful human CoV infection after biological transmission from infected animals.
In addition to the neurotransmitters, the outcome of intra-genetic transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by the absence of pathogens and inhibitory factors.
The differences in this viral protein between humans and natural HCoVs such as the spider, camel and rat may play a role in preventing the transmission of the same organism.
HCoVs have to switch between non-pathogen-dependent and anti-pathogen-dependent modes to successfully combine with the same organism.
Therefore, specific molecular specifications within this critical site of viral-epidemic interaction must be specified and characterized.
A broad, non-infectious genetic test for the pathogenic and inhibitory agents of SARS-CoV-2 using the CRISPR technology standard may bear fruit.
The emergence of a new HCoV: returning to its source.
The variation in the CoV in the virus gives sufficient chances for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the viral CoVs serve as the carrier genes for all HCoVs.
In addition, rapid growth mutation and recombination of host genes also lead to HCoV evaluation and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, finding or missing a specific protein carrier gene can greatly improve the identification of the viral carrier gene.
Among the additional proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be important for human infection, as is SARS-CoV from the virus strain that was isolated but found to produce different ORF8 proteins.
Elimination of the 29-nucleotide properties of SARS-CoV was found in groups quarantined at the beginning of the human infectious disease.
The absence of ORF8 cells in ORF8a and ORF8b is thought to be due to adaptation to growth factors that promote mutation in disease carriers.
However, SARS-CoV has a potential history of alpha- and beta-CoV gene fusion, whereas a large number of small regions of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-dependent genes have been observed.
The reassembly sites of the genetic material are also reported as nsp9, often nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Also, it was observed that the MERS-CoV pandemic was observed in cases of genetic modification of different strains, which occurred in camels with a crown in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs combine the genes of the non-structural carriers of CoVs from other animals.
It should also be noted that selection in humans may be involved in unintended mutations in the viral genes, usually those that cause selective viral resistance to pressure, such as the immune system in influenza.
An example of the effect is the normal loss of the ORF4 gene of the same HCoV-229E strain, which has a two-nucleotude loss.
Whereas the damage of ORF4 is seen in the virus and camel related HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a nucleotide entry point, which results in a growth spurt in the genome.
Last but not least, evaluation of new HCoVs has also been conducted on the genetic modification of the pathogenic virus reservoirs.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were observed when the videographers carried the CoV infection, showing a two-way interaction between the CoV and the evening star.
It seemed that the video had adapted well to the CoV in both its physiological and functional aspects.
For example, the inflammatory response disorders in the liver effectively reduce the viruses that are triggered by the CoV.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer of the pymic cells is suppressed due to increased stimulation of the natural killer blockade of the NKG2/CD94 cell neuron and the low level of molecular co-definition of Class I.
Furthermore, the high level of bio-oxygen stimulation (ROS) that results from the chemical metabolism of the pollen both suppresses CoV reproduction and the effect of exoribonuclease re-transcription, which gives the pressure selection to generate highly pathogenic virus strains when introducing a new pathogen.
Many types of viruses that cause CoVs may grow slowly by re-combination, resulting in the discovery of new proteins or proteins with anti-inflammatory properties.
So, it's no coincidence that the three new HCovs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or do not cause mild symptoms in pathogenic hosts such as mosquitoes and camels.
They multiply rapidly without inhibiting the immune system's strong immune response.
Here are some of the secrets to why people are seen to have the disease without showing any symptoms and what causes the severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are often due to an over-activation of the immune response and a cytokine disorder whereas a strong immune response is more likely to result in severe injury and heart damage.
Instead, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is interrupted by the replication of the CoV.
Similar strategies to cutting the link to the immune response may have had a beneficial effect on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in the evening.
Therefore, taking type I interferon at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection is beneficial.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pituitary gland is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with MCC950 are effective in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common theme from which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While the beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV, there is also a fecal CoV that has 96% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
While wild cats and other animals in the market are found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses, the closest middle-level disease to SARS-CoV has not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, suggesting that pangolins may be one of the intermediate carriers of the disease or that pangolin beta-CoVs may provide the genetic component of the final variant of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs returned to the light due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in mice and other animals has significantly changed our view of the importance of the origin of animal-to-human disease and the ecological significance of animal-to-human HCoV transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a viral origin and are transmitted to humans through a mediated viral infection.
If the SARS-CoV infection was caused by human-civet contact in a market, closing wet markets and killing civets would then effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent transmission of animal diseases to humans, given the detection of several pangolin beta-CoVs that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels with a crown for a long time.
Camels are an important means of transportation and the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
It is widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore possible to vaccinate all camels to control MERS, as was done with wildlife in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrence of MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause outbreaks.
Various animal-to-human CoVs are circulating in the air.
In particular, the CoVs with the potential to transmit animal disease to humans have a different cause.
There are many chances that CoVs and animal-borne diseases that are transmitted to humans will progress and recombine, causing new CoVs to emerge that could be more transmissible and/or potentially fatal to humans in the future.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
For the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crises, good preparedness and a response plan must be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been around on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserve until they have the opportunity to spread elsewhere.
Although worms have many traits that help spread viruses, the chances of humans coming into contact with worms and wildlife can be reduced if people are taught to survive.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is useful for better understanding the habitat of CoVs and their natural disease carriers, which have proven their effectiveness in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent human-to-human zoonotic viruses is for humans to avoid the natural habitat of human-to-human zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of evidence for the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic disease are still missing.
First, if the bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the pangolin, it will be interesting to see the circumstances that led the bats and the bats to share the same living environment.
Second, if video plays a more direct role in human transmission, how people interact with video needs to be understood.
Third, if the third mammal is a true central nervous system disease, how it interacts with different organisms including humans, bats and pangolins must be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals including washed animals can carry SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and test infection must be performed.
Whether it is a vulture, pangolin or other mammal, it is hoped that SARS-CoV-2 will be a virus derivative that is usually detected in its natural form of brain disease.
Further testing in this area will clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important results in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The format of updating COVID-19 tests for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" is important.
On February 6, 2020, our team published an emergency guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) cornoavirus infection. This guideline has added to our experience and provided a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical diagnostic evidence; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being updated regularly.
In this letter, we respond to one comment in the guideline and provide the latest testing formats for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" in reference to the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (weekly version) issued by the National Commission for Public Health of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization has classified COVID-19 as a global disease.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team issued an emergency warning policy and published it online in the Military Medical Research Journal on February 6, 2020.
It attracted a lot of attention from the day it was published.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on research findings and clinical trial experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being continually updated.
The COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment measures issued by the National People's Health Commission of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, issued a total of seven revisions that have effectively changed their content.
Now our rules have been poisoned by Zhou et al., and they've come up with a simple recommendation based on medical expertise.
Their work has added clarity to the laws and has also provided a valuable reference for the disease's global reach.
We acknowledge their important work and show our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updating in light of the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Weekly Testing Type) and current studies.
With reference to the weekly edition (3 March 2020), to confirm suspected cases it is necessary to combine one item of historical symptoms from the study of infectious diseases and two items of medical symptoms to make a comprehensive analysis, or the need to obtain three items of medical symptoms if there is no clear history of infectious diseases.
History of infectious disease studies: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS_CoV-2 infection cases (found in a nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days or less before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of confirmed cases (>=2 cases with fever/infection and respiratory symptoms within two weeks in areas such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Medical symptoms: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) having symptoms of a COVID-19 infection; (3) a normal, decreased total white blood cell count, or a decreased white blood cell count in the early stages of the onset.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with a single bacterial agent or blood sample as follows: (1) real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole virus sequence genome showing high similarity to known abnormal coronaviruses; (3) serum detection of IgM specific antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2; replacement of missing SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody, or >4 times the size or frequency of the recovery phase above that of the critical phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing of respiratory nucleic acid or blood samples has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
The detection of germs in blood samples was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020), and then the detection of blood fluid was added in the seventh edition.
The change is based on researchers' ongoing work to find a better and faster nucleic acid detector for testing, as well as samples from the respiratory tract of patients with blood tests, which has increased the availability of more tests, supporting the delivery of specific antibodies from the resulting detected antibodies as a validated procedure.
In addition, there are many signs that remind us to be alert to the abnormal and symptomatic symptoms of patients.
Therefore, the map of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies a person without symptoms as "low risk".
The points system also requires that additional medical procedures and studies are performed.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will be useful and that readers will be invited to leave their comments.
In the case of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" investigations, we suggest that you follow and comply with the latest guidelines in your home country.
Our team will update our directions in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths caused by COVID-19, the highest daily death toll.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths caused by COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day caused by the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Studies, Research and Control (IEDCR) reported the number of reported cases including 114 standing cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were reported.
In a brief online report, IEDCR Director, DR Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths were among four men and one woman.
According to DR Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50 years old.
It also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local newspaper, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transportation will be suspended for longer than previously planned, until next Saturday.
The suspension of public transportation had already started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Travel of basic goods -- healthcare, fuel and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, with two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million cases worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The incident came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus case and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
South Korea has claimed, as of Thursday, to be one of the few countries that has survived coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus have been recorded, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBC News reports, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Across the world, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the disease from spreading further.
On Thursday, Serei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the curfew in the capital until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to receive unpaid leave until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, ten against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfews were in effect only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order through May 1.
Stores in Australia lower the limit for toilet paper per purchase.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian department store chain Woolworths and Coles lowered the purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and one pack per purchase at all national stores, respectively.
ALDI imposed a one-package limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted as a message on the check-out points and on the Facebook page.
Shoppers reportedly continued to buy fearing COVID-19 in case people needed to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper to one package per order.
The changes followed the previous four-pack per purchase restriction issued by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in a statement in March, reported that the four-pack space restrictions "many stores are selling at the drop-off time", calling the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a post on Facebook, called it unexpected.
Purchases have increased "surprisingly" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Cost Store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
In addition to reducing the shortage, Coles ordered from major suppliers to speed up deliveries, Woolworths ordered more products, while ALDI made the planned products for Wednesday earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers should increase their products, but local council restrictions on loading times have weighed on them.
He expects the production costs to rise and the distribution of raw materials to try to meet demand, among other specificities.
On Tuesday, Aldi announced that in the coming early delivery period, some stores will not continue to operate on Wednesdays, especially,
According to News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that the warehouses will be filled with products every night.
He said toilet paper is a heavy commodity, which leads to a low quantity of goods, and, when sold, leaves shelves empty, exacerbating the feeling of scarcity.
Colos and Woolworths have a vision that if they fill the shelves with goods, if products like toilet paper and disinfectants are filled, then fear would be reduced, Russell Zimmerman said according to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper that produces our very poor quality toilet paper said last Wednesday that it will run out.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to a report from News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first person to bid at the Melbourne auction, when fewer auctions were held because buyers were away on the long International Labour Day weekend.
Thursday edition NT News, published the same day in Darwin, contained eight pages of text meant to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The store was basically reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3 when they said they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are in high demand, including mouthwashes, disinfectants, dry goods, hand washing soap and flour.
Similarly, in Australia, the British online supermarket chain Ocado on Sunday evening limited the sale of Andress toilet paper to two 12-packets.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a global pandemic.
Although the term "global pandemic" refers to a disease that spreads globally but is not as serious as some cases, the World Health Organization has noted the need for governments to take action.
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.Wikinews_6:1159 https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_declares_COVID-19_pandemic CC_BY-SA_2.5 en If countries detect, diagnose, treat, follow up and organize their populations for response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization.
I am deeply concerned about both the shocking levels of violence and the terrible and shocking levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global epidemic is "unprecedented".
He said in comments published by CNN in mid-February, "Besides influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from a lightning strike to a sustained global outbreak.
Ghebreyesus also expressed a similar view, saying "We have never before seen a global pandemic spread by coronavirus".
He continued, "We have never before seen a global disease that could be controlled at the same time".
The new situation as the global pandemic continues is a result of the World Health Organization's January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the outbreak, "in the basement, will be worse".
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The global coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 is an ongoing global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory symptoms of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a Health Emergency of Global Concern on 30 January 2020, and declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.6 million cases of COVID-9 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, among which approximately 97,000 deaths have been reported.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while the global average is 13.04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath.
In severe cases, there are also bruising and symptoms of severe respiratory problems.
The time from susceptibility to onset of symptoms is about five days, but it can range from two days to fourteen days.
There is no recognized vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is the treatment of the symptoms of the disease.Preventive measures suggested include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, and personal monitoring and quarantine of people suspected of infection.
Leaders around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, bandages, workplace risk controls and closures.
The global pandemic has caused severe socioeconomic distress worldwide, postponing or cancelling of sport, religious, political and cultural events and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by shopping scares.
Schools and universities have been closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting an estimated 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there are cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other populations of or from East and Southeast Asia, and others from areas with cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and major factory closures, there is a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Shina (Hubei Province) reported cases of unknown gang rape on December 31, 2029, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases are related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus has the origin of human-transmitted diseases in livestock.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is related to the evening star coronavirus, the coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and the person has no apparent link to the latter group of marketers.
Of the group of cases first reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have been in contact with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post suggested that the case was followed up on 17 November 2019, with a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, being the first case.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that new cases reported in China had declined but increased in Italy, Iran, South Korea, and the number of new cases reported in China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be cases that are not reported, especially those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, the proportion of cases reported among young people, aged 19 and under, was 2.4% of cases worldwide.The Chairman of the UK Scientific Advisory, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would be infected before a resilient and effective immune system was achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people tested positive for COVID-19, whose test results were positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, countries that tested more than 3% of their total population had official rules against testing people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, with unreported infections being the source of 76% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March suggested that the estimated number of infections in Italy could be much higher than the reported cases.
The previous estimate of the baseline reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not have the disease, the period from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, an estimated 97,000 deaths have been caused by COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, nearly 80% of the deaths were people over 60, and 75% of them had pre-existing medical conditions including heart disease and diabetes.The official total death toll from the global COVID-19 pandemic is generally referred to as people who have been diagnosed with COVID and die according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be much higher, excluding those who die without being diagnosed - for example, those who die at home, those in home care, etc.
Partial data from Italy shows that the increased death toll during the global pandemic has exceeded the official total COVID-19 death toll by 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know that [the reported death toll] is relatively low", a statement confirmed by unofficial reports of a decreased number in the United States. Similar decreases in the number of deaths often occur during pandemics, such as the 2009 N1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 1.
By the end of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were being reported in each of Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By the end of March 13, more than four countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures were commonly used to reduce deaths.
This figure varies from region to region and is facilitated by the number of diagnoses, the quality of healthcare, treatment options, the time to outbreak and social characteristics such as age, gender and general health.The death rate per case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a given period.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall case-by-case mortality rate is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 1, 2020.
The number varies according to the country.
China, estimated the death rate as a proportion of cases to have decreased from 17.3% (those with symptoms starting on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (those without symptoms starting after 1 February 2020).Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people tested dead from the disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (both tested and untested) who die from the disease.
This status is not time-bound and follows a specific community from the time of infection through the decisions of the case.
A number of academics have tried to calculate this figure for a specific population.
The Exford University Center for Disease-Based Health Sciences estimates the global infection death rate worldwide to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimate of this number is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and statistical analysis of the diagnostic effect of the CFR estimate.
The World Health Organization says the global disease is under control.
The maximum duration of the outbreak is uncertain and varies by location.
Macieji Boni of Penn State University says the outbreaks of infectious diseases, mostly in the highlands, have left her uncertain.
But it's impossible to make any reasonable predictions about when it will be".
China's top health adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "it will be over by the end of June" if all governments are organized to follow the World Health Organization's measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Health Sciences said that SARSCoV-2 "will be circular, with a one- or two-year cycle".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Fergusson, physical distancing and other measures are needed "until vaccination is received (possibly 18 months and more)".
"I think it is unlikely to be a coronavirus - the virus can be transmitted quickly - it disappears completely" and "it is possible to turn into a seasonal disease, which can return every year", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University.
The risk of relapse depends on the strong immune system and the growth limit.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are generally non-specific and people with the disease may not show symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and coughing (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion of hoarseness (hoarseness), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, hoarseness, headache, chills, diarrhea, coughing up blood, diarrhea or blue discoloration.The World Health Organization states that approximately one person with six symptoms may be severely ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists acute symptoms as respiratory distress, chronic pain, no pressure, sudden nausea, difficulty swallowing, and facial or facial blushing; immediate medical attention is recommended for anyone who experiences symptoms. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe bruising, severe respiratory distress symptoms, serious condition, low blood pressure and death.
Those who have been infected may be asymptomatic, who do not have any medical symptoms but the test results confirm infection, so researchers have recommended that anyone who has been in close contact with someone with confirmed infection be closely monitored and screened to rule out infection.
China estimates the proportion of people without symptoms at just 44%.
The period of time between infection and onset of symptoms is between one and 14 days; usually five days. In uncertain samples, the fraction of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and then fell to 15%.
Some information about how the disease spreads is still unknown.
The disease is thought to be most commonly transmitted by close contact and cough drops that appear when someone coughs, sneezes, or talks; that is, when someone is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) of you.
A study found that an uncovered cough can cause cough drops to fly from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for a long time, which can be released when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also cause respiratory distress, including when speaking, although the virus is not completely transmitted through the air.
The spots can be on the mouth and nose of people close to you or you can breathe through the lungs.
Medical procedures such as CPR can cause respiratory secretion to be sprayed which can cause it to spread in the air.
It can also be spread when a person touches a sensitive area, such as the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
Despite concerns that it can be spread through feces, the risk is thought to be reduced.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days of onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms and later stages of the disease appear.
People were diagnosed with the disease three days before the symptoms appeared, suggesting that transmission is possible before more symptoms appear.
There are only a few reported laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases, but symptomatic transmission has been detected in some countries during screening of infected people.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that as it is not generally clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others, and the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on bags (polypropylene) for up to three days and 304 stainless steel, on one day on wood, and up to four days on copper surfaces.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that livestock can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise people to wash their hands after touching livestock, such as when touching other areas that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rare virus, first identified in three people with acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan.
All of the symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are caused by a naturally occurring coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which adheres to its hard shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It was thought to have an animal-borne disease origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of the Sarbecovirus (Cluster B) along with two strains of the fungus.
96% is the same as the total genome level of other samples of the coronavirus virus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid variation in specific parts of the genome sequence between the parasite viruses and human ones.
A comparison of the entire genome to date has identified a maximum of 92% of the genetic material shared by the coronavirus strain and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the strain is a moderate-to-severe disease.
The virus infection can be professionally diagnosed based on the symptoms, although the final confirmation is the replication of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infected spores or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR and Ct in Wuhan suggested that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although it is particularly small, with most of the imaging symptoms masking other lesions and pathologies.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT not be used as a primary screening test for COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing methods for SARS-CoV-2 first announced on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) replication.
The test can be performed with a breathing tube or blood sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually done with nasal fluid, although nasal fluid can also be used.
As of 6 April 2020, none have been confirmed as valid for approval for widespread use.
In the United States, the blood-fluid test developed by Cellex is approved for emergency use only in licensed laboratories.
Symptomatic CT scans of people with symptoms include unseen bottles on the floor and lack of fluid between the lungs and the chest.
The Italian Federation of Fisiologists is collecting a worldwide online database of the scan results of confirmed cases.
Due to the prevalence of other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation with limited standardisation for identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT and PCR and showed that although imaging is not specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a tool for testing in infectious sites.
Artificial intelligence-based neural network testing was developed to detect viral imaging symptoms on both X-rays and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing and putting the syringe in the trash.
Those who have already been infected are advised to wear masks in public.
Distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or warned against all non-essential travel to and from the countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the level of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, with parts of the community not knowing where or how it has been infected.Healthcare providers caring for someone who may be infected are advised to use advanced precautions, touch precautions, and eye protection.Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine where the infection originated and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing articles calling for restrictions on such protection.
Several mobile apps have been activated or suggested for optional use, as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy protection solutions, such as using Bluetooth to see a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. Myths circulate about how to prevent infection; for example, washing the nose and rinsing the tongue with a towel is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating; and after someone has coughed, sneezed, or coughed.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which releases its protective membrane.
The CDC further recommended the use of hand sanitizer made from alcohol containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be sterilized with a number of solutions (one minute sterilization of stainless steel surfaces), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isoproponal, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed in a healthcare facility such as an office or day care center, all facilities such as offices, restrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, flash drives, and ATM machines used by patients, should be disinfected.
Health authorities recommended that people cover their mouth and nose by coughing or sneezing at the corners of their throats or in a toilet, and that they add garbage to any toilet immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who are sick, as wearing a mask can limit the amount of air and distance droplets need to fall when they speak, sneez or cough.
The WHO has issued recommendations on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the risk of people touching their face, which is a major source of death without proper hand hygiene".Masks are also recommended for use by people caring for an infected person.
WHO advises wearing masks for healthy people who are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-healthy facial masks made of cloth.China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for public health personnel, especially when they are within 1 meter (3 feet) or less of other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when riding public transport or in public places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear face masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for anyone entering a warehouse to wear a face mask.
Israel asks all residents to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and buses in surrounding cities to wear face masks from April 1.
Panama made wearing face masks compulsory when going outdoors, and also recommended the production of home-made face masks for use by people who cannot afford face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as visible distancing) is one of the infection control measures aimed at reducing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between people.
These measures include curfews, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, concerts, or shopping centers.
People can practice social distancing by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding public places, using non-touchable greetings, and avoiding others visually.
Many governments are now legalizing or recommending social distancing in the regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of gatherings recommended by US government officials and health authorities was easily reduced from 2500 people (unless there is a known COVID-19 outbreak in the state) to 50 people, and a maximum of 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned social gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with low health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and low immune system face a higher risk of chronic illness and disability and the CDC advised them to stay at home as much as possible in the social areas affected by the outbreak. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "visible distancing", to make it clear that the goal should be to reduce visible contact by maintaining social contacts, whether indirect or indirect.
The use of the term "social distancing" has resulted in people going into complete social isolation, rather than being advised to contact others in similar ways.Some authorities have given sexual health advice to be used during the pandemic.
These include the recommendation to have sex only with your partner who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Home quarantine is recommended for people who have been tested positive for COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
Health authorities have issued clear guidelines for proper quarantine.Many governments have legalized or recommended quarantine for all communities in affected areas.
The strongest quarantine recommendations are given to high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last time they were likely in contact.
The strategies for controlling the spread are to stop or reduce it, and to reduce it.
The stop is taken at the early stages of the outbreak and they want to search for and quarantine the infected and similarly take other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the community.
When it is not possible to stop the spread of the disease, the efforts are then moved to the mitigation phase, and measures are taken to slow down the spread and reduce the impact on the health system and society.
Both the termination and the reduction of the measure can be taken at the same time.
Reducing the spread of the disease requires more drastic measures to bring the global epidemic back to normal by reducing the baseline incidence to less than 1. The infectious disease outbreak management unit is trying to reduce the rise in the epidemic, known as the expansion of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of missing health services and gives more time to prepare vaccines and medicines.
The most effective interventions to manage outbreaks include personal protection measures, such as hygiene, wearing a face mask, and quarantine; sexual measures to avoid overt distancing such as closing schools and banning large gatherings; community involvement to remind people to accept and protest such interference; and similar environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also implemented several measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has imposed widespread screening and local quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of people affected.
Singapore has provided financial support to people who have been subjected to self-isolation and imposed large fines on those who do not.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and banned the price hike of medical supplies.British and US designs show that mitigation (reducing but not stopping the spread of the virus) and suppression (reversing the growth of the virus) have many challenges.
The best reduction techniques can reduce the need for healthcare by up to 2/3 of these deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the destruction of health systems.
The pressure can be controlled but must be maintained while the virus circulates in the human community (or until a vaccine is available, if that is the case), otherwise transmission will rapidly double when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention in the global epidemic has social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral treatment approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including ongoing drug trials.
Taking available cold medicines, drinking juice, and resting can help to alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, radiotherapy, and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use can worsen the results.
Several combinations that have already been approved to treat other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
WHO has described increasing the scope and adaptation of healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a basic response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources on several levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, suspending selection procedures whenever possible, classifying and quarantining COVID-19 patients, and emergency care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of respirators and available beds.
There are several claims about where the first case (so-called Ebola patient) originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus may be in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Huaihai has been steadily increasing.
These were mainly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animal species; or, in other words, it has an animal disease origin that is transmitted to humans.The group of ticks with the known cause was detected on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who notified Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a team of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about "coronavirus from SARS".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, warned police about the spread of fake news, among other things, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her managers for instigating fear.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Board finally issued a public notice on March 31 and notified the World Health Organization.
A sufficient number of unknown cases were reported to Wuhan health authorities who initiated an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled by an average of seven per day.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, which was timed to coincide with the Chinese New Year's traffic with Wuhan being a transportation hub and the largest railway interchange.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms by the end of January 20, 2020, and on March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of April 9, 202o, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and 364 have recovered.
At least one case has been detected in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the global pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and imposed border controls.
The nationalisation response includes restrictive measures such as quarantine (also known as stay-at-home orders, house orders, or general lockdowns) and curfews.Starting April 2, nearly 300 million people, or nearly 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown in the United States.More than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people are in lockdown in South Africa, and 130 billion people are in lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later - almost one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggested the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian saw a group of cases of unknown cause on December 26, where her hospital notified Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Genetic testing of early patient samples on 27 December 2019 revealed SARS from coronavirus samples.
A medical notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The World Health Organization was notified on the same day.
When the messages were leaked, Wuhan doctors warned the police to "spread false news" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China has previously said that there is no "clear evidence" that the virus is transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a transformative campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as "fighting the people" to stop the spread of the virus.

The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed in several cases on a shortage of supplies, caused by increased consumption of materials to combat the outbreak, fear buying, and a crisis in factory and supply operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical supplies due to increasing consumer demand and shortages of suppliers.
Several places also witnessed emotional panic buying which led to the closure of retail stores such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, leading to shortages of supplies.

Retail visits to Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Trade in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
This was also due to a 33-43% decrease in the number of shopping malls in March compared to February.
People operating in shopping malls around the world were imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermometers to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the global pandemic has caused an economic slowdown that has put between 14 and 22 million people in poverty in Latin America at a much lower level than the conditions under which the global pandemic would have been absent.
In mid-January and February, during the epidemic in Wuhan, nearly 5 million miners in China lost their jobs.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been much hatred, discrimination and racial discrimination against Jains and people of East Asian origin, and people from Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and violence have been reported in many countries, including Europe, Western Asia, North America, and the Asia Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most cases were confirmed) were of the kind of things that were being reported and then groups of people around the world were attacking the Jayens who were doing what they said they deserved.
In some African countries there is a lot of Jainism.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei said they were discriminated against where they came from.
There is support for Jaynes, online and offline, and in the areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak reached new countries, people in Italy, the first European country to see a severe COVID-19 outbreak, were also suspected of being viewed with suspicion and distant eye. Citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea signed a campaign to ban Jains from entering their country to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is active on Twitter.
The Jayens as well as other Asians in Britain and the United States also reported an increase in incidents of racial discrimination, as well as stigma.

The symptoms of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its relationship to the SARS-CoV-2 virus including the way in which a person is diagnosed and the presence of antibodies that then respond to the infection.
Detection of the virus in a sample confirmed by RT-PCR, which then tracks the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test is specifically designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a recent or current infection.
The detection of antibodies (serogly) can be used for laboratory tests and population monitoring.
The antibody test shows the number of people who have the disease, including people with mild and unreported symptoms or those who have symptoms.
The exact severity of the disease and the degree of immune response in the population can be determined by this test.
As the testing is limited, as of March 2020 no country had reliable information on how to prevent the virus in their population.
On March 23, no country had tested 3% of its population, and there is a huge gap between the number of tests countries have done.
This difference is likely to be reflected in the increasing number of cases and the mortality rate, which is likely to be much higher in some countries.
Using the transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the laboratory to make respiratory samples from various sources, including a sample of plaque or a sample of fluid.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test is performed on food samples that can only be taken during the first week of the illness.
When the virus needs it, it releases it through the throat and spreads to the lungs.
For the second week of the test, other samples taken from the respiratory tract and then sucked into the catheter or what they coughed (fluid) can be used.
One of the first PCR labs developed by Charite in Berlin in January 2020 using the transcriptional polymerase chain reaction and then reverse transcription (rRT-PCP), was airbrushed from 250,000 lips and then distributed to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The British also conducted a test on 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech conducted a clinical, oral test for SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
The "E" vector that is shared by coronaviruses, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp vector were examined.Jayna, BGI Group is among the first companies to receive National Heart Health Administration emergency response approval for PCR-based oral SARS-CoV-2 testing.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has distributed the RT-PCR test samples for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as its Global Response Resource.
One of the skin-to-skin lab tests of the earlier versions of the lab lab results were incomplete and therefore incorrect, and the CDC's international lab conducted in Atlanta produced an average of less than 100 samples per day to be tested positively throughout February 2020.
The test using two samples was found to be unreliable until February 28, 2020, when state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The lab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an Emergency Medical Device.
From 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests will be conducted nationwide.
A nationwide COVID-19 test drive was launched on March 9, 2020.
No quantity is specified; the sample has been taken and must be processed according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnologu VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the laboratory was registered with the Federal Health Care Supervision Service. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic said it had developed a laboratory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostic was approved by the FDA to perform a laboratory test in 3.5 hours, so one machine can perform an average of 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct tests of Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Halogic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA to then produce a 45-minute test.
The FDA has approved the use of isothermal nucleic acids in laboratories, thus enlarging the technology to replace PCR.
Since this does not require a much larger temperature cycle, this method can tell the user the result in a matter of minutes and in 13 seconds.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott is expected to produce up to 50,000 samples per day.These tests will use only an antibody that is specific to the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) and will be manufactured in Taiwan, with the expectation of getting results in 15 to 20 minutes as fast as a flu test.
In March 2020, the previously available data was reviewed for "previously inexpensive chest X-rays from laboratories, where CT [computer imaging] results may show more symptoms".
A common form of CT is a series of lateral lobe-joint lenses with the connectivity, structure and shape they need.
Reproductive dysfunction, manic patterns and bumps when the pain is severe.
A study comparing PCR and CT performed in Wuhan, the current outbreak's source, showed that CT is more accurate than PCR, although it is less specific, with many of the imaging patterns overlapping such as pneumonia and pain management.
As of March 2020, the American College of Surgeons recommended that "CT not be used as a laboratory or primary laboratory for COVID-19". In March 2020, the CDC recommended that the primary laboratory be PCR.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies containing IgM and IgG.
It can be used to diagnose an individual infection from 7 days or when the disease develops, to monitor the immunity and then monitor the population.
The high-dose system of several medical laboratories can then be combined but its availability depends on the output of each system.
CLT is usually used for a single sample of the blood sample, although a solid sample can be used to monitor the immune response.
PoCT is obtained by drilling a blood drop through the skin.
Unlike the PCR method, the dose-taking step does not require a combination of measures.On March 26, 2020, the FDA nominated 29 companies that will then notify the agency as needed so that they can distribute the antibody samples.
As of April 7, 2020, only one lab has been approved by the FDA for emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmune Health Lab and Epitope Lab approved in Europe their lab lab lab, which can track IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in a blood sample.
The lab's capacity is several hundred samples per hour, which is much faster than the standard PCR method of viral RNA tracing.
Antibiotics are usually monitored 14 days after the first infection.In early April, the UK introduced a non-antibiotic oral vaccine that was sold and used well.
Hong Kong has implemented a program whereby suspects can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample of the patient's sputum", spit on it, and send it to the lab and the results will be reported shortly after.The UK NHS has announced a pilot test of a laboratory test on suspected patients at home that will eliminate the risk of infecting another patient if they leave the hospital or have the virus killed in an unused ambulance.Every week in a vehicle with COVID-19 suspects, healthcare professionals take samples and then use them as a precaution.
Centers with transportation help South Koreans get through rapid testing, which is much higher than in any other country.In Germany, the National Association for Health Insurance Status and Physicians said on March 2, they are unable to perform up to 12,000 tests a day in ambulances compared to 10,700 tests a week ago.
The medical insurance pays for the cost of the test if the doctor has ordered it.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Foundation, Germany has a total capacity to produce 160,000 samples per week.
From 19 March, the test with a car will be offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany is unknown, as only those available are reported.
In the first laboratory data collection, which took place in the week of 12/2020, a total of 483,295 samples were tested, including the week of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of testing samples from 64 patients in parallel, then combining samples only for further testing if the results were available.Wuhan's 2,000-meter-long emergency laboratory known as "Huo-Yan" (in Japanese: XXXX, or "The Eye of Fire") opened on 5 February 2020 at BGI, which can process 10,000 samples per day.
The building, which was inspected by BGI founder Wang Jian and modeled over five days, was found to have more than 47% of the equivalent cost of lifting the quarantine doubled if the samples were not compliant.
The Wuhan virus was immediately followed by Huo-Yan's in Shenzhen, Tainjin in Beijing, and Shanghai, and a further 12 in Jayna.
On 4 March 2020, the combined daily capacity was 50,000 samples per day.Open source, lean designs developed with Origami Assays were released that can now test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 samples.These balance designs can be operated with small laboratories without the need for robotic hands.
In March, the scarcity and insufficient quantity of the chemical compound became a national concern for many laboratories in the EU and the UK and the US.
This led some authors to oversee the sample preparation process and then heat the sample to 98 C (208 C) for 5 hours to remove the RNA genomes from the extra lab. On 31 March, Imata announced that it would conduct more tests on the human coronavirus population than any other country, and thus scale up the lab level to reach a larger population.
This was a combination of the vehicle's power with its sensors, the purchase of small labs from Group 42 and BGI (which is in their "Huo-Yan" emergency monitoring lab in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing 10,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first of this scale to operate outside of Jena.
The combination of different laboratory tests to target different parts of the coronavirus skin was done in Jena, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has taken the German formula to be sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to use it.
The content in Germany was released on 17 January 2020; the system developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not come out until 28 January, which delayed the availability of the tests in the US. Both China and the US had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia did not have enough kits to meet the demand and the tests recommended by health experts.
However, experts say that the widespread availability of the test in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The power of the labs, which are mostly private labs, has been built up over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the integration of laboratory programs as the best way to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for laboratories caused by the high spread of the disease is causing hundreds of thousands of laboratories to be stuck in private labs in the United States, and the supply of sampling and chemicals is running low.
In March 2020, Jayna mentioned a problem with trust in her clients' lips.
In the United States, a test tube developed by the CDC was "wrong"; the government later removed restrictions on private testing. Spain purchased a test tube from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioesy Biotechnology Co Ltd. which was found to have faulty results.
The company explained that the false result was due to a failed sample or incorrect use of oral.
The Ispaqiya government has announced that it will withdraw the labels that claimed false results and replace the different labels made at Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the labels Chegu Republic bought from Jayna produced false results. Ispaqiya bought 1.2 million labels from Jallo which produced false results.
Prime Minister Matovic said these were being dumped into the Danube.Kara The Turkish Health Minister said the pepper spray they bought from Jayna was "very wrong" and therefore "not used".The British bought 3.5 million pepper sprays from Jayna but in early April 2020 announced it was unusable.
The tests, followed by quarantine of people who had been diagnosed and those who had been seen with traces of SARS-CoV-2 were close, leading to the detection of the virus.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first COVID-19 death was detected in Italy, conducted a second round of community-wide laboratory tests on about 3,400 people, which then lasted for ten days.
Up to half of the people had no symptoms, and all of the people who had had symptoms were put into quarantine.
By removing the placenta, this eliminates the pain completely.
Despite strong recommendations to lift travel restrictions, laboratory and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been seen to spread much less than in other developed countries, but without significantly tightening the closure of restaurants and shops.
Many celebrations were canceled, and Singapore first told people to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened after the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries are controlling the outbreak with strict measures such as quarantine, testing and restrictions on travel to the point of origin, but the stay-at-home order is not as strict as in Iceland and South Korea.
The study found that these countries had too many tests, so the adult mortality rate was lower than the overall mortality rate, which may be because they could better detect when there were few or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have national laboratory capacity and therefore limited experience with COVID-19 send the first of the top ten COVID-19 missing patients samples to one of the WHO's 16 laboratories for laboratory confirmation.
Of the 16 satellites, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the section "Percentage of results in the sample" is then defined by the country's laboratory code.
In a country that only tests hospitalizations, a large percentage of the country's population is screened, whether they have symptoms or not, except that they are the same thing.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, grease, insects, and other contaminants.
Handwashing (or hand-washing), also known as hand sanitization, is the practice of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, grease, pests or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands regularly with soap in these "difficult times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which can then be spread by spitting.
People can also catch respiratory diseases such as a cold or a cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth (e.g. with urine).
Washing your hands with soap is important five times a day: before and after cleaning, after washing the baby's ass or changing the diapers, before feeding, before eating and before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
If you do not have soap and water, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after you have been treated for a sick person.
After changing the diaper or washing the baby's towel.
After you have run your nose, coughed or sneezed.
After touching animals, feeding them or after handling animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to healthcare systems.
Washing hands before giving medicines or medical care prevents or reduces the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of infections (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for those working in the food and healthcare sector, but it is also important for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus, and other diseases; it eliminates diarrheal infections; respiratory infections;
and reduces the mortality rate of children born at home.
A 2013 study shows that improving the handwashing process can lead to improvements in the developmental period of a child under five years of age.
In developing countries, the child mortality rate associated with respiratory problems and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by simply changing habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by 50%.
A campaign to raise awareness about hand washing can reduce diarrhea by up to a third, which is equivalent to providing clean water to low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrhea is associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap may be the most important and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and rare respiratory infections (ARI), which is something that can be done directly at home, in schools, and throughout the community.
Pneumonia, a very serious ARI, is the number one cause of death in children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia combined cause about 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after urination can save more lives than any vaccine or treatment, and it can reduce diarrhea by half and deaths from respiratory diseases by half every three months.
Handwashing is usually done in conjunction with other hygiene awareness-raising programs, such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Hand washing also protects people from skin infections that are transmitted by contact.
A minor side effect of washing hands frequently is that washing hands frequently can cause dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itching, skin pain such as eczema or itching and acne, which is common among healthcare workers.
Washing your hands frequently is known as an OCD symptom.
Washing hands with soap is important at five times a day to reduce the risk of mouth infection: after using the toilet (coughing, urinating), after washing the baby's ass (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling meat, fish or chicken.
Other times when proper hand washing should be used are for the prevention of disease spread, including before and after treating a wound or wound; after coughing, coughing, or flushing; after handling animal feces or handling animals; and after handling garbage.
In many countries, very few people wash their hands with soap.
A study in 2015 found that in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of households practice handwashing with soap.A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate at 97; the United States near the middle with 77; and China with the lowest rate at 23%.Several behavioral change measures are now in place to increase the adoption of handwashing practices at critical times.The option of group handwashing of children at set times of the day at school is a tool for developing countries to help prevent children from handwashing.
The "Emergency Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of how to improve children's health and education.
With the payment of twice a year, in addition to the enjoyment of soap, brushing and flossing, is the origin of a national program.
It is also well implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of the parasites is facilitated by soap or a water-based disinfectant.
The main step for soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase their efficiency.
Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin, as fats and proteins, which are part of the natural soil, are not soluble in water.
Cleaning is, however, aided by a reasonable water flow.
Hard soap, as it can be reused, may contain bacteria left over from the previous use.
A few studies on the transmission of bacteria in contaminated soap have shown that it is difficult for bacteria to travel through water.
The CDC recommends "liquid hand soap is best kept out of reach and out of the trash".
The soap with antibacterial properties is widely advertised and therefore the public health community is better informed.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of pesticides or recommended disinfectants for insects with no antibodies that are considered natural.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which in turn contain antibacterial agents that kill insects.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant drugs are not selected as bacteria-killing soaps, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surface treatments and skin care, modern forms may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, active benzoic acid and additional skin coolers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts).Comparative evaluations by the University of Oregon Department of Public Health show that pure soap works as well as consumer soap in the case of disinfectant soaps containing triclosan to prevent and remove bacteria from the hands.
Hot water that you can carry in your hand is not hot water that kills bacteria.
The number of bacteria increases when the body temperature is 37°C.
However, soapy hot water is more effective than soapy cold water in terms of cleaning with natural oil, which then catches dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, a study by scientists shows that using warm water has no effect on reducing the number of parasites on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a hand sanitizer that does not use water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most are isopropyl alcohols or ethanol-based compounds that are then diluted with carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to form a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to be dissolved, or foam to be easily reused and reduce the effects of alcohol on the skin.
In addition to the hydrogen peroxide filter, the disinfectant also increases the effectiveness. Hand sanitizers with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are sufficient disinfectants.
Hand sanitizer kills bacteria, antibodies (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RVS, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and measles) and viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (3.5 times reduction, also 35 times reduction in number) of bacteria on the hands after 30 seconds of application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 times reduction) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of application. Hand sanitizer is more effective than bacteria and does not cause viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are usually immune to norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, which are the most common cause of gestroenteritis. Hand sanitizers or good alcohol should be used to rub wet hands or to properly rub both hands together.
The front and back of the hands and the inter- and end of all fingers are rubbed for an average of 30 seconds until the liquid, bubble or gel is dry.
Wash your fingertips and rub your palms together.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands with hand sanitizer, especially if your hands are very dirty.
The high use of these products depends on their ease of use and their effective insecticide; however, they should not be a substitute for a conventional hand sanitizer with no soap or water.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin with wet skin and/or emollients in the formula.
The desiccating effect of alcohol can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the drink or by replacing them.
In medical tests, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with emollients cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or pesticide soap.
Allergies to touch, urticaria, alcohol-related erections or hand rubbing are not common.
The risk of developing dematitis is then lower than with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, they do not wash hands with anything other than water, they only disinfect.
That's why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of germs, because germs will be on the hands.
Hand sanitizers without bottles are highly dependent on their composition and formula, and are always more effective when used with alcohol-filled bottles.
Recently, those that have been used as benzalkonium chloride have been found to have a more stable and organized insecticidal activity after oral administration, unlike alcohol, which is then seen to be less active when used regularly, as it is more likely to irritate the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use it instead for dancing or partying.
The sand and gravel run off by themselves, but they are less effective than soap.
One concern is that the mosquitoes may be accompanied by insects, which in turn increases the spread of the disease where it should be reduced.
Like soap, the soap is also a cleanser, as it reacts with water to form an alkaline mixture.
WHO recommends that you use a toothpick or a toothpick instead of soap when soap is not available.
The proper handwashing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the transmission of disease include the following:
You can soak your hands in warm or running water.
Running water is recommended as standing water can be contaminated and the water temperature does not make a difference.
Wash the skin of the hands thoroughly with soap, including the back of the hands, the tips of the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap cleanses the skin of germs, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using only water.
You rub it for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates a scratch, which then helps to pass the germs through the skin, and further rubbing releases more germs from the skin.
The flowing water.
In addition to standing up, you can also raise your hands back.
Towel drying or air drying
Wet or slightly damp hands can get dirty easily. The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, wrist, interfinger area and under the nails.
Artificial nails and paint nails can hide under insects.
Soaking in lotion is often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage and thus increase the risk of infection.
There are various cheap ways to make it easier to wash hands when tap water and/or soap is not available, such as pouring water from a drain or well-drained area and/or using a tap if you are in a developing country. In situations of water shortage (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are ways to store water, such as "small green hanger" and other low-cost options.
A small hanging plastic is a simple technology that uses plastic suspended from a string, which is then tilted so that a small amount of water can be removed to wash hands and soap.
Drying hands properly is an important part of the sanitation process, but the effectiveness of hand drying in public areas is controversial.
Many studies show that towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers in most toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry, to compare the hygiene standards provided by paper towels, hot air dryers and modern air-conditioned air dryers.
After hand washing and drying in warm air, the number of bacteria found increased by 194% in fingers and 254% in malaria.
Air-drying in airplanes has increased the total number of bacteria by 42% and fleas by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a towel, bacteria on the fingers decrease by 76% and on the palm by 77%. Scientists have also developed laboratory tests to detect the presence and potential transmission of hand washing and other washing environment that can then occur through drying.
The air dryer in the plane, which then emits air at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to spray the hand-dried insects and contaminate the area and people using the area and the washroom area which are up to 2 meters apart.
The use of the heated air in the dryer spreads the insects within 0.25 meters of the dryer.
No significant spread of pests was observed in the towels.In 2005, a study by TUV Produkt and Umwelt, evaluated different hand dryer methods.
The following change in the number of bacteria after hand drying was observed:
There are many different companies that make hand dryers, and the drying equipment is compared to paper drying.
Washing hands with a hand sanitizer is another method that can be used when travelling if soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-containing hand sanitizers have an alcohol content of 60%.
The health benefit was made mandatory after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis saw its usefulness (1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that remind the hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection decreased with their use.
Hygienic hand washing is at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or gel to wipe and wipe every part of the hands.
The hands should be shaken with a handshake.
If there is debris under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since the germs remain in the water on the hands, it is important to radiate it well and then dry it with a clean towel.
After drying, the water can be used to close the water (and, if necessary, to open the exit door).
It is advisable to avoid lifting your hands from the back of the carpet.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare is to remove the parasite stain and prevent transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that sterilization is not often allowed in healthcare settings, with many doctors and healthcare assistants forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, thus transmitting pests.
A study shows that proper hand washing and other simple procedures reduce the amount of blood flowing through the urine by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper on hand washing and hand rubbing standards in the healthcare sector.
The institution's hand hygiene guidelines are available for public comment on the website.
The most appropriate definition is Whitby et al.
The hand hygiene of the sold devices can be measured and checked, if necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements.
The World Health Organization has "five times to wash your hands":
after contact with blood/body fluids
before you are engaged in work that causes pollution, and
After the patient has been treated. Chemical disinfectant soap ("medicinal soap" or "insecticide") also acts as a disinfectant when washing hands.
Such a sterilization action may be required before surgery or in the area where the infection is most likely to be treated. The hand dryer should be rubbed, if necessary, the tube opened and closed without contact, some chlorhexidine or iodine washed, a clean towel to dry the hands after washing, and a clean scrub brush and other cleaning materials to clean the under nails.
All makeup must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and hands first up to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
No long rubbing time (10 minutes) is required.
When carrying water, the water in the hand wash should be prevented from falling back into the hands.
After washing your hands, you should wash your hands with a clean cloth and wear a handkerchief.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after treating the sick person.
To control staphylococcal infection in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand washing is found to be 20% from the first wash, and slightly less when the regular wash exceeds 35% from the first wash.
Washing with regular soap is three times more effective at eliminating foodborne bacterial infections than washing with disinfectant soap. Compared with hand washing with alcohol and hand washing with disinfectant soap for an average of 30 seconds each, it was found that hand washing with alcohol reduced bacteria by 26% compared to disinfectant soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol hand wipes in reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium that can fall on the hands. Hand hygiene measures in healthcare facilities may include teaching staff about hand washing, increasing access to alcohol hand wipes, and writing and speaking reminders to staff.
Further studies are needed to determine which are best suited to different healthcare systems.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered the cheapest, essential element to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, because of the scarcity of water, soap and sanitation facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces, it is difficult to eliminate the global practice of sanitation.
For example, in rural Africa there are often few private amusement parks or public sidewalks, although it is the cheapest option to build a recreation area.
But, unhappiness is a behavior that we inherit from a lack of soap and water.
Raising awareness and promoting happiness through soap can influence policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of happiness and lead to long-term societal behavioural change.
To achieve this effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
Evaluation of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing happiness in LMICs, while social awareness campaigns are less effective.One example of happiness awareness in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Method" which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure that students enjoy soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum score is reached, the school will remove the top three stars.
The creation of happy places can be part of the awareness-raising campaigns on happiness to reduce childhood illness and mortality.
The International Day of Happiness is another example of creating awareness to change attitudes.Due to the coronavirus pandemic 2019-20, UNICEF is running a campaign to address happiness.
Several studies have looked at cheaper ways to measure happiness in developing countries in relation to DALYs applications.
However, one of the recommended ways of promoting handwashing is that soap is more valuable and effective than other water and sanitation activities.
The importance of hand sanitizer for human health  especially for people in vulnerable situations such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two leading hand hygienists: Hungarian-born doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, who in English means "the founder of the modern hand hygienist".
At that time, people often believed that infection was caused by an odor called asthma.
In the 1980s, infections caused by food and healthcare-related infections led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively start raising awareness of hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of soap consumption to prevent disease.
For example, leaflets about "the right happiness technique" have been posted on the sidewalks of public places and on the sidewalks of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term "wash one's hands" for something comes from denying one's responsibility to promote something or to share it.
It comes from the Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the condemnation of Jesus Christ, but it became a broader term and was widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to forcefully wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse the stain of imagination, representing her guilty conscience for the crimes she committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or performing a conscious act, wash their hands more often than before, and try to value the items of entertainment more than before.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a procedure are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" activities, such as voluntary.
Religions define chastity and cleanliness in an exemplary way. The symbol of happiness, using non-soapy water to make oneself happy, is included in the happiness of many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilah yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe happiness, especially certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require that you celebrate the coming of the bride.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require that you have a blessing before and after a meal.
COVID-19 workplace risk management is the application of occupational safety and health measures to control hazards to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The correct way to control risks at the workplace depends on the workplace and the jobs, the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the extent of the illness in the community, and the risk situations of individual workers who are at risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), reducing the risk of people being injured on the job will reduce the transmission of work between the public and co-workers, which requires basic measures to prevent the spread of infection, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, have respiratory illness, and regular hygiene and disinfection practices at the workplace.
Some of the high-risk occupations include people who are required to have contact with or be close to unknown or suspected COVID-19 people, but who may have contracted the infection from the community while traveling abroad.
These include employees who have reached the general public such as schools, crowded workplaces and public shops.
Risk prevention for this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, including respirators that use highly efficient air purifiers, protection from other people's intrusions, and having personal protective equipment available if a person comes in contact with someone who has COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and senior workers who have been reached by unknown or suspected COVID-19 individuals to be at high risk, which increases the risk if the employee has a collective procedure, or collects or processes samples, of a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
The workers' control of damage, including the technical control of the negative pressure air purification room, and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment at work.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a negative impact on the workplace.
The employee may be absent from work because of illness, the possibility that he will have to take care of someone else, or the fear of an accident.
The business model, the goods needed, and the way to obtain these goods can vary (e.g. buying at a wrong time or buying at home or in a car).
Finally, products from areas highly affected by COVID-19 may be subject to interference. An infectious preparedness and response plan can be used to guide you on precautions to take.
Plan for responding to risks in different workplaces and occupations, including the places of employment, hazardous situations at home and in the community, and individual workplace hazardous situations such as old age or long-term health problems.
They also describe the needs to respond to these threats, and the escape plan in case of an epidemic situation.
Pre-treatment and response plans for infectious diseases may require or change the recommendations.
Effective responses to the spread of disease include reducing the transmission of the disease among employees, protecting people who are at the highest risk of adverse health effects, running a business, and reducing the negative impact of purchasing from other companies.
The resistance of the community in which the business is located affects the response.
The system of work that is based on the use of occupational safety and health in order to effectively control group risks is a system of work that is as advanced as the control of harm.
Where the effects of COVID-19 cannot be limited, the most effective way to control it is by implementing controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Controls include preventing workers from being exposed to hazards at work without compromising the workers' behaviour and can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative control is a change in the system or regulation that requires the employee or employer to take action.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than making and implementing a control, but it can prevent some infections.
All PPE must be selected for the risks to workers, be well ventilated and suitable (e.g. breathing), be worn regularly and appropriately, be regularly inspected, repaired and replaced, and be properly disposed of, cleaned, stored or disposed of to prevent infection.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those that are accessible to fewer people and coworkers.
The basic preventive measures recommended for all workplaces include regular and proper hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, have respiratory illness, including cough and sneeze, providing a sanitary towel and a rubbish dispenser, preparing them to work elsewhere or adjusting the work schedule if necessary, educating employees to use tools and equipment together, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
Removing and placing the person in a place where infection can occur is an important step to protect employees, customers, visitors and other people at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms stay home until the fever, symptoms, and other symptoms have disappeared for at least 24 hours without taking medications to reduce or reverse the fever, and have a flexible sick leave policy, which allows employees to stay home and care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these regulations.
According to OSHA, low-risk jobs include those where people are in constant contact or contact with people less than six feet (1.8 m) away from unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, but who may have SARS-CoV-2 as a contagious disease in the business area, or who have personally traveled to another area of suspected COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have left public places such as schools, high-traffic workplaces, and crowded shopping areas.Controls for high-risk groups include creating better air purifiers, increasing the volume of air purifiers, making things like plastic that can be scratched and held in place, and creating a window to protect the occupant of the vehicle.Management measures for high-risk groups include putting protective gear on sick workers at home, changing the way they use personal protective equipment, stopping work when they are in danger, and using face masks and protective gear when they are in danger of being exposed to COVID-19.These include planning to wear protective gear, providing information to employees who are in workplaces, and providing personal protective gear, if they are unable to walk or walk, and protective gear and protective gear to protect workers from the effects of COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group do not use their breathing apparatus.
If a person becomes ill on board, the best way to control the staff and other passengers is to remove the person from the other passengers and then to a distance of 6 feet, to prescribe a person with a serious illness, to give a mask to the sick person or to ask the patient to rub his or her nose and mouth with a bandage when coughing or sneezing.
The airline staff wears medical gloves that are only used when they are serving a sick passenger or when they are in contact with a fluid or in areas where germs may be present, and additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent coughing or difficulty breathing.
For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, prevention measures include postponing the departure of the sick person, putting the person in isolation, and providing medical care as soon as the person has fever or other illnesses while on board.
In schools and childcare centres, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person has come to school regardless of whether they have been exposed to the community.
In the case of a moderate or severe infection, social distancing measures are applied such as cancelling study trips, meetings, and other public gatherings such as co-education or art classes or meals at the cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, coordinating arrival and departure times, limiting unnecessary visits, and using a separate medical office elsewhere for children with symptoms such as a cold.
When there is a high need for infection in the local community, in addition to the social distancing fee, extending the school closure is considered.
Police officers who are approaching people who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as emergency medical technicians, including personal protective equipment.
If they reach the person's hands, the employee must clean and disinfect the work belt and equipment with household cleaning spray or wipe before reusing them, and follow the normal work procedure of removing dirt and throwing away used PPE, including dirty clothes, in the laundry.
OSHA considers that some healthcare and death rates are too high or that the risk of infection is high.
Jobs with a high risk of being taken away include providing healthcare, support, laboratory, and medical transportation personnel who have been infected or suspected of having COVID-19.
This becomes more dangerous if the employee is doing work, or working on taking or testing a sample, of a suspected or known COVID-19 patient.
The general procedure includes the diagnosis, the form of cough, bronchoscopies, certain dental treatments and laboratory tests, or the taking of a hard sample.
Highly risky jobs include those who prepare the remains of known or suspected COVID-19 patients at the time of death; these are at higher risk if they are performing a dead body operation.Additional technical controls for at-risk groups include the confinement of known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including general work performed at the time.
Special negative pressure can be done in healthcare facilities and in cemeteries.
The sample must be labelled with a Biosafety Level 3 label.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who are admitted to isolation depending on suspected COVID-19 infection. As with other PPE, OSHA recommends that respirators be kept within 6 feet of known, suspected, or infected patients with SARS-CoV-2, and people who provide general medical care.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respiratory masks with filters are used for good, documented breathing in surveillance programs including testing for wear, dialysis, and medical laboratories.
Other forms of respiration can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend full face coverings, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only when the staff is in the laboratory.
For people who take respiratory samples, care for, or infect COVID-19 patients without a general treatment, WHO recommends wearing surgical masks, gloves, or face coverings, as well as wearing a scarf and gloves.
If the treatment is likely to cause an infection, the surgical mask will be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.
As access to PPE is limited in symptoms, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE by providing hearing and visual therapy to people, using it as a clean window, making it easier for all those involved in direct care to access the room where the COVID-19 patient is, using only essential PPE for specific tasks, continuing to use the same face mask without removing it while treating patients with a disability, monitoring and combining the purchase of PPE, and advising people to use face masks for the disabled.
On March 4, 2020, I declared a State of Emergency in California due to the COVID-19 threat.

LINE OF THEME: [Covid-19] Stress and preparation for the future
The date/time of the event: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No number is mentioned
We were in a very difficult situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to the global humanity and responsibility of each other.
We can't stop the spread of this disease, but we know a reliable way to respond from the grassroots, the workplace and build the global community that is the driving force behind this organization.
This shows the dedication and commitment we've seen from all of our staff through email, chat and chat, which is a huge testament to the amazing people we've been lucky enough to work with.
There's nothing to boast about that we all work together.
Last week, someone posted a thank you for our work.
It reminded me of how effective it is for the world to have Wikipedia in this day and age, and the powerful signal that a valuable source of information is online and available to everyone.
Your job will be viable if the website is maintained or if our employees are paid a salary or social security.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
Right now, not only what we do, but how we do it, is having a huge impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this work and your contribution, we will make significant improvements to the way we work together, starting this week.
We need to organize our work and our schedule.
As previously reported by Robyn, Group-C met earlier in the night to discuss the format and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the discussion, we looked at what we saw as the appropriate response to what we were facing and the best way for the organization to continue at this time.
We want to take this news out of the news and support our work in the long term.
If you need a refresher, that's fine.
All our employees, contractors and contract workers:
I will work 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not issue leave - if you can work regular hours and can be employed.
But, the world is unpredictable at this time, and if you need to take care of a family member, buy food, or go to the doctor, your safety is your priority.
We're not going to take your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
I was Arabic, but they didn't say.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just inform your supervisor and help your team to organize their schedule so that they have time to do important work.
(If you are being advised about COVID-19, please inform Bryan at T&C Ops. T&C can help with support and thus ensure that your condition is properly addressed for management.)
The hourly wage will be paid in full.
We've said before, we're committed to adhering to our contractual obligations and our employee hours.
Everyone will be paid the normal working hours in normal circumstances.
This includes if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use workplace noise reduction in the world.
It pays incredibly well, especially at a time like this.
Again, this is about taking care of yourself.
We only ask that you contact your supervisor, so that we can find out what to expect and then we can improve the work.
Some jobs are considered necessary.
There are things we have to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security, and Team Finance (among other things) are essential tasks that require additional support.
We're going to start a system across all sectors so that we can have the current objectives and then we can focus on supporting our most important work.
There are so many things to do in life, and I'm just going to focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing the amount of waste now will not lead to any residues.
We do not plan to "go to work twice" after the illness has passed.
You are not obliged to work overtime so that you can complete your work in a timetable that is not currently possible.
We have accepted that the situation has changed, and we will set new targets at the right time.
What happened to APP?
In order to organize the new schedule and the expected working hours of the day, we plan to organize the timing of the Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We want to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan so that time is allocated to the budget to allow employees to prioritize essential work, self-care, and family care during the reception of people who need or want to work less time than before in the next few weeks.
This extension of the time limit significantly reduces the workload of the time schedule and the pressure on the entire institution.
We will inform the Committee of our plan next week and update the agency and the teams on the next steps as soon as we confirm.
Thank you to the APP team for leading this.
Office conditions, arrivals and cleaning.
Last week, we learned that one of the staff at SF may have contracted the COVID-19 virus.
But, out of caution, we hired disinfection teams from offices across San Francisco.
Use of disinfectants for the hospital to disinfect the affected areas, as well as the reception and the bathroom.
The building has a care system, which can be used to support the tenants' security.
We are confident that the office will be ready for us when we want to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 system with us and all DC employees.
Last week, our DC office was moved to a fully-home operation in accordance with the guidelines they shared with San Francisco.
As some of our staff in NYC know, we also discussed renting a place in Brooklyn.
This conversation is ongoing but it's late.
Some of our employees are working abroad for the first time.
Our long-term employees who work from home know that we can fix this, and we would like to give you some advice:
You can limit the meeting time to one or two hours at most.
If you need a longer platform, you can try to break it down into a few days.
At the meeting, as is clearly stated, you must have an agenda and send a report that is read in front of the audience.
You can create live videos, and then use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to share and share.
You will lead the facilitation of each meeting, and someone will follow the discussion with any questions and then keep a list of speakers, and someone will help you take notes (or put together the notes).
You can also send an e-mail to the technical support department if you need a better solution.
You use your best half.
Join the #remotecommunicationsSlack community for colleague discussions about work sharing
The Labour Department Working Group is looking at webinar guidelines to increase the support for the division of labour in the Basic Law.
Last week we asked the community to get a stay of Wikimedia fundraising events, such as editing, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we understood that our application was suspended and other restrictions could be imposed on the payment of the approved donation for the activities and that no one should be penalized for delaying or changing these promises.
Next week we will follow up on more Wikimedia and other communities and community forums.
The overall pattern of global communities seems to be a bit frustrating for disruption, but we believe in the transparency and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and the like.
In addition, CRT is working to create a Meta-Wiki site to provide a community space to track our impact and track our relationships.
Monitoring of COVID-19-related matters
We will send out invitations to a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide more information, answer questions and spend more time connecting with others.
We are here and we will help in any way.
At this time, you are working to get this email, and other relevant information related to COVID-19, to the Wiki Office.
The CRT will work on putting this page and all the information in one place.
We also work to stay in touch with workers in countries that are currently undergoing a major impact.
If you have any questions about travel, events, live work broadcasts, or online tutorials, or if you need anything else, please do not hesitate to contact CRT.
We are here to help and work with you as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan - Public Employment Manager at the Department of Labour.
None of these changes should be seen as a burden on our work and our duties.
But, there is the recognition of this time, and the jobs and responsibilities are likely to be as accustomed as they were before.
There are steps we think are necessary to support our movement so that we can continue to work, and that our movement provides the support they need, and the services they depend on.
Our planned work will be there when the time comes.
In this moment, it's time for us to support each other and plan out the critical work for the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to make that happen, and we want all of you to take care of yourselves and your families so that we can help you when the need comes.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused by COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), which is an infectious respiratory disease that was first detected in December 2019, in Wigan, Hubei, Jayna.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7) which makes it a better drug and thus targets heart disease. ACE2 is also a gateway to some coronavirus cells.
The non-human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiostensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the endothelial surface and in other tissues.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidease M2 region and a C-terminal amino-linkage region.
ACE2 is the only type I protein that has an enzymatically active region that reaches the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular region of ACE2 is embedded in the cell region that takes up the enzyme called shettase, which makes a metabolic protein and passes into the bloodstream to break down the urine.
ACE2 is present in most cells: ACE2 attacks the cell wall of the lung, alveolar type II cells, enterocytes in the small intestine, various vascular and endothelial cells and muscle cells in most tissues.
The ACE2mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain cells.
The first function of ACE2 is to balance ACE.
The ACE hormone cleaves angiotensin I from the muscle coil of angiotensin II.
ACE2 is taken up by carboxyl-terminal amino acids of phenylalanine angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-lle-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed by the vasodalitor angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-lle-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 also takes up a number of other peptides including [des-arg9] - bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the flow of neutral amino acid derivatives from SLC6A19 that are then reported in Hartnup disease.
As a cell transport protein, ACE2 is the main cell entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the combination of the elevation of the S1 receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the ACE2 enzymatic region of the cell surface from endocytosis and the transmission of the virus and enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This entire process requires the activation of TMPRSS2 serine-like protein S-butter, which is taken from the nose and is currently being investigated as a natural protein. This may lead to hypotheses that it reduces ACE2 levels in the cell, which may help fight pain.
However, many professional societies and regulatory organizations have recommended continuing the standard of ACE and ARB treatment.
A continuous assessment and iron evaluation published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE respirators was associated with a 34% significant reduction in the risk of lung disease compared to control".
Also, "the risk of lung disease may also be reduced in patients receiving ACE respiratory therapy who are therefore at higher risk of developing pain, especially in people with musculoskeletal and heart disease.
The use of ACE in respiratory failure associated with lung disease decreases the risk of death, although the use of anesthesia is much less effective than the overall risk of lung disease".
The combination of the ACE2 (rhACE2) receptor is generally used for novel treatment of severe lung injury, and to improve hemodynamics of pulmonary and density oxidation in pigs with severe respiratory symptoms with lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in isolation is about 10 hours and is based on the action of 30 minutes of additional 24 hour active period (period).
Several studies suggest that rhACE2 is an effective drug for people who cannot take renin-angiotensin respiratory medication (RAS respiratory medication) or have increased angiotensin II circulation.
b'Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 (Bat SL_CoV-WIV1), also known as SARS-like coronavirus WIV1, is a severe respiratory illness coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) that was then isolated from a washed film of a Jainis (Rhinolophus sinicus).
Various governments have issued or recommended support for local and regional authorities.
Several monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy concerns have arisen, especially in systems based on the location tracking of the app user.
A less common method is to use a Bluetooth light to record the time spent using the other phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be implementing a way to power the Bluetooth app directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
Jayna, the Jayna government, along with Alipay, have developed an app that allows citizens to check if someone has been in close contact with someone with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities and in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and distributed to the government.North Macedonia has developed "StopKorona!", a Bulutuut-powered monitoring app that tracks people with the disease and then provides a quick response from healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that a nearby tracking app for people with COVID-19 is in good condition, and will be available within a week.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering implementing the Singaporean TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace system.Russia is running a local app for COVID-19 residents in Moscow, which is designed to ensure that they stay indoors.
Ross Anderson, an emeritus professor of computer engineering at Cambridge University, has released a list of potential problems with the app-based system, including lying about who owns it and that it is of little value if the app is used by only a small number of people.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple has made a restriction on brands adding coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, which is limited to "officials" or larger organizations.
Google and Amazon have also made similar restrictions.
Activists have expressed concern about the problem that can be caused by mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially if they are designed for building surveillance to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and distributed when the risk is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
The agency has set out eight criteria for public projects:
the supervision is "legal, necessary and appropriate";
where the removal of monitoring and supervision was the key phrase;
the use of the information is limited to COVID-19 purposes only;
the security and confidentiality of the information can be protected to demonstrate that the protection is based on evidence;
digital surveillance can prevent discrimination and harassment;
information to be shared with others must be regulated by law;
there must be protection against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
The effective participation of all "interested parties" will be needed, including public health experts and targeted groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also issued a watchlist.
The plan recommended by Google/Apple is designed to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the ability to monitor devices on their systems when not needed.
Some countries use a local network to track apps, which eliminates the need to download apps and the ability to track.
In Israel, the web monitoring system has been approved.
Network solutions from the same places have a future password problem.
However, all systems with a central server need access to user location information; many privacy-protected systems have been developed that use a central server to communicate with each other (see section below).
In South Korea, there is a system without an app to monitor proximity.
Instead of using a separate app, the system collects tracking data from various locations including tracking data from mobile devices and card purchases, and then sends out alerts and text messages to potential infected people.
Along with the use of proximity alert information, the government also makes location information available to everyone, sometimes permitted because it is difficult to change the data privacy law after the MERS pandemic hit the country.
This information is available in a number of apps and websites.In countries including Germany, the company checks which systems are protected by passwords and which are accessible to everyone.
As of April 6, 2020, no details have been released.
The password-protected tracking is a broad concept, which was developed on the basis of a large data study that has been going on since 2013. On 7 April 2020, a group of dozens of experts were working on a password-protective solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to find the location of other people's phones.
However, PEPP-PT integrates the efforts in a single and distributed manner, not a single method.The single-point system includes the Secure and Leaked Secure Area Monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Access Number (TCN, CEN), the Sensitive Encryption and Mobile Access Monitoring (PACT) and others.
In these systems, the processing of personal data does not go beyond the platform, and all the processes take place on the platform.
The MIT Media Lab's Privacy team developed SafePaths, a platform for using password protection techniques when collecting and retrieving data from a site or logging together to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
In addition to the study from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Safeguarding Privacy in the Cloud", another similar effort on the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a technology company that was originally developed at MIT Media Lab, will be released in March 2020.
SafeTrace uses software technology that enables users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising data confidentiality.
April 5, 2020, The global TCN partnership, founded by groups of like-minded and overlapping systems, aims to reduce congestion, and facilitate global integration of monitoring and alerting apps, a key way to achieve widespread implementation.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had launched the BlueTrace system using the official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced a proximity monitoring program, which was said to protect privacy, and which combined low-power Bluetooth technology and password protection software.
They also broadcast the content of the space technology used by the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is designed to be three-faced:
The hardware sector enables the government to create a coronavirus tracking app that officially protects privacy.
Google and Apple plan to respond to the monitoring problem by first distributing the system and updating the system to accept it, and then removing it when the vulnerability disappears in the same way.
The development of a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is still underway to eliminate the 2019-20 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
This is one line of scientific research that is currently being used to develop a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other studies are in the pipeline including the development of a vaccine and a blood clot for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 protein drugs, each with multiple n ligand-linked sites.
The evaluation of these combined sites provides a reasonable prediction for the development of an effective COVID-19 virus-killing protein.
Among the main target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymersare, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.

The WHO has added lopinavir/ritonavir to the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus.Gilead Sciences later developed Remdesivir which had in vitro pharmacological functions against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and coronaviruses.
One problem is that treatments designed to resist change can lead to several diseases and seizures.
Some studies on remdesivir show that it has a high skin barrier resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two being conducted at Cleveland University Hospitals; one on people with mild pain and one on those with severe pain.
There is a clinical trial underway on taking vitamin C in people hospitalized and with severe COVID-19 illnesses; two placebo-controlled (Jayna, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

It is not yet clear what the conditions during pregnancy may be, including diabetes, heart disease, hypercoagulability or erection, which increase the risk for pregnant women as it is for non-pregnant women.
Although no vaccine has been fully tested, there are several ongoing trials to develop a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a deadly virus, to be available in the next 18 months.
Five vaccines were selected for Phase I of the April safety study.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A global pandemic in 2020, which led to funding and many governments conducting research to get a vaccine.
Many organizations are using insecticides to make SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
As announced in April, the CEPI program will develop the vaccine together and then move forward with speed, production capacity, mass production, and worldwide availability.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 technology platforms are under study to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine during early 2020.
The main seminars aim to develop the safety of Phase I of the study, including:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I is the development and production of the selected vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
the viral form (stage I vaccination and emergence: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 factor)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 vaccine combinations were developed from the initial development of the vaccine, and 78 projects are underway (79, according to the Milken Institute), 37 others were reported, but little information is available (about which it is reported that it is planned or designed).
Phase I-II of a planned safety and immunogenicity trial in a laboratory, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site, with a clear, limited efficacy finding.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and have a lower efficacy of the drug, with the negative effects of drug abuse.
Of the 79 vaccines in progress (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 are still not being evaluated in humans (still in "pre-trial" study).
As of 24 January 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced research on a potential molecular vaccine that would modify the viral protein carrier skin to produce an immune response.

In late March, the Canadian government announced it would invest C$275 million in 96 research projects to combat COVID-19, including several targeted vaccines run by Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan programs.
Up to that time, the Canadian government has announced C$192 million specifically for COVID-19 vaccines, and plans to create a national "vaccine stockpile" of several new vaccines that can be used for the next coronavirus outbreak when it arrives.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine being tested on mice, which they said "MNA provides the SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine and thus a specific antigen for the antibody response [in mice] which then starts 2 weeks after injection".
Canada 16 April 2020, University of Waterloo Department of Medicine announced that it had developed a DNA vaccine that can be taken from the nose.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to convert bacteria into harmless and virally resistant bacteria, which can make the immune system produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities joined forces to create a dedicated IB computer, whose data is stored on the resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some monuments have a single function, also called an indeterminate function.
This means that it can be more beneficial than just preventing the disease.
The additional randomized trial in Austria is intended to control the enrollment of 4,170 healthcare workers.
It is possible that the vaccine developed is unsafe or ineffective.
Preliminary studies evaluating the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific COVID-19 animals, such as mice injected with ACE2, other animal laboratories, and non-human subjects, show that level 3 safety is the epidemiological measure for working with a live virus, and international cooperation to ensure systemic safety standards.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-invasive ways.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or vaccines to protect us from SARS that have been found to be safe and effective for humans.
According to the study reports published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and health sector bodies around the world.
When MERS emerged, it was seen that existing research on SARS could provide an effective framework for developing vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there was a (DNA) MERS vaccine that completed Phase I of non-human trials, and three others are underway, all of which are viral vaccines, two viral adenovirals (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one viral MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
A notice was posted on the community board to inform that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and a vaccine has been developed.
The companies posted on various social media the company's first series of hide-and-seek vaccines against other coronavirus diseases such as SARS coronavirus.
b' Coronavirus is a group of related viruses that are transmitted by rodents and birds.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, tightness of the throat, bad breath, and stomach pain.
The time taken for the onset of symptoms is usually up to five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although it usually causes mild pain, there may be viral pneumonia and many cells stop working.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is first transmitted from person to person through close contact, and even through spit drops from an infected person when coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Although these droplets are caused by respiration, they usually occur on the ground or on the affected areas where they would otherwise be removed.
Many people can get it by touching a contaminated surface or by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in a place for up to 72 hours.
It is most common in lice in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it is possible to transmit it earlier without symptoms.The most common method of diagnosis is the sequence transcription of the polymerase response (rRT-PCR) in a tissue sample.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of masks for the general public vary, with some authorities warning against their use, others recommending their use, and others making it mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or drug for treating the COVID-19 virus.
Long-term transmission of the disease was reported in most of the countries in all six WHO regions.
These infections are viruses that are resistant to the virus or cause flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Symptoms may include breathing difficulties, persistent pain or pressure in the knees, numbness, stiffness in the legs, and blueness of the face or back; it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur.
In less common cases, severe respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, runny nose or clogged throat may occur.
Stomach symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were observed in varying amounts.
In some cases, Jayna was initially diagnosed with back pain and a strong heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can be lung disease, failure of tissue transplantation, and even death.
This is called the period without symptoms.
The symptom-free period of COVID-19 is usually short and can be five to six days, while most can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms live 11.5 days after being infected.
The role of these symptoms in the spread of the disease is not yet known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they contribute to the spread of the disease.
The number of people with symptoms is unknown as of the time of the study, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said that 20% of all confirmed cases have symptoms while in hospital.
The National Health Commission of Jayna started adding symptomatic cases to the cases daily from April 1; and of 166 people infected that day, 130 (78%) had symptoms at the time of diagnosis.
Some coughs and spit can carry a large number of viruses.
So a large number of scores will produce more points than a small number.
A study in Singapore found that a cough with no mouthwash can fly up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus does not melt in the air, the National Institute of Science reports that transmission by bioserosol is possible and that air collectors in potatoes outside public rooms have been found to contain RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), may involve the person being forced to breathe out, which can then cause the air to be dispersed.
Although patients are concerned about the spread of the virus through feces, the risk is considered low. The virus is most likely to spread to people with symptoms; although it is possible to spread to people without symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Union Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although it is not clear how easily the disease is transmitted, it usually infects two to three people per person.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus can survive on the surface of cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) for three days and on metal (AISI, 304) for four hours at 99% copper.
This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent also affect if used correctly; soap destroys the viral layer that protects the surface, as well as removes the virus from the skin and the areas on it.
Alternative solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a germ killer), are less effective.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken with medication for two days after being admitted to hospital.
In five to six patients, the first sample was found to have a higher viral load, and the sixth patient was found to have a higher viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe novel coronavirus respiratory syndrome, the first three people who were placed in isolation had acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan.
All novel forms of SARS-CoV-2 virus related to coronavirus in nature.
Outside the body, the virus is killed with household soap, which bursts through the protective layer.
The lungs are the most affected cell by COVID-19 as the virus can enter the cell and convert the angiotensin-converting enzyme into enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a high-density glycoprotein called peplomer to bind to ACE2 and all host cells.
Severe heart injury is seen in 12% of patients admitted to Wuhan, Jena, and is more common in severe cases.
Heart attacks are also more common, causing inflammation and interference with the immune system during the process, but severe myocardial injury can also be associated with the ACE2 receptor.
ACE2 receptors are commonly found in the heart, and they can cause heart failure.
An increase in the incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolis (25%) was observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 disease and may be related to their poor health.Effective testing on COVID-19 deceased individuals was found to have alveolar damage (DAD), and in which lymphocytes contained inflammation of the lung's sensory filter.
Although SARS-COV-2 has ACE2-specific tropism in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of inflammatory systemic inflammation.
Specifically, GM-CSF-perforating T-cell disease has been found to be associated with the introduction of IL-6 flame injectors and the severity of lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic inflammation was also detected in the autopsy.
WHO has released several tests done on the disease.
The official method of testing is to replace the polymerase response transcript (rRT-PCR).
The test is only performed on the sample of the pus that has been taken with a nasal brush; however, a sample of the pus or feces can also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood can also be used, but it will require two blood samples taken at two weeks' intervals and the result will be somewhat negative.
Genetic scientists have isolated a coronavirus cell and removed its skin so that international laboratories can independently perform a laboratory reaction (PCR) to detect the virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, an anti-fungal test (which detects active infection and whether a person has already been infected) was developed, but has not yet been widely used.
A genetic laboratory test showed accuracy of 60 to 70%.
The US FDA approved the first-line treatment lab on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of the month.Labor guidelines were published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for the recommended diagnostic method then based on the clinical test model of epidemic risk.
Several double-sided tibial subclavian opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical posterior and widely distributed opacities are the most common.
Subpleural hypertrophy, severe septal lobe differentiation, and ear infections can be painful.
There is little information available about the focus and the disease of COVID-19.
The most common symptoms of dementia are:
Mascroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism and swelling of the lungs
Four more severe strains of the virus were observed:
Some pulmonary pain: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte inflammation, a wide variety of inflammation, inflammation of the intestine with lymphocytic fluid and multinucleated lymphocytes from the synaptic cell.
acute lung disease: the effects of alveolar entry are excluded.
DAD causes severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemia.
heat stroke: what does the removal of the alveolar membrane and the snail's intestines do
Blood: closed muscular division (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce infection include staying away from places with crowds, washing hands frequently with soap and water and rubbing hands for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene and avoiding unnecessary contact with eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends that you use a mouth-nose mask when coughing or sneezing and use an inner elbow if you do not have a cleaning mask.
The right feeling after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends using a clean cloth and face covering when outdoors, to reduce the transmission of personal information. Social distancing is intended to reduce transmission from people who frequently congregate at school and work, limit movement and avoid large gatherings.
The guidelines for social distancing include that people should be within 6 feet (1.8 meters) of each other.
There is no known cure for COVID-19. And a vaccine is not expected to be available until early 2021, an important part of managing COVID-19 is to slow the spread of the disease, known as "flow reduction".
The CDC recommends that you often soak in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when you are washing your hands, before cooking, and after you have flushed, chewed or vomited.
It is also recommended to use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content, but only when soap and water are not available.
In this preparation, the antimicrobial activity is carried out by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial irritation from alcohol; it is "not an active substance".
Glycerol is added to the humectant.
People are administered supervised care, which includes fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support of other cells affected by the virus.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of having the virus wear a mask.
Extracororeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used as a response to respiratory problems, but its usefulness is still being investigated.
Personal hygiene and a healthy and nutritious lifestyle are said to enhance immunity.
Supportive medicine can be helpful for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The WHO and the National Health Commission of India have issued recommendations for protecting people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intestinal and lung physicians have combined American treatments recommended and obtained from various agencies into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend that acetaminophen be preferred to ibuprofen first.
Care must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the healthcare system when performing treatments that can cause respiratory distress, such as intubation or hand breathing.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that people be placed in an Infection Isolation Room (IIC) in addition to the usual precautions, contact with people and ventilation precautions.The CDC said guidelines for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE, respirator or mask, eye protection and gloves. When available, respirator (instead of mask) is preferred.
N95 masks were approved for this function but the FDA issued an Emergency Use Approval (EUA) for use as masks.
They are intended to prevent respiratory diseases such as asthma, but they are effective against all organisms but cannot be guaranteed for all uses.
If a mask is not available, the CDC recommends wearing a mask or, if nothing else is available, having a mask made at home.
Most of the time COVID-19 is not very severe or does not change its pattern at all, but in a few cases it does.
The types of respiratory support for COVID-19 are associated with respiratory failure and are well studied in people in hospital, with evidence showing that self-injection can be prevented with nasal spray or two-stage ventilation.
It is not known whether these two treatments are equally beneficial for the patient.
Some doctors prefer to stay at home for respiratory therapy when it is available, as this method limits respiratory transmission compared to nasal spraying.
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds for their population, which would be a limitation of the health system's capacity if the number of people with severe COVID-19 suddenly increases and require hospitalization.
One study in Jayna found that 5% of people in the intensive care unit, 2.3% needed a respiratory aid machine, and 1.4% died.
And, an average of 30% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 were eventually referred to the ICU.
The respiratory system is complicated as respiratory disease (ARDS) increases with the increase of COVID-19 and oxygen uptake becomes more difficult.
A respirator capable of controlling the pressure pattern and high PEEP were needed to maximize oxygenation to reduce respiratory risks associated with lung and preumothorax injury.
The high PEEP is not the same as the old respirators.
A study shows that treatment will begin in January 2020, with clinical trials of antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most useful.
While new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, several of these drugs have already been tested and approved for other uses or are initially in high-profile.
Antiviral medicines can be tested on people with severe illnesses.
The WHO said that people with autism are participating in trials of the efficacy and safety of future treatments.The FDA has granted temporary approval for convalescent plasma, which is an experimental treatment for when a person's condition is very serious or requires urgent treatment.
There are no clinical trials yet to demonstrate its efficacy in pain.
In February 2020, Jayna created an app to work with the pandemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can monitor 'people in close proximity' using surveillance information and potential transmission risks.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential danger is detected, the app not only recommends lockdown, but also alerts local authorities.It edits a lot of data including phone calls, facial recognition, mobile tracking and technology is used to track infected people and people in close proximity in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed a mental health agency to monitor mobile phones of suspected coronavirus cases.
Measures have been taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who have been in close contact with infected people.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared location information with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, so that they could screen for and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to track people who have broken their quarantine order.
Italian Environmental Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera told the phone company that "40% of people are free to move around as they please".
The German Observatory conducted a 48-hour computer-based survey of more than 42,000 people over two days of vacations.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has issued an international call for solutions to the coronavirus outbreak.
People can make noise during quarantine, restrictions on travel, adverse health effects of treatment or fear of infection.
"The increasing isolation of people, loneliness, stress, noise and economic closure are a damaging wind to people's mental health and safety", said BBC's Rory O'Connor.
It can reduce the pain effects with few or no symptoms, which are similar to other respiratory diseases such as the flu.
In the case of minor illnesses, the recovery time is usually two weeks, while in severe cases it can take up to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 as noted in the data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data on COVID-19 is still limited.
In severe cases, COVID-19 can be a severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory distress, acute hematoxicity or paralysis of the tissues.
COVID-19-related problems of blood poisoning, abnormal clots and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormal blood clotting usually increases during blood tests during the period of possible clotting, and is reported to affect 6% of people hospitalized for COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
On average, 20-30% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
The same report said, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days in hospital.
However, the patient transferred to the ICU has a total of seven days between the time of hospital admission and the time of death.
In a study of previous cases, the time from mild symptoms to death is 14 days, which is a maximum of 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in Jena, the mortality rate for men is 2.8% and for women it is 1.7%.
Histopathological analysis of a lung sample examined with alveolar inspiration of removed fubromyx in the lungs.
The mutation of the virus was mutated to cause disease.
The lung scan showed severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of India, heart damage was found to be caused by increased troponin or heart failure.
According to data from March in the United States, 89% of people hospitalized had pre-existing illnesses.
The average education varies according to the circumstances and the local environment, but also because of the complexity of the structure.
The reduction in the number of minor cases that lead to death is greatly exaggerated.
However, since the deaths occurred sooner, the mortality rate for this time period is reduced.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have more COVID-19 illnesses and an average of 2.4 times more likely to have higher care or die than non-smokers.
The administration of a Hong Kong hospital found that the lung capacity of people who recovered from the disease had decreased by 20% to 30%, and a lung scan showed cell damage.
This can also lead to negative effects on well-being.
Until March 2020, it will be known whether other diseases and long-term immunosuppressive diseases are caused by infections.
There may be no harm, based on other coronavirus behavior, but cases that recovered from COVID-19 were followed by a positive coronavirus sample that was later reported.
These cases are considered to worsen the infection and may become a recurrent infection.
The virus is considered to be of natural animal origin, which is an infection.
The official source of the disease is unknown, but in December 2019 the outbreak was completely human-to-human.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020, The Lancet, reported that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
An official statement by WHO said that the symptoms began on 8 December 2019.
Several well-known measures of capital punishment have been developed.
These figures vary from region to region and from time to time and can be affected by the size of the laboratory, the quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, the time to onset and the pattern of the disease such as age, sex and general health.
In late 2019, WHO listed in ICD-10 the disease code U07.1 for deaths based on laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths in health facilities or COVID-19 epidemic disease tests based on laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Hopkins University statistics, the death rate from the most common cases is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number may vary from region to region. Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which is the number of people who have died from the disease, and the mortality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.
It is possible that we do not have time to follow a specific sample of cases of recovery.
Although not all people have antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the most populous area of Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of about 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) died.
In the evening, the disease spread through a carnival event, spreading to younger people, resulting in a small number of deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths were attributed to the disease.
Also, the German healthcare system is not in a bad shape.
In fact, only about 3% had antibodies, according to the donor.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The effect of disease and mortality is not very different between men and women.
The death rate is higher in men than in women in Jena and Italy.
The risk is higher in men over 50, and the difference between men and women is only 90.
In addition, the mortality rate was reported to be 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of the gender difference is unknown, but the gender and behaviour may be the cause.
Gender-based immunodeficiency differences, less smoking among women and the fact that men have fewer erectile dysfunction disorders than women have thus contributed to more male mortality.
In Europe, 57% of male infected persons and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the US government did not track the COVID-19 ethnic death data.
A study shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS behave differently in men and women.
A large number of healthcare workers, especially healthcare assistants, are women, and they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus, D stands for disease and 19 stands for the first time the pandemic was seen: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid the ambiguity of a disease (such as Jayna), an animal species or a group of people, a gas in accordance with international recommendations for the purpose of naming to eliminate discrimination.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus that causes COVID-19" when issuing reports.
Both the disease and the virus are called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were known as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019 nCoV severe respiratory illness be temporary names for the virus and disease in line with 2015 guidelines not to use the term in place of the disease and virus name.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were made on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations on the sales volume, some digital industries have printed healthcare products such as swab swabs and respirator components.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently ordered a respirator kit, and lacked the necessary equipment at the time, a local startup developed and printed 100 taps in one night.
Since the first COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a lot of confusion, misinformation and false information about the origin, dosage, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that is urgently needed online.
You don't seem to have any more power than some other animals.
The virus was not detected in pigs, chickens, and chickens.
It does not have any approved medicines or vaccines.
International studies of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines are underway by institutions and governments, academic groups and research departments.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "WORLD TRY" to evaluate the effectiveness of prescription drugs for viruses that were then said to be virulent.
Maybe a vaccine, but various agencies are working on getting vaccinated.
The early functions of SARS-CoV were exploited as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter the host cell.
There are three stages of the vaccination that are being tested.
First, the goal of researchers is to develop a vaccine for all viruses.
The use of this type of virus, either inactive or dead, is intended to stimulate the immune response of the body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second step, with the vaccine, is to detect the sensitivity of the immune system to certain viruses that have been observed.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focus on S-protein enhancement that helps the virus to carry the ACE2 enzyme.
The third vaccine is the nuclear vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technology for making vaccines).
A pilot vaccine developed with a single ingredient will be tested for safety and effectiveness.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless skin copy of the virus that causes the disease. It increases antibodies which claim to be a barrier to making a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but is controversial.
There are more than 300 clinical trials in progress as of April 2020.
Several trials have been evaluated and approved for malate, including studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reuse of antiviral drugs was the focus of the Jayneys study, which passed nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries and was reported in late April.
Widespread criticism of the clinical establishment of a COVID-19 vaccine and medication developed, April 2020. Several early antiviral drugs were considered for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hyroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta.
This effect is seen in the decrease in remdesivir, as of March 2020.
There has been a remarkable improvement in the health of patients when remdesivir was used in a gentle manner.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in the United States, China, and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used in the treatment of marine mammals, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
But, there is a call for peer researchers to look at it.
The Korean Health Administration and JINA recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virus Foundation, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, said that twice the normal dose is more than the risk of harm.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine approved by a doctor treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Jayna guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use with COVID-19.
Preliminary information suggests that a liquid dose of ribavirin is taken through the nose for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitrozoxanide was recommended for future use in vivo studies after low respiratory resistance was observed in SARS-CoV-2.Studies on the pre-expansion protein serane-transferase inhibitor protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are essential for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the ACE2 receptor interaction.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxchloroquine with or without azithromycin was too limited to justify the public health community's approval of this treatment without a study.Oseltamivir does not limit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro transmission and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unknown.
Cyclonic cyclones can be a problem in the later stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine activity. Tocilizumab is also included in the National Health Board's guidelines for Jena treatment after the study is completed.
If Phase 2 is not a nationwide extermination experiment in Italy after being observed in the testes of people with severe pain.
The combination of serum ferritin with a blood test to detect cytocin storm, represents an artificial antibody, which is thought to cause death in some people who take it.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on the results of a study of the treatment of the cytokine steroid it produces that causes inflammation, CAR T cell therapy, 2017.
So far, there is no randomized, controlled trial of tocilizuman for the treatment of CRS infection.
The administration of clean and concentrated antibodies to the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those in need is being tested in a non-vaccination and ongoing immunity approach.
This fee was treated for SARS with incomplete results.
The virus mutation in the desired mode of action of sleep antibody therapy can be immediately transmitted to SARS-CoV-2.
Other methods, however, such as cell cytotoxicity-dependent antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other forms of anti-aging therapy, for example monoclonal antibodies, are also used.
Convalescent serum, which consists of a liquid portion of blood taken from a patient that contains specific antibodies to the virus, can increase the rate of formation.
Coronavirus, a very close-knit group of diseases
