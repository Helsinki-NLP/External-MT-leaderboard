When an English speaker realizes that the foreigner he is speaking to does not understand something he is saying, he repeats the same thing, but louder, as if the person were deaf. At no point does he realize that his choice of words might be difficult, or that his utterance might be easy for a foreigner to understand, and that he could say it in other words. As a result, the person not only remains misunderstood but becomes confused about being considered deaf.
