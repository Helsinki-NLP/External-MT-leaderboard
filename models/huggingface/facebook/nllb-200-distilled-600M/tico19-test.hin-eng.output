Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing a similar trend in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic, occurring at different stages depending on the country, is increasing rapidly in all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases with unknown diagnostic-scientific status was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, China reported novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as pathogenic.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% cases have an observation of a critical disease requiring serious care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, COVID-19 further spread geographically and the current COVID-19 pandemic activity in the rest of the world has surpassed this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of EuroSurveillance 2020 reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as per WHO case definition in Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date.
Achieving cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, National and Regional Health Authority and WHO, and the Worldwide COVID-19 Cases Report are updated daily at 8:00 am.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and compare them with the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the active spread of COVID-19 cases, we calculated the summary cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases of 14 days in each EU/EEA country and UK taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as of 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 as compared to Italy in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and UK
The trend of a 14-day summary cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the whole UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and increased rapidly around 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but the same increasing trend was seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to Italy in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
It specifically indicates that as of 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to those in Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that there are different stages of national public health responses and possibly different case definitions and different protocols for choosing patients in countries, which must be checked for COVID-19 confirmation including capture and screening.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
The data on hospitalization and/or intensive care unit admission of COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a sequential manner to complement the current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
The 2010-11 study showed a large gap in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe from 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (with 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Spread of hospitalized COVID-19 cases with 90% of the risk related to intensive care bed capacity with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK simulation of health care capacity saturation related conditions is provided in the sixth update of ECDC's acute risk assessment on COVID-19.
As cases have so far remained in clusters in some areas of the EU/EEA countries and the UK and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve the defined regional public, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for the continuous community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment, with the shift from limiting to mitigating approaches, a faster, pre-active and comprehensive approach is needed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as if not implemented in time, the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The acute risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have very few opportunities to further increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on healthcare to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is highly likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a rapid increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a serious disaster for humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted from bats and generates similar symptoms by similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects men more than older people and women than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will include the basics of epidemiology, forensics, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of disease.
While there are still many questions to be answered, we hope that this review will help us understand and eradicate the deadly disease.
Due to the novel viral outbreak, Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were requested to stay home for the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the 2003 outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was renamed CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital due to the virus and more than 3,000 patients dying.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is the enemy number 1 of the people and is probably more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on 7 January 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, forensics, diagnosis, and treatment have been published, which has determined the sequence of the virus by isolating multiple patients.
This review seeks to present the essence of research progress on new and fast developing subject areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with other diseases caused by SARS and CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS outbreak in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far in relation to disease prevention and prediction as well as some other still essential questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens to humans, with a prevalence of around 15% of common cold 4.
However, in this century we have faced two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to several other countries with terrible illness and mortality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third COVID outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a herd of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, was first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Sequence of CoV was released seven days later.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infection was reported in healthcare providers, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan City was closed with all its public transport shut down.
The first clinical study on the disease on 24 January reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is rapidly escalating, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
A more up-to-date presentation of the pandemic was presented in a multi-central study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11 February 2020 (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mainly between the ages of 30-65.
About half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons were under 10 years of age.
Men (0.31/100,000) were more infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 mainly spread to herds in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to extensive traffic before Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and isolated viruses with single RNA-strength.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The S-contact is bound to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and then fuses into the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cell membrane; after replication of the viral genome, the membrane forms genomic RNA - viricidal bundles with glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins, which are then fused into the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of beta-CoV in which over 99.98% genetic similarity was found in 10 indexed samples collected from the Hunan Seafood Market, Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By electron transmission microscope, SARS -CoV-2 particles were found in ultra - thin sections of human airway satellite.
ACE2 was found to be receptive for human SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 with greater weakness than SARS-CoV which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
Novel small protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2, orf3b and secreted protein encoded by orf8 can also be produced.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in mixing with amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which contained free and closed compounds, was synthesized as dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could bind two S proteins which provide evidence for identification and transmission of CoV.
B0AT1, may be a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
and primary intermediate nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by cats and camels respectively.
By caste comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs, bats were considered the original nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient helped to cross the virus species barrier and infect humans is unknown and the route of transmission is yet to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans involving similar recombination with S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolin - the long-throated, ant-eating mammal SARS-CoV-2 often used in traditional Chinese medicine - is a potential intermediate nutrient for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity in the CoV found in pangolin.
However, the spread of the 1% difference across both genomes is still large; therefore, decisive results are awaited for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours and less than 20 °C and up to 5 days in artificial ambient dry environments at 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, at 56 °C, is sensitive to ultraviolet rays for 30 minutes; ethers, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but chlorhexidine cannot.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to novel viruses.
There are currently no detailed studies reported regarding immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Typically, after the virus has entered the nutrient, it is first identified by the nutrient's innate immune system from the model identification receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
By pathways, the virus induces the expression of various inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, the adapted immune response becomes involved in fighting the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific immunities and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T - support cells produce pro - inflammatory cytokine to aid the protective cells.
However, CoV can interfere with T cell function by killing T cells.
Triadodon resistance including supplements and immunizations such as C3a and C5a is also necessary to fight viral infection.
For example, immunosuppressed patients who recovered disabled MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system produces a huge number of locally free particles that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and even multiorgan failure and death in the worst cases.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by the onset in the herd is more likely to affect elderly people and pregnant women with the infection.
It is common for people who come into contact with a higher number of viruses or have a combined immune function to be more likely to become infected than others.
Based on the first 425 case studies in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, in a study of 1,099 cases, incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on demographic of 8,866 cases found that incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected but symptomless people to others is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus usually require a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal secretions, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced breathing difficulties and/ or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients experienced a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and pulmonary imaging abnormalities should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis even in cases of acute fever.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98 for fever, 76 for dry cough, 55% for breathing difficulties and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of herds generated by transmission from family herds and symptomatically untreated individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) were also the main symptoms in MERS-CoV patients.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them had to resort to ventilation and this corresponds to a higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat lumps (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), breathing difficulties (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and throat cramps (13-25%) were observed in SARS patients as major symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation.
The COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% as of February 14, when the confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
In comparison, the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases based on a June 2012 demographic study.
Earlier study reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 was 6.47 higher with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while SARS-CoV's R0 was only between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is presented in Table Table 1.1.
The above data indicate that the spread potential of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than both of the latter.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of a herd is usually the same family or the same crowd or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within the last two weeks from the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms and recovered patients discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, warning of prolonged quarantine time.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients at the initial stage is normal or low.
For example, lymphophenia and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and immunity were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with white blood cell counts including 1×109/L and 1×109/L.
In some patients, the levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood increased and in most patients, the C - reactive protein and erythrocytes degradation in the blood increased.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D - dimers, a product of fibrin decay present in the blood, was elevated and the number of vaccine cells continued to decrease steadily.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are indicated by bilateral spotted images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis.
The side effects of type I and type II pneumosites reduce the surface activation levels and increase surface tension and thus reduce the ability of the lungs to swell and increase the risk of the lungs to stop working.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often parallel the most severe condition of the disease.
The first pathological analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 observed the dislocations of pneumosites in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, the formation of a helin membrane and the perforated leakage of vaccine cells, and multicellular polycentric cells that were consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the key parameter for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis in China on 13 February 2020 (which was no longer dependent on RT-PCR alone).
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre per input) using depsticks, without the need for any detailed equipment.
If validated in clinical samples, the hope is that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to lack of experience with novel CoV, physicians can provide mainly supportive care to COVID-19 patients with various therapies previously used or proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological assistance.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a race to develop immunizations and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks mainly the lungs and possibly to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory paralysis and failure remain a major threat to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for symptom relief and life saving and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-intrusive ventilation and intrusive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), modified cardiopulmonary subway technique used in the treatment of life - lethal heart or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting function of critical organs is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytocaine storm is a type of systemic inducing reaction characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These stimulate immune cells to release a large number of cytokine - free molecules that are major causes of ARDS and poly organ failure.
Immunotherapy is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal immunizants, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include changes in T cell- directed immune response; inhibiting IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibiting JAK; inhibiting Blinatumab; suppressing cytokine signaling 4; and inhibiting HDAC.
The steroid as an immunosuppressive was widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of the pathogenic damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, dramatically affecting the diagnosis, especially nonvascular osteoarthritis.
Nevertheless, short-term corticosteroid procedures at low to moderate doses are recommended for use with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
As of the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue administered intravenously has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed potential inhibitors of other monounsaturated RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made the compound available to China to conduct two trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly expected.
Also, baricitinib, interferon-α, iopinvir/ ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Co-treatment with iopinavir/ritonavir may lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
Interaction with other medicines used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma and immunity production from recovered patients
There has been a long history of blood collection from patients cured of an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from suffering from the disease.
In fact, the blood of healed patients has a relatively high level of immunity to pathogens.
The immunoids produced by B - vaccine cells to fight pathogens and other exogenous substances are immunoglobulins (Ig) and they identify and directly deactivate unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
With low swelling and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood, their symptoms improved within 24 hours.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and explanation are necessary to propose the methodology for large scale use.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, some plasma related harm should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-excit the immune response and cause cytokine-release syndrome, which is potentially life - lethal toxicity.
The concentration of immunes in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma for treating critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific immunity so quickly to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes for effective immunity or to test effective immunity to the necessary proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of immunes.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in different formulations based on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective components are still unknown or meaningless as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Do capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%) saw the highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 in several provinces of China, while Hubei province where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is quite rough as many other impact factors such as number of patients and severity should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Bodi Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare only Western Medicine (WM) treatment and combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for body temperature to become normal, for symptoms to be seen and for hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressive, the symptomatic deterioration rate (lightly to severe) of the WM+TCM group was significantly lower (7.4% vs. 46.2%) than the WM group alone and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%) than the WM group alone.
Nevertheless, more sound testing at larger scale and more centres is still pending for the effectiveness and safety of TCM.
It will also be interesting to identify the system of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience a great deal of fear of highly contagious and fatal disease and quarantined people also experience nausea, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, deoxygenation and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause increased discomfort and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological diseases including persistent stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychoactive arousal, mental symptoms, mourning, even suicide were reported.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, finding mandatory contact and quarantine can make people more restless and aware of the effects of contact, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and persons in contact with them as well as the general public.
Psychological support should include establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates on outbreaks and treatment plans of SARS-CoV-2 and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to disrupt the transmission link from the parasitic cells and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often complementary to antiviral treatments in the control of epidemics due to increasing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful inactivating immune and/or defensive immunity to SARS-CoV.
Live-threaded vaccines have been evaluated in biosimilar samples of SARS.
However, the efficacy of these Vivo vaccines in elderly people and lethal challenging models and their safety against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before any clinical study can begin.
This is probably because SARS gradually ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, the presence of zoonotic sources in epidemic areas has led to sparse cases and swarms of MERS emerging in the Middle East and spreading to other regions.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using passive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and subunits of recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is essential and critical to controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the long-term need for vaccine development (average 18 months) and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire diagnostic process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high incidence and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for healthcare agencies to create a diagnostic model to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred in the age group of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of patients were over 50 years of age, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have inherent congenital disorders and complications and were significantly older than those who did not have such a need (51 vs. median age of 66), indicating age as a predictive factor of outcome for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More males than females have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as reported above.
Congenital and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and atherosclerosis.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, ACE2-positive colangiosites may also bind to the liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are deeply interrelated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been proposed as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment and eventual recovery.
CRP level correlation with COVID-19 severity and diagnosis has also been proposed.
Also, increased lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) may also help in estimating the result.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and the timely progression of clinical symptoms with other problems should be considered for predicting the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroid providers are immunosuppressants commonly used as a combination therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in low doses and for short term in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extreme stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological advice and long term support is essential to help these people recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 has epidemiological characteristics different from SARS.
As well as replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause mild or any symptoms in the early stages of infection like other cold-causing CoVs.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities in the early stages or incubation period with great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was believed to have occurred when patients were very ill, while most transmission did not occur during the initial stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
There are currently major efforts underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, which points to a downturn in the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the downward phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., predicted that COVID-19 which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set up the model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 patients who recovered and were hospitalized 2 weeks ago have been identified in both the mid-turbinate and throat faces indicating that the newly identified virus, influenza, may become a recurrent case.
However, there are promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
Initially, half a million deaths from Ebola were predicted to be one million cases.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will become weakened in infectiousness and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with contaminated material from the virus.
The virus was also found in the stool, which also creates a new possibility of oral transmission from the stool.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing diseases and 40 healthcare providers, were likely due to clinical infections.
Therefore, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, coworkers and patients should also take great care to protect those who stand next to them or those who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series # 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from potentially infected persons from getting into the air or sticking to the surface of things, from where they can pass to others.
However, with only 5% of the viruses being fully crossed, only N95 (Series # 1860s) masks can prevent 10 to 80 nm of small viruses from entering the respiratory tract; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also pass through five surgical masks placed on top of one, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should necessarily wear N95 (Series # 1860s) masks, rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person with the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing N95 masks; the virus may have entered the body through his projective eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face covering or glasses when working with patients.
Or the general public in potentially affected areas is strongly advised to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant soap, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Three feet is considered reasonable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, due to its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV, it must have given China extreme caution based on a deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the Director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that novel virus has low human-to-human transmission and limited reproductive capacity and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message liberated the public from fear, especially as the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival and the time came to limit the disease to a minimum in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when making public announcements as every word matters to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from practitioners or officials; (3) be more restrictive in limiting a potential pandemic in the early stages rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) release frequently targeted and effective practices to raise public awareness of the pandemic and periodically examine and improve the community response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has made SARS more frequent.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than older people and women than young people, and the severity and mortality rate among the elderly is also higher than among the young.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless whereas SARS patients often do so when they are seriously ill, which creates much greater difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and with greater prevalence than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who recovered may be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases remain unresolved, which are:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats-like SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Original nutrient, suppose what species was the intermediate in the transmission of the virus from bats to humans?
Without finding the answer to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop transmission and the outbreak could ever recur.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and then cause pathological changes?
Does the virus bind ACE2 - individual cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it end slowly like SARS or will it continue to recur periodically like flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find the answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic and restore our lives to normalcy.
Animal origin of human coronaviruses
Coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) have evolved alongside each other over a period of thousands of years due to mutations and adaptations.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness like colds.
The outbreaks of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back to light and has shocked us with its greater contagiousness but decreased pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will help us.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs also have information about intermediate cell nutrients.
The identification of animal nutrients has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Examining interactions of the CoV-nutrient in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenicity of the CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current information about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of discovery as well as zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the perspective of progressive evolution of viruses and gene recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need to successfully change nutrients and the implications of the progressive development of the virus on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of coronaviruses which includes groups of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which harbor the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses, were named CoVs because of their crown - shaped physiology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unsequited genomes that are structurally similar.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overabundant reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyproteins.
The polyprotein is further processed to generate 16 non - structural proteins named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many genealogically-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by different genealogies of CoVs.
Based on variation in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four generations (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV), of which the Beta-CoV generation is mostly HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Casteographic evidence has shown that bats and mosquitoes are the gene sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major clusters of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously overcome species barriers and emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperpulmonary manifestations with a higher likelihood.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal efflux of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been collected through detailed studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until before the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that HCoVs infection is generally harmless.
With an untreated case fatality rate of around 10%, the SARS outbreak in 2003 infecting over 8000 people is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak created a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with a sparse spread elsewhere in the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 infections as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are of animal origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Many evidence support the gradual evolution of all HCoVs from bats, in which viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show highly genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented tremendous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Detecting the zoological source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and binding factors of species breeding.
It can guide or facilitate the search for host, intermediate and enhancing animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2 with significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origin, intergenic transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the HCoVs' ancestral viruses are nonpathogenic in their natural cell nutrients but become pathogenic after intrastate transmission into new nutrients.
We will also review the trend of progressive evolution of HCoV in which infectiousness increases with decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E breed was isolated from the nasal drainage of infected common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from several infected animals including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the last decades.
A brief summary of the chronology of the discovery of HCoV (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which later adapted to grow in the cellular lines of the WI-38 lungs.
In 10~20% of cases, patients infected with HCoV-229E experienced symptoms of cold, including headache, sneezing, discomfort and throat aches, with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated in the brains of milky rats by a gradual route and by organ amplification.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to infections caused by HCoV-229E which are symbolically unbiased from infections with other respiratory pathways pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally spread and are likely to be mainly transmitted during the winter with warmer weather.
Usually, the progressive development of both viruses is less than a week, followed by an illness of about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, mild colds developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as Atypical pneumonia, was the first well documented HCoV pandemic in human history and the cause of it, the third HCoV discovered, is SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be identified in Guangdong province of China in late 2002.
With the spread of SARS epidemic across multiple countries and continents, there were 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the most prevalent, it was estimated that with a progressive growth period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral exposure on the 10th day of the disease, there could be an increase of about two secondary cases due to each case.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle aches, headaches, fever, discomfort and cold, followed by breathing difficulties, cough and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function testing and increased creatinine kinase are common abnormalities associated with the laboratory of SARS.
Transmitted air cell damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increase in macrophage are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require further intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, usually with cytokine storm, can also become infected in these severe cases, which can be particularly fatal for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the relative of the indicator patient by an open biopsy of the lungs that had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been made in research into HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to spread to young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Cold - wounds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV - NL63.
In another independent study, the same virus was described as being isolated from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63 and its peak occur during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to the inhibitory autoimmune disease, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old elderly man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was also reported to be related to severe asthma outbreaks.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide to cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four community-based HCoVs have been well adapted in humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs have gained the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves in humans, they become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Where most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread among close relatives have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS characterized by progressive severe pneumonia are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute kidney failure, which has so far been seen only in MERS in HCoV-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, swarms of pneumonia patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared an international public health emergency of international concern for the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections due to SARS-CoV-2 and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with an untreated case mortality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the death rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which can appear as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can increase rapidly as an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they fall into different branches of caste lineage.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptomless patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and observation of the disparity of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs has shown very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the course of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the normal trend of six other HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, infection with SARS-CoV-2 shows characteristics that are commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also observes characteristic variants of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectiousness of HCoVs acquired from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after progression in humans as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether SARS-CoV-2's malarial-mouth transmission plays a significant role in at least some conditions like SARS-CoV remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 can behave seasonal like cases of HCoVs acquired from the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including infectiousness, pathogenicity and persistent spread after human transmission will be influential on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs acquired from all four communities, which produce mild symptoms, have been well adapted in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both ancient HCoVs may have survived epidemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and those that develop serious HCoV diseases in humans have been eliminated.
To do this, the accumulation of adapted mutations that inhibit nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCoVs in humans to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects the more people, the more likely it is to be fully adapted in humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been transmitted to the human population, causing colds in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not need animal cells.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to remain and spread in their zoological cage and possibly find a chance to be propagated to human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least at present it is very contagious like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and transmitted to humans without any cell or intermediate animal feed.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the progressive evolution of HCoVs, natural, cellular, intermediate and enhancing nutrients.
An animal is a progressive HCoV nutrient if it provides shelter to a very close ancestor with high similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The pathogenic virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this nutrient.
Similarly, the cell-nutrient HCoVs provide sustained and long-term shelter.
In both cases, nutrients become naturally infected and are natural nutrients of HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient just before or around entry into humans, it does not adapt well to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and can play the role of a nutrient that increases the transmission of the virus to humans by temporarily replicating the virus and then increasing the level of human infection.
An HCoV can go into an end-infection if it cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate nutrient.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate nutrients and maintain locality for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural cell nutrient.
Epidemiological data showed that the indicative case of SARS had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence tests indicated that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-like IgG was higher among animal traders than among the general public.
In live animal markets, masked palm squirrels (Paguama larvae) and rakun dogs were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all seawats of the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that most masked palm seeds of wild or farmland, not in contact with live animal markets, were SARS-CoV negative, indicating that masked pal seeds can only be severe as a medium-growing nutrient and not as a natural host of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV immunity in different animals, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also be intermediate enhancing nutrients of SARS-CoV cannot be denied.
These all seem to be the last nutrients of SARS-CoV.
Follow-up research of the natural animal nutrient of SARS-CoV revealed a very close bat CoV called SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), a SARS-related Rhinofuss bat found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV immunity and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the nutrients of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARSs such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none have been isolated as living viruses except for WIV1.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the host of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from bat feces samples was demonstrated to be used as a grain for cell penetration in bats, seeds and human ACE2.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS patients recovering was able to deactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the over-similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest cell-nutrient to SARS-CoV.
Casteographic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bats use the same nutrient graft, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for entry of the CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus.
RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are closely related to bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not be the closest cell nutrient to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels with a feathered camel, like camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries, are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific inactivating immunities.
MERS-CoV, a living virus similar to the one found in humans, was isolated from the nostrils of the camel with a clawed nose, indicating that camels are authentic cell-feeding hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV have seen the release of a virus that is usually mild but very high.
Remarkably, infected camels remove viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal - oral tract which is also the main route of removal of the virus from bats.
However, questions still arise as there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms of many confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or some unknown transmission pathway involving animal species that shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity with the CoV RaTG13 bat, isolated from bats associated with Rhinofus species.
As with cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to determine a paternal relationship.
That is, bats cannot be the closest cell nutrient to SARS-CoV-2 unless approximately the same bat CoVs are found in the future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal nutrient for SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale seafood market that were associated with several early cases of COVID-19, indicating human transmission from potential animals.
Several recent studies based on the matasinomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolin (man's javanika) may also provide shelter for SARS-CoV-2 related pathogenic beta-CoVs.
These new pangolin CoV genome share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are as closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are in two sub-genealogies of SARS-CoV-2 homologous viruses in the caste lineage with one sharing a more similar graph binding region (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are highly diverse despite the gene-wide more sequence similarity.
An earlier study of the diseased pangolin also reported finding a group of viral oversized DNA from lung samples similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted several different combined methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence with a viral genome full length of 86.3%.
We cannot deny the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
The pathway for progressive development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
Where the highest sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the highest genome-wide sequence similarity is found in SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
It is a very speculative idea that the over-similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs and RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively intermediate convergence progression.
An alternative proposal is in favour of recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wildlife species.
As the driving force of progressive evolution, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoogenous origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Casteographic evidence indicated that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the pathogenic viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mosquitoes.
It has been reported that the bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Applachen Ridge CoV) found in three-colored bats from North America has been closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 CoV, which was found in Ghana, although camellid is also a suspected intermediate nutrient.
For clarity, the current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Caste analysis has provided evidence of intergenic transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was observed.
The history of intergenic transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs have been found to be quite close to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpha -CoV.
Many evidence supports transmission of the virus directly to humans from bats.
First, the common ecological habitat of alpacas has been exposed to bats, not humans.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas derive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be denied.
In fact, bat rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses.
It is therefore not more surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bats are gene pools of alpha-CoVs HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels with feces may be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of intrastate transmission from bats to ruminant camels and from ruminant camels to humans.
The progressive evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known for its primary identification and has been further reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich spectrum of virus species for intergenic exchange and intergenic transmission of genetic fragments.
Longevity, dense settlements, close social interaction and high flight ability all favourable conditions for bats to be ideal virus transmitters.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the nesting camels for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels which have converted from intermediate nutrients to stable and natural crop nutrients.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It is a transient transmission accident in humans and humans remain the last nutrient of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolin in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is, if any, different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in pangolin.
They may be the final nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs like seawater in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of intrastate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be accepted or refuted in future studies.
First, bats can be cell-nutrient for SARS-CoV-2 related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological habitat with bats by killing or mining coal.
Secondly, pangolin may be one of the intermediate enhancing nutrients in which SARS-CoV-2 related virus had recently entered.
Humans are infected by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including pets may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of immunity in domestic and wild animals are required.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may have been recombined and adapted to a third species that is exposed to both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being explored.
In addition to various animal nutrients, three major factors in relation to viral are also important in smoothly overcoming the species barriers of CoV.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-fiber RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV can be considered to be    high with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site of 2 , depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in new nutrients.
CoVs contain proof-reading exoribonucleases, the deletion of which may lead to excessive variability and degradation or decreased viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is thought to suppress the replication of CoV by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerization.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of CoVs is a million times higher than their nutrients.
Also, the mutation rate is often higher when the CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, indicating a high level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps it has already adapted to another nutrient close to humans.
Along with SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV which has become well adapted in ruminant camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that the genetic flow will rapidly deactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA in CoV puts additional plasticity on the genome mutation for genome mutation and recombination, increasing the likelihood of intragenic co-sequential development, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by a rich unique open reading frame and protein functions coded at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs change patterns repeatedly during RNA replication by randomly following the unique copy-choice method.
In nutrients that act as a mixture agent, the fibrous change usually occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Very similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs, can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
Natural caste genetic evidence of recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral - nutrient interactions with respect to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with nutrient host is another important factor affecting intragenital transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during intergenic transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of the determinants between human and sewed SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is considered to be rapidly adapting to various nutrients, with mutations on RBD of S protein in particular.
Typically, RBD in an S protein of a CoV interacts with cellular grafting and is selected by a nutrient immune response with intensity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment that binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE2 receptors in various animals including bats, seawats, rats and raccoon dogs, which leads to intergenic transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed in RBD as distinct from human and seawater viral isolates and 4 of them are actually located in the graph - bound baseline for interaction with ACE2 graphite.
The RBD of seawater SARS-CoV contains mutations K479N and S487T which may increase the attraction of spike protein interactions with human ACE2 graphite.
In other words, these two amino acid replacements can be critical in adapting viral in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular graft with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the binding similarity of its S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, the Cryo-EM study indicates 10 to 20 times more attraction of this addition than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-customer will be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Several other HCoV graphite are present, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silica acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after interspecies transmission from their animal nutrients.
The resulting intragenic transmission of HCoVs is controlled by other nutrient dependencies and restriction factors besides cellular grafting.
Difference of these nutrient proteins between humans and natural HCoVs, such as bats, raccoon camels and mosquitoes, can hinder intragenic transmission.
Nutritional dependence factors must be adhered to and nutrient restriction factors reversed for successful intragenic transmission of HCoVs.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of viral-nutritive interaction have yet to be identified and described.
Non-biased genome-wide testing of nutrient dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology can be fruitful.
Rise of novel HCoVs: Back to basics
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as the gene cluster of CoVs, HCoVs.
Also, rapid mutation and genetic reintegration also lead to the development of HCoV and serve two important steps in the process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the potential to greatly alter viral symptoms of acquisition or loss.
Among SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 has been considered critical in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but were found to encode diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide extinction of SARS-CoVs has been characterized in breeds isolated at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes cell mutation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs lineages, with a very large number of small recombination regions identified in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the MERS-CoV pandemic experienced relapsing events among different strains, which occurred in camels with feces in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can cause unintended changes in viral genomes, possibly due to election-pressure-free viruses, such as by the immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide extinction.
While the unbroken ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, Alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, resulting in frameshift.
Last but not least, the gradual development of novel HCoVs also results from election pressure in their cell nutrients.
Symptoms were not identified or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs indicating a correlation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats have become structurally and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in activating pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce pathogenicity caused by CoVs.
In addition, the inhibitory natural lethal cell activity in bats is suppressed by the regulation of the natural lethal cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low expression level of major tissue conformation complex category I molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the more metabolic activity of bats can suppress the replication of CoV and affect proof reading by exoribonucleases, thus providing selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds upon entry into new nutrients.
Reproduction can also develop more pathogenic CoV breeds, resulting in new proteins or protein characteristics for nutritional adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic in cell nutrients such as bats and camels or cause mild symptoms.
They strongly replicate without showing a strong nutrient - resistant response.
This is the secret of why symptomless carriers are seen and what causes serious cases in human infection.
Symptoms are mainly caused by a severe immune response and an overactivation of the cytokine storm, with the more an immune response, the more severe lung damage.
In contrast, in symptomless carriers, the immune response has been differentiated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of isolating the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 medicine.
Interferon reaction is particularly acute in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, NLRP3 inflamesome activation in bats is defective.
With this argument, blocking NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general theme that gave rise to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where the bat beta-CoV has been observed to have 95% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV, the bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
While seawater and other animals have been seen in the markets to shelter viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the closest intermediate nutrients to SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found with SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or may contribute to gene fragments in the final variant of SARS-CoV-2 of pangolin beta-CoVs.
While questions remained, there has been no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately created or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have been discussed due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has changed our understanding of the animal cells of HCoVs in the zoonotic origin and standard transmission.
The extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are primarily bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate nutrients.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and seawater in markets, closing wet markets and killing seawater there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, due to the discovery of several strains of pangolin beta-CoVs very close to SARS-CoV-2, pangolin should be removed from the weight market to prevent animal transmission.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolin and other mammals and how is yet to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the nesting camels for decades.
These camels are an important means of transportation for the locals as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to give up all camels to control MERS as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A broad approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene variants may emerge to cause outbreaks.
Diverse zoonotic CoVs are roaming in wildlife.
Specifically, bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
It is quite likely that these zoonotic CoVs will be genetically developed and recombined, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more contagious and/or fatal in humans in the future.
In some areas of China, the culture of eating wild animals must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the tough test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response planning should be done.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural cage until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that help spread viruses, if people are educated about staying away from bats, the chances of humans contacting them and other wild species can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients which will prove useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is to keep humans away from the ecological habitats of the natural cells of zoonotic viruses.
Several parts of the puzzle of the zoogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Secondly, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate nutrient, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be carried out.
Whether it is bats, pangolins or any other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural nutrients in the future.
Continuous investigation in this area will clarify the progressive pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant impacts in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the clinical criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Rapid Consultation Guidelines, and this guideline provides our experience and appropriate context for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually growing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest clinical criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named as Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed expedited consultation guidelines and which has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually growing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
For example, a total of seven versions have been released with fundamental changes in some contexts in the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (NHC) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020.
Now that our guidelines have been commented on by Zhou et al., they have proposed a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guidelines and has also provided valuable references to this pandemic around the world.
We support and express our gratitude for their important work.
However, their work needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh test version) and recent studies for COVID-19.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), to conduct a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case, any one item of epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three items of clinical manifestations need to be completed:
History of pandemic: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) History of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) History of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (4) History of contact with a group of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, classroom, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells reflecting normal, decreased or low lymphocytes in the early stages.
The case being diagnosed must be based on a suspected case containing one item of pathogenic or serial evidence that is: (1) a real-time PCR test comes to be positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing shows high homology to known novel coronavirus; (3) a serum test comes to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM immunity and IgG immunity; or a SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG immunity changes from negative to positive, or a confirmation score increases ≥ 4 times in the health benefit phase compared to the acute confirmation phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
Pathogenic identification of blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serial evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These revisions were based on the ongoing work of researchers who are exploring respiratory system samples including an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as blood samples, increasing the availability of various samples, and supporting the conversion of specific immuno-positive results to confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, there is a great deal of evidence that reminds us to be cautious with patients with unusual symptoms and symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they have classified a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that you find and follow the latest guidelines for your home countries.
Our team will also update its guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh has five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest single-day figure ever
Yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.

Stores in Australia have reduced the number of toilet paper items that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper items that can be purchased at a time in all their stores nationally to two and one packages respectively.
ALDI also imposed the one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on checkout sites and on Facebook pages of the series.
It is reported that the shoppers were making collective purchases in a situation where they needed to keep themselves isolated due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase limit for toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packets at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in its March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban, stock is still running out in many stores within an hour of delivery, and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI said in a Facebook post on Tuesday it was "unexpected".
According to a spokesman for Woolworths, sales surged sharply last week.
Costco 's Canberra - based store also limited the volume to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages to suppliers and also increased frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI raised stock to make the pre-planned Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that try to increase retail stock, but it becomes difficult to do so due to restrictions imposed by the local council on timed truck delivery.
In a situation where suppliers are trying to meet demand and the number of specials has decreased, Russell is expected to increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock is released ahead of schedule, some stores will not be able to operate Wednesday specials.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores fill up stocks every night.
He said that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it cannot have a large stock, and then, when all the stock is sold, the large shelves behind are left empty, making the shortage felt and hardened.
Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News, said that Coles and Woolworths had the idea [that] if there were enough stuff on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizers could be bought and in large quantities, the mess could probably be reduced.
Who Gives a Crap, manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday that it was out of stock.
According to News.com.au, the cleaners' toilet tissue manufacturer, Kimberly - Clark, and the sorbent manufacturer, Solaris Paper, insisted that they were working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that in Melbourne, where fewer auctions are being held than before due to buyers celebrating the long Labor Day weekend, some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to first bidders in the auction.
The Thursday edition of a daily, NT News, published in Darwin, had an eight-page insert that was cut and given for use as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, the stores were initially unwilling to ban; in this report they had said that they had no plans to ban shopping.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, hand washes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the two-pack limit of 12 rolls was also imposed on purchases of Andres toilet paper at the online British supermarket Okado on Sunday evening.
World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS CoV-2 as a global pandemic.
Although the term "global pandemic" means only how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to act.
All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic.
If the country detects disease, treats patients, isolates them, tracks them down and unites them in response, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adnanom Gebraiesis.
We are extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of prevalence and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this is an unprecedented global pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he said that no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been detected from sustained global spread.
Gebraiesis also expressed some similar thoughts when he said, "We have not seen a global pandemic caused by a coronavirus to date".
He added, "And we have not seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.
This new global epidemic designation follows the WHO decision to declare an international public health emergency of concern to the outbreak in January.
Dr. Anthony Fochi, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "One hundred things, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide and more than 4,600 deaths as a result, the Associated Press reported.
201920 Coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Its outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be as long as two to fourteen days.
It has no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The recommended preventive measures include: hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others and monitoring and self - isolation for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility bans.
The pandemic has created serious global socio-economic unrest, prompted the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and led to widespread supply shortages due to panicked shopping by people.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed nationwide or locally, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and colour, and others from areas with more virus cases.
Low travel and heavy industry shutdowns have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan (capital of Hubei Province) of China reported collective cases of pneumonia from unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is considered to be of an animal origin.
The outbreak spreading virus known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first known person with symptoms was later found to be ill on 1 December 2019, and that person had no apparent association with a group of meat marketers afterwards.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019 were market related.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post reported that a case was a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that with the decline in new cases in China, Italy, Iran and South Korea have seen a sudden increase, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Very few cases may have been reported, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported in young people, of whom 19 years and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, Patrick Wallens, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before achieving effective group immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and according to official protocols whose test has been confirmed positive.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not recover, the time from development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused the deaths of around 97,000 people.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the deaths found positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 can be very high, as it cannot include people dying without testing like at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial statistics from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID deaths.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the alleged death toll] has been underestimated", a statement supported by low-count descriptive reports in the U.S. Such underestimates are likely to occur in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and regions on every continent except Antarctica had reported deaths.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health. The death-case ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated death-case ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that began on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that began after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed to die from a disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people infected to die from a disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not timely and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Many academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for a pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range corresponds to the results of a statistical study analysing the impact of the test on the first randomized COVID-19 test and CFR estimates in Germany.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of outbreaks is uncertain and may vary by location.
"When left uncontrolled, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and begin to decrease when no nutrients are available for disease", said Mackie Bonney of Penn State University.
But it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when it will happen".
Zhong Nanshang, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries follow WHO advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucherski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "is likely to remain circulating for one or two years".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly: 18 months or more)".
"I think it's unlikely that the coronavirus will be completely eradicated", said William Scheffner of Vanderbilt University, "because it's so easily transmitted" and it could "turn into a seasonal disease that comes back every year".
The intensity of the return will depend on the extent of the group immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be non-instantaneous.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory blockage (caff), reduced sense of smell, bloating, muscle and joint pain, nausea, headache, cold, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea or diarrhea. According to WHO, about one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden dizziness, difficulty waking up, and bleeding of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended when these symptoms appear.
Some of the infected people may be non-immediate with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm infection, so researchers have advised that people in close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to avoid infection.
The Chinese estimate of the non-immediate ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly by small droplets produced during close contact and during coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that a cough without a mask can cause drops of 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by tiny droplets generated during speech that stay in the air for longer. Breathing droplets can also be generated during exhalation, including while talking, although the virus is not usually airborne.
The droplets can pass into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly through the lungs by breathing.
Some medical procedures such as duct penetration and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) may cause respiratory secretion to be extinguished and thus airborne spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before and during the later stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of confirmed ultrasound cases have been reported in the laboratory, but ultrasound transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection checks.
According to the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person typically infects two to three other individuals.
In particular, the virus was found detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, one day on cardboard, and four hours on copper.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature. Tests for COVID-19 have been positive in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that the virus can pass from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing your hands after being exposed to animals, as is done after being exposed to other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with severe pneumonia associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from domestic soap, which disintegrates its protective lining. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the group of GAN Betacoronaviruses, subgenus Sarbacovirus (genealogy B) with two bat-derived breeds.
This is 96% the same as other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between pangolin viruses and viruses from humans in parts of the genome sequences.
Compared to the entire genome so far, the common genetic content between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be up to 92% which is insufficient to provide the pangolin intermediate nutrients.
Infection by the virus can be detected temporarily on the basis of symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of infected discharge.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specific with its many image features similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CTs should not be used as a primary test for testing or diagnosing COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which has been released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
The test is usually performed on nasagrasani fascia, but a throat fascia can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect immunity.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Symptomatic image characteristics on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass blurring and absent pulmonary secretion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to similarities with other infections such as Adenovirus, without confirmation by PCR, imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although the imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent the spread of disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and placing that tissue directly in a garbage can.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Measures to maintain physical distance are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a state of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they became infected. Care providers caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, contact precautions and protect the eyes. Contact tracking is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log in proximity to a user's other cell phones.
Users receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about methods of infection prevention are spreading; for example, rubbing the nose and grinding with a mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty; before eating; and after spraying, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
In addition, the CDC has recommended using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropenol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine (within one minute of exposure to a disinfectant to a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalconum chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons etc. should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people turn their mouth and nose with their elbows or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing masks can limit the amount of breathing droplets spread over talking, sneezing and coughing and the distance to be tracked.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene". Masks are also recommended for use by those who are caring for someone with the disease.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have started to encourage the use of face masks by ordinary people.
In the US, the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of fabric. China has especially recommended the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come into close contact with others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out to public places without wearing a mask or nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear face masks when going to public areas for their own and others' protection.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all persons entering grocery stores to wear face masks.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when going into public areas.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has made face masks mandatory for passengers on trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made wearing face masks mandatory when going out, while it has also recommended making homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control work aimed at slowing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls.
People can apply methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in the affected areas.
The maximum mass recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in any region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public crowds of more than two people. Older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems are at higher risk of serious diseases and complications and are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with a community outbreak. In late March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the purpose of social contact is to reduce physical contact, either virtual or remote.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the implication that, rather than encouraging people to stay in contact with others through alternative means, they should adopt complete social distancing. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex only with someone living with you who has no symptoms of the virus or virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued for high risk groups.
Individuals who may have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and who have recently visited a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of final potential risk.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to detect infected people as well as implement other measures to control infection and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of disease, efforts go into a containment phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
Both containment and mitigation measures can be combined at the same time.
More extreme measures are needed to suppress the epidemic, to reverse the original reproductive number by reducing it to 1. Part of managing the outbreak of infectious disease is trying to reduce the epidemic peak, known as the reduction of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of over-feeding health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can manage outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-quarantine; community measures intended to create physical distance such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. More stringent action was taken in China to curb outbreaks aimed at containment when the severity of the outbreak became clear, such as quarantining entire cities and strict travel.
Other countries also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has launched a massive investigation and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial assistance to infected people who quarantined themselves and imposed a heavy fine on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished the stockpiling of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the US show that mitigation (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the pandemic) and repression (reversing the development of the pandemic) are major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but even after this hundreds of deaths and health systems are at their peak.
Suppression may be prioritized, but it needs to be maintained until the virus spreads to the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it is first), otherwise transmission from the sluggishness in measures returns quickly.
Long-term intervention in the suppression of the pandemic generates social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral medicines have been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway including testing of existing medicines.
Taking cold - colds medications without a prescription, drinking fluids, and relaxing can help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
Steroid use can lead to worse outcomes.
Many compounds that are already approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and tailoring healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at multiple levels, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capacities through training of personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are many opinions as to where the first case (the so - called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it is of animal origin. A pneumonia group with an unknown cause was spotted on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Xixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of practitioners at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about "SARS-like coronavirus".
The police warned eight doctors, including Lee Wenliang, of spreading false rumors and another doctor, Ai Fan, was reprimanded by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
Numerous cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan, resulting in investigations being launched in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the movement and Wuhan transport hub and major rail exchange due to the Chinese New Year.
On January 20, China recorded about 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms as of 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the US has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, over 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 people have recovered.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantine (known as stay at home orders, in-place shelter orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people in the US or about 90% of the population are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
On 27 December 2019, the initial genetic testing of patient samples indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
After these reports came in, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission had initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a furious campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping called "People's War".
Described as the "biggest quarantine in human history", a siege zone was declared on January 23 to prevent movement in Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was banned.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoschensein Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Lichensen Hospital, was built later to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities such as conference centers and stadiums in Wuhan into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government established additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health announcements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.

The programme introduced by South Korea was considered the largest and best organised programme in the world for testing the population for the virus and isolating any infected people as well as for tracking and quarantining those who contacted them.
The screening methods included mandatory self-notification of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, quick testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for the impeachment of Moon, claiming mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or praised his response.

The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the least responsive of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British Government had not implemented any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for the perceived lack of speed and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control - the leading public health institute of the US government - announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, the US got off to a slow start in testing, making it difficult to understand the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The trial was hampered by defective test kits manufactured by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental test kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria (after which a doctor's order was required) for people to be eligible for a trial by early March.

WHO has praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and contain the pandemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government has "regularly provided updates to avoid fears before the Lunar New Year holidays".
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Gallia commented that while "certainly not recommended by WHO" it was a "very important sign of a commitment to contain the pandemic where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) after confirming human-to-human transmission and the increase in the number of other cases outside China, the sixth PHEIC since measures were first taken during the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adnom said PHEIC was caused by "the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries without strong health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed for a contribution of $675 million to strategic preparation in low-income countries from the global community, citing the need to help countries that "do not have systems installed to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was to emerge".
Tedros further announced in statements that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later". On February 11, WHO established the COVID-19 as the disease's name at a press conference.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed to provide "the power of the entire UN system in response".
As a result, a UN crisis management team was activated, which coordinated the entire UN response, which, according to WHO, would enable them to "focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to cope with the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak".
On February 14, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to visit the region to provide ground reality to international and WHO experts in China, to assist in domestic management and to assess "the severity and contagion of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with major national-level institutions and to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural arrangements". On February 25, WHO announced that it is possible that "the world should make more efforts to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic", saying that although it would be too soon for the pandemic to happen, countries should "be in a phase of preparation", while saying that it is too early.
In response to an ongoing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO authorities said that the global threat of coronavirus would be assessed from "high" to "very high", the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that "this is a reality check for every government on earth: it's time to wake up.
The virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared", urging that the right response measures can help the world avoid "its worst".
Ryan further said that the current statistics have not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially accepting that every human being on Earth will be exposed to the virus".
On 11 March, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned by both the dangerous level of spread and severity and the dangerous level of inactivity". WHO has faced major criticism as inadequate management of the pandemic, including delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.

Several provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political entity's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that the move was intended to protect the Communist Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected a previous acceptance of the coronavirus outbreak starting in Wuhan, which was in favor of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating from the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China's "control system has turned a virus into a global pandemic", which some critics have considered to be misleading by racism and "the failure of their administration to prevent disease".
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government wire, which outlines the communication moratorium with clear origins in the National Security Council, citing as a strategy that "everything is about China".
We are being asked to try to send this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a campaign to increase global influence.
The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned that it has "a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through transformation and a 'liberal politics'".
Borel also said that "China aggressively is pushing the message that unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner".

"Only China reacted bilaterally", said Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity".
On March 22, following a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian Army to send military doctors, special disinfectants and other medical equipment.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper cited an unnamed "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "unnecessary or little used by Italy".
The source accused Russia of "geopolitical and diplomatic" manipulation.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mio have denied and thanked media reports.
Russia sent medical aid to the US from a cargo plane.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering assistance to American allies [Putin] believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production, they will also be able to repay when necessary".
The largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic States, the NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise will be held at a lower level.
Defender 2020 exercise criticised by Secretary General of Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson: "In the current public health crisis, it is not only endangering the lives of US and many European countries' soldiers but also the residents of participating countries where they are working". The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen MPs infected as well as fifteen other current or former politicians.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, asking for help, saying that his country, Iran, is struggling to fight the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against it. The outbreak has prompted calls for the US to adopt social policies equally across other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high level of funding for public health.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect the prospects of Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
Japan's "obscure and passive quarantine efforts" were criticized by South Korea when Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae - in 's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for the impeachment of Moon by the government, claiming mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised his response. The pandemic has prompted countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could help governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule indefinitely, suspending parliament as well as elections and punishing those found to be dealing with the virus and crisis and spreading false information about the government.
The outbreak of the coronavirus has been blamed for many examples of supply shortages, which have resulted from the use of tools to fight outbreaks globally, fear-induced shopping, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and disruption from suppliers.
In many areas, fear-induced shopping was also observed, which led to shortages of groceries such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from shelves, which led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has been warned about delays in transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase in normal prices up to twenty times and a delay in supply of medical supplies for four to six months.
This has led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, which WHO has warned will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Digue shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases and high demand for food products in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, both regions are surviving extreme food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the stockpiling and illicit trade of critical products have been successful, avoiding the extreme food shortages that were predicted in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a significant decline in its agricultural output, but industry representatives say prices may rise.
Empty food shelves were also seen only temporarily in the city of Wuhan, when Chinese government officials released sugar-meat stores to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China has felt a loss to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, government measures to prevent the spread of the virus, and a 20.5% drop in retail sales, had deeply hurt the economy in China in the first two months of 2020.
As mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the outbreak of the virus has been considered a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clear picture emerges on the potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth may be greater than the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis showed an impact of $300+ billion on the global supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly "broke" after the sharp drop in oil prices due to declining demand from China.

Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including travel attractions, and advice from governments to stop any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quant have cancelled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline Flybe has collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was the most observed yet.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The time of the pandemic also coincides with the major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday, Chunyun.
Large numbers of events including annual New Year celebrations were cancelled by national and regional governments, as well as private companies freely closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass celebrations including Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs in Beijing.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to February 10, directing most workplaces not to reopen by that date.
These represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to a high and declared a state of emergency, with schools closed by March and its New Year celebrations canceled. The retail sector has been affected globally, with store hours reduced or temporarily closed.
Retailers' tours to Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
Compared to February, the number of people walking to shopping malls in March fell by 33-43%.
Shopping mall operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check shoppers' temperatures, and cancelling ceremonies. According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty who would not be in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are trapped in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the US and the unemployment rate could fall to 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. Several million migrant workers (paid through daily wages) have been unemployed due to lockdown in India. A survey by the Angus Read Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some form of unemployment. 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the lockdown went into place in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for a universal loan scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on government-funded short-term working schemes called Kurzarbet.
The German short - term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organisations globally as well as individuals working and freelancing.
Arts and culture sector organisations endeavoured to maintain their (publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of their staff and the public and to support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions around the world and in different entries were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, ceremonies and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The rapidly growing outcome of another recent disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that observances of Holy Week in Rome, which take place during the last week of Lent's Christian mourning session, have been canceled.
Many bishops-districts have recommended that older Christians stay home rather than attend on Sundays in large numbers; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
As the Roman Catholic bishopric of Rome has closed its churches and synagogues and evacuated Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples and gurdwaras and restricted public services.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and later closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has created the most significant disruption to the sporting calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the planning of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to adopt the online approach, which has reported a significant increase in new sign-up rates at many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various musical groups suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many big theatres like Broadway ones also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as creating live streaming of concert programs or web-based "events" to promote the performance, distribution and promotion of artists' work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread as comedy and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been increasing prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and people with hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Many countries, especially Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia Pacific region have seen incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
The reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) documented the racial sentiments of Chinese people in various groups around the world of being worthy of receiving the virus or receiving a fair punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and people in the virus-affected areas.
Following the progress of the outbreak in hotspot countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may also experience suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to curb the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan became popular on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported rising levels of racial abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", which was considered racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students from North East India, which borders China, who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of Bharatiya Janata Party state unit in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "God has therefore taken revenge on them".
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the comment as "erroneous". In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents were fueled by the pandemic, which described foreigners as targets for "foreign garbage" and "disposal".
Several newspapers with paywalls removed them for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Several scientific publishers have made available scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of virus and to detect immunity produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunological detection (blood science) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Immunological tests show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who were symptomless.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in people.
Due to limited verification, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among people.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there is considerable disparity in how much testing has been done in different countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case mortality rate, which is likely to be significantly higher estimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasagrasni fae or bulgam samples, can be checked.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with throat sores is reliable only in the first week of disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, the sample material can alternatively be taken from the airway from the inside by suction catheter or coughing material (bulg) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in Berlin at Charité in January 2020, and formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed the test kit by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Koganbiotech developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (Powercheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It explores the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene found specifically in SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain approval for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 emergency use kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through International Reagent Resources.
Older versions of the test kit found inconclusive results due to defective reagents in one of the three genetic tests, and caused problems in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this caused the average of samples successfully processed to be less than 100 samples a day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable till 28 February 2020 and till then state and local laboratories were not allowed to initiate testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available nationwide by 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits have been announced; samples must be collected and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed the test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Rush Diagnostics was authorized by the FDA for high-dose testing within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 tests being performed from one machine over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermopisher Scientific.
Similarly, on 21 March 2020, Shepherd received EUA from the FDA for an examination that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can yield positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase production for 50,000 tests per day. A test kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal immunization specifically linked to the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein), with the hope that this can yield results in 15 to 20 minutes like an acute influenza test.
A review of literature from March 2020 concluded that early stage chest radiographs have little clinical significance, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.
The specific features of CT include bilateral multilayered ground-glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effects of subplural, madness and consolidation develop.
The study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the current source point of the pandemic, has suggested that, despite being less specific, it is significantly more sensitive than PCR, with many of the imaging characteristics of CT being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a test or first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary testing.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of immunosuppressants including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to determine immunity starting in individuals 7 days or around after onset of symptoms and to detect infection to monitor people. Tests can be tested in Central Laboratories (CLT) or by Point-of-Care Testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples may be used to observe the resistance response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
No first withdrawal step is required for testing other than PCR methods.On 26 March 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when required and are thus now able to deliver their immunological tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization. At the end of March 2020, EuroImmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for its test kits that can detect IgG and IgA immunity to viruses in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than traditional PCR testing of viral RNA.
Immunities can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the immunity testing kits they purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong has planned a plan in which suspect patients can stay at home, the Emergency Department will provide a sample tube to the patient, they will spit in it and return it and get the results of the examination soon. The British NHS announced that they are starting plans to check at home for suspect cases, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to hospital or eliminates the risk of disinfecting an ambulance used.
Drive-through checkpoints have helped to conduct the fastest, most comprehensive check-up of any country in South Korea. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the capacity to conduct about 12,000 check-ups daily in an ambulatory setting and 10,700 in the past week.
When the examination is ordered by the doctor, the cost is borne by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 checks per week.
Drive-through checks were offered in many major cities till March 19.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The laboratory survey found that as of week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested, including week 12/2020 and 33,491 (6.9%) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion & Rembrandt Hospital, by combining samples and if the combined sample is found positive, further tested and tested a method of testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously. In Wuhan, a temporary emergency laboratory of 2,000 square meters, called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English), was first discovered by BGI on 5 February 2020, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model observes that if this screening capacity were not started, the number of cases in Hubei would be 47% higher and the related cost of dealing with quarantine would be doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory has been followed immediately by Hu-yen Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 checks per day. Multi-signature open source frameworks have been released by Origami Essai that can test up to a maximum of 1122 samples of COVID19 patients using 93 tests. These balanced frameworks can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
Prior to March, the shortcomings of the reagent and insufficient quantities were a problem in large scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to explore prototyping protocols that included heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing its population for coronavirus more than any other country at a per capita rate, and was on track to increase testing levels to reach a larger population.
This was due to a combination of drive-through testing capabilities and the purchase of a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency time testing laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside of China.
Different testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent the German method for the production of kits for self-development to resource - deprived low - income countries.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. At the start of the outbreak, there were problems on the reliability of testing kits between China and the United States and these countries and Australia were unable to supply sufficient kits to meet the demands and recommendations of testing experts from healthcare.
Conversely, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped to reduce the spread of novel coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, especially in private sector laboratories, were developed over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing screening programs is the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the widespread spread of the virus, the high demand for screening has led to thousands of outstanding screening in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of fertilizers and chemical reagents becoming strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its test kits.
In the United States, testing kits developed by the CDC were in short supply; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biogeo Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found the results were not accurate.
The firm said that the wrong results could be due to failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the mischecking kits and replace them with another test kit made available by Shenzhen Biogas. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be placed in the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a high error rate and did not use them.
The quarantine of those who tested positive and the detection of those who came into contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the town of Vò, Italy, where the first death from COVID-19 occurred, tested twice on the entire population of about 3,400 people over a period of about ten days.
About half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and all those with detected cases were quarantined.
The travel ban on entry and exit completely eliminated new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic is growing significantly slower in Singapore than in other developed countries, by aggressively detecting contacts, restricting internal travel, checking and quarantining, but without enforcing extreme restrictions such as closing down restaurants and retail establishments.
Many programs have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from 28 March, but reopened on time on 23 March after school holidays.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea have also managed the pandemic by aggressively detecting contacts, restricting internal travel, checking and quarantining, but with less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with higher death toll checks have very low death rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to test and have limited experience in COVID-19 in national laboratories send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the %s column of positive in the tests is affected by the country's check policy.
Similarly, a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than a country where all citizens are tested, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning your hands for the purpose of removing dirt, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at any "emergency" time during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and haja, which are transmitted through the urinary tract.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five important moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after urination, after cleaning the baby's hips or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and before cooking or after consuming raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After spraying, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to clean pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
It is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important activity for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduction of infant mortality in home birth cases.
A 2013 study showed that good hand washing practices in children under five years of age can slightly improve their length.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Hand washing measures can reduce cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap, as an self-imposed behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world, is the only effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI).
A major ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with an estimated 18 lakh children dying each year.
About 35 lakh children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap a strong habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or therapeutic measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by about half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other cleaning measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, layered skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health professionals.
Hand washing is also often seen as a symptom of obsessive - compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the disease through the fecal route: after using the toilet (urine immersion, fecal-abandonment), after cleaning the baby's hips (after changing the diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food or before/after consumption of raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when proper hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent the transmission of disease are: before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the US had a moderate rate of 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate of 23 percent. Many behavioral change methods are now available to enhance hand washing with soap at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of massive action to promote children's health and education.
The national programme includes daily tooth brushing with basic fluoride as well as daily hand washing with soap, taking an antiseptic treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be improved by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin purifier because the fat and protein, which are components of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, adequate water flow helps in cleaning.
Repeated use can result in bacteria remaining from previous uses in solid soaps.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to the washing of bacteria with the soap.
Yet, according to the CDC, "measurements with a facility to pour liquid soap on the hands without touching the hands are better".
Antimicrobial soaps have been promoted to a health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic - resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of resistant species of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not produced by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are promoted to be.
In addition to moisturizers and skin-protective agents, refined formulations may include acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), microbiologically active benzoic acid and other skin adaptants (alveolar, vitamin, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that simple soaps, containing trichlorous, consumer-grade bacterial soaps, are as effective at preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibiotics.
Hand washing is comfortable hot water is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very rapidly at body temperature (37°C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water for removing soil and bacterial-containing natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a hand sanitizer with a water - free base.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the use of alcohol-based water-free hand sanitizer agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these isopropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which is formulated with glycerin in a gel such as a carboromer (polymer of acrylic acid), or a moisturizer such as a liquid or foam, for ease of use and to reduce the effect of drying the alcohol.
The combination of hydrogen peroxide and tannu increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol Rabb sanitizer destroys bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and the scabies.
Alcohol rub sanitizer containing 70% alcohol destroys 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of application (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibels reduction) and 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria (4 to 5 log reduction) after 1 minute of application. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk) types of viruses that are the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal disorders.
Both the front and back of the hands and the middle and all the finger pores are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, jelly or gel dries.
The fingers should also be washed well by rubbing both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when hands appear dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick disinfectant activation against microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are mixed in the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by mixing glycerin and/ or other lubricants in the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing lubricants significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Exposures that rarely cause allergies to the additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs are dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity.
The low tendency to induce dermatitis, which was more disturbing than hand washing with soap and water, became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not clean organic matter by hand, but simply disinfect it.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of pathogens as soap and water, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol - free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulations, and historically they have been significantly lower in performance than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce effectiveness after repeated use due to possibly progressive adverse skin reactions, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application of formulations using chloride.
Many people in low income communities cannot buy soap and can use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil alone can be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when exposed to water.
WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The proper hand washing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended as basins with stable water can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Make a smooth, smooth soap on the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are released from prolonged rubbing.
Wash well under running water.
Hands can be contaminated again by washing in the basin.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re - contaminated. The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, wrist, middle fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and pinched nail polishes can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing, as needed, for example using a hanging water softener or a water softener with suitable holes and/or ash. In conditions of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water conservation solutions are available, such as "tippi-taps" and other low cost options.
Tipping - tap is a simple technique in which a leg - driven lever, used to pour a small amount of water on the hands and soap ticks, is used to hang the jug by rope.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective way of drying in public toilets.
Large-scale research shows that paper towels provide more hygiene than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the Paper Towel Industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with hot air dryers, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on the average of the fingertips and 254% on the palms.
Drying with jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria on average by 42% on the fingertips and 15% on the palms.
After hand washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on finger pads and 77% on the palms. Scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in cross-contamination of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which drains air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and unit and possibly contaminating other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot air hand dryer microorganisms spread from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various methods of hand drying.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying of hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels for drying.
Hand washing using hand wash wipes is an option in the absence of soap and water during the trip.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing became mandatory long after the discovery (1846) by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis of its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when they forget.
One study has found that their use has reduced the infection rate.
Hands are medically washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, using a proper amount of soap and water or gel, and each part of the hands is rubbed.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed together.
If there is garbage under the nails, a hard haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water on the hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
It prevents the hand from being contaminated again by those surfaces.
Hand washing in healthcare systems is aimed at removing pathogenic microorganisms ("microorganisms") and preventing them from being transmitted.
Handwashing in most medical settings remains unacceptable, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, causing microorganisms to spread, according to a report by The New England Journal of Medicine.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in healthcare areas.
The hand sanitization manual available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was carried out by Witby et al.
If regulatory compliance is required, commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization has designated "five occasions" for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/ body fluids
before the disinfectant action, and
After patient care. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soap) provides lethal ability to the hand washing agent.
Such a lethal capacity may be desirable before surgery or in a setting where antibiotic resistance is highly prevalent. To 'rub' your hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching by hand, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, disinfected towels to dry hands after washing, and a disinfected brush and another disinfected means for cleaning under the nails, for cleaning the rub.
All jewelry must be removed.
The procedure usually requires washing the wrists from the hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
No need to rub for long periods (10 minutes).
When washing, water on wrists should be prevented from coming back to hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of Staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when hand cleaning frequency was increased by more than 35%, very little additional benefit was achieved.
Hand washing with plain soap leads to more than three times the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease compared to hand washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand washing with alcohol based solution to hand washing with antibacterial soap for a mean time of 30 minutes, it was found that hand washing with alcohol reduces bacterial contamination by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce H1N1 Influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile germs from hands. Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare systems may include education of employees on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed on which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an affordable, essential means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal handwashing practices in people's homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge due to the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities.
For example, in most rural Africa, every private or public toilet has very few hand washing faucets, even though there are cheap options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to the habit of washing hands rather than the lack of soap or water.
Encouragement and support for hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and change the long-term behaviour of the population.
To function effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social promotion campaigns are less effective. An example for promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Method" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap along with other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars respectively.
The creation of hand washing stations can be part of hand washing campaigns which are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign aimed at trying to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the prevention of DALYs.
However, one review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is considerably more cost effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing to human health - especially for people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to children or in soldiers injured in hospitals - was first identified in the mid-19th century by two promoters of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the Englishman who is "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people believed that infections were caused by a stench called miasmus.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a critical way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung near hand wash sinks in public toilets and office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "wash your hands of something" means to declare your unwillingness to accept responsibility for or share in it.
It comes from the Bible chapter of Matthew where Pontius Pilate distanced himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clear a fictional stain that reflected her guilty conscience about the crimes she committed and how she had induced her husband to commit the crime.
It has also been found that after recalling or reflecting on unethical actions, people wash their hands more often than others, and place more importance on hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" complementary activities such as volunteering.
Hand washing without soap water for hand washing is a part of the formal hand washing described in many religions including Bahá'íism, Hinduism, Tevila and Natillat Yadīyim in Judaism, Lawabō in Christianity, and Wazu in Islam.
Hand washing is mandatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam after using the toilet.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, hand washing is mandatory before and after every meal.
Control of the dangers of COVID-19 infection spread in the workplace
The application of occupational safety and health practices to control the risks of spread of COVID-19 infection in the workplace, to prevent the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to control the risks.
Proper control of the risk of disease spread in the workplace depends on the workplace and work to be done, based on risk assessment of sources of contact, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors of individual personnel who are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact occupations have minimal occupational contact with people and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, following respiratory manners, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Moderate contact risk tasks are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19 infection but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes staff who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population density work environments, and some high volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the measures for controlling the threats to this group include: transmission from high-efficiency air filters, use of snipe guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for the situation if the COVID-19 infected person is exposed.
OSHA considers healthcare personnel and mortuary personnel to be at high exposure risk who come into contact with a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk becomes a high exposure risk if the personnel perform aerosol generating procedures on a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, or collect or handle samples from them.
The controls of hazards suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure transmission chamber and personal safety equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreak can have many effects within the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, need to care for others or fear of possible contact.
The nature of trade can change in relation to both what goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as less time of demand or delivery or purchasing through moving services).
Finally, the movement of goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparedness and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the various levels of risk associated with workplaces and job functions, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from home and community arrangements, and risk factors for individual personnel such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the necessary controls to address the risks and contingency plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response schemes for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The targets of response to an outbreak include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting those at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the business community affects the responses that are taken.
A sequence of hazard controls is a structure widely used to group hazard controls according to their effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering control, followed by administrative control and finally personal safety devices.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without depending on the employee's behavior, and this may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or processes that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
Personnel should be selected on the basis of risk, appropriate PPE (e.g. respirator), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and changed as necessary, and disposed of to be properly removed, cleaned and stored or to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk jobs have minimal professional contact with people and other coworkers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: frequent and well-washed hands, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are ill, providing respiratory manners covering coughs and sneezing, tissue and waste vessels, preparing remote or parallel pallets if necessary, discouraging staff from using other people's tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Prompt identification and isolation of potentially contagious persons in the workplace is an important step towards the safety of personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute obstructive sleep apnea stay home as long as they are free of fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, and that disease leave policies be flexible that allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate contact risk tasks include those tasks that require frequent or close contact with people within six feet (1.8 meters) who are not known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the individual has recently travelled internationally to a place of widespread COVID-19 transmission.
They include personnel with public contact such as schools, high population density work environments, and some high volume sales arrangements. Engineering controls for this and high risk groups include setting up high-efficiency air filters, increasing the transmission rate, setting up physical barriers such as transparent plastic snipe guards, and setting up drive-through windows for customer service. Administrative controls for this and high risk groups include encouraging sick personnel to stay at home, changing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing parallel sails, preventing unnecessary travel to COVID-19 outbreaks locations, developing emergency communication safety plans to ensure limited access to safe places, including the need to reduce the risk of exposure to public health or other hazards of personal work, including the need to provide personal and workplace safety measures, providing training and equipment, providing training and equipment to personnel who may be exposed to COVID-19, and providing personal protective equipment, including the use of personal and hand washing equipment, and the need to develop a safety plan to reduce the risk of personal and occupational hazards, including the need to reduce the use of personal protective equipment and equipment, and the need to provide personal protective measures to employees who are exposed to COVID-19 and other forms of personal hazards.
Personnel in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person from others by 6 feet, appointing a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or telling the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, they should potentially wear additional personal protective equipment.
For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the dangers of cancellation of travel should be controlled and self-isolation and immediate notification to the onboard medical centre if a person develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the isolationist's room. For schools and infant care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building that is devoid of community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as cancelling meals in physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing distance between desks, balancing arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with symptoms such as flu.
Extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies when there is sufficient transmission in the local community. For law enforcement personnel performing daily law enforcement activities, immediate health risks are considered by the CDC to be as follows.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact persons confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during capture, personnel must clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment using household cleaning spray or wipes before reuse, and follow standard operating procedures for sealing and disposal of used PPE and for sealing and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary personnel to be in high or ultra-high categories of exposure risk.
High exposure risk tasks include providing healthcare, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These contacts become very high risk if personnel perform aerosol generating procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, collecting or handling samples from them.
Aerosol generating processes include tube insertion, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or sample collection from the tear-drop.
High-contact risk mortuary operations involve people who prepare the bodies of persons with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if they examine the corpses they become very high-contact risk. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include quarantine rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including during the conduct of aerosol generating procedures.
Specific negative pressure transmission may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary settings.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in separate waiting areas. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the US, N95 filtered facial respirators or better approved by NIOSH should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes fitness testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend covers, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through physical fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, chounga and gloves.
If an aerosol generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE by telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a single COVID-19 patient, using only PPE needed for specific function, using the same respirator without removal during care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, inspecting and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for symptomatic individuals.

This month, we are surrounded by extraordinary circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that all human beings in the world are connected and have a responsibility to each other.
The challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global compassion, mutual cooperation, and community building, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of friendship we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and chats is an extraordinary testimony to how extraordinary we have been privileged to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as colleagues that words cannot express.
Last week a person shared with me a compliment of our work.
It reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to keep this extremely important resource online and accessible to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether you're running sites or being a source of pay for our colleagues or protecting our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia has, and now it needs it most.
This is a moment in which our work, and the way we do it, will both have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes to the way we work with us from this coming week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C - team met last night to discuss our methodology and to prepare a timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response that our thinking would have to the situation before us, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve the tension and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to reduce your workload, there is nothing wrong with that.
For all staff, contractors, and contract staff:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work longer than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at this time, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not keeping track of your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It's not necessary to say it, but we are saying it.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work are not seen by anyone.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can assist you and ensure that appropriate management attention is given to your situation.)
Hourly workers will be paid full salary.
We have already said, and we are reaffirming our commitment to fulfill our promise to our contractors and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid according to his normal working hours during normal circumstances.
You will get paid even if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we're with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get out of the stresses of the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially at such a time.
Again, it is most important that you take care of yourself.
We suggest that you talk to your manager so we know what to expect, and then we can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we cannot let stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security, and Grant Collection Teams (and others) perform crucial tasks that may require additional cooperation.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the existing objectives and focus our attention on cooperating with the essential things for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we will all just focus on the most necessary projects.
Slowing down now will save us from injury later.
There is no plan to double our time for self-sufficiency after the global pandemic has passed.
You will no longer be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that have gone beyond reality.
We believe that the circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and deadlines where appropriate.
What about APP?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily work hours, we would like to re-adjust the timeline for completing our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow us more time to budget so that employees can prioritize their critical work, taking care of themselves, and taking care of loved ones, and to accommodate those who need or want to work on the schedule that has been cut down over the coming few weeks.
This extension of the timeframe will significantly reduce our current planning workload and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and as soon as we receive confirmation we will inform the representatives and teams of the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, contact, and cleaning
Last week we learned that a colleague in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great care, we deployed an antiviral cleaning staff to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
He disinfected every surface, lobby, and elevator bank that came to our floor from hospital-grade antiviral solutions.
The building is implementing its own care - duty protocol using products that assist the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that when we return the office will be fully ready.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members in DC.
Last week our DC office adopted a completely remote system in line with shared guidance from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in NYC know, there is also a discussion of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home/remote for the first time.
Our longtime remote workers know that this will require adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit meeting times to a maximum of one or two hour increases.
And if long sessions are needed, consider dividing them into several days.
Defining meetings clearly, preparing the agenda, and sending reading material in advance.
Make videos your default option with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and integration.
Take initiatives to facilitate each meeting, one person monitor the chat for questions and keep track of the speaker list, and one person help take notes (or take notes in collaboration)
If you need a comfortable headset, email Tech Support.
Use your health allowance for short - term.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work.
HR Operations Team is investigating webinar based manpower guidance to support the growth in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community-funded clients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Editathon, etc. until the WHO announces the end of the global pandemic.
We informed them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one will be penalized for being forced to delay or modify those targets.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance regarding Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
This barrier seems to have a widespread sense of grief in the entire global community but also a sense of relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikipedia and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch about COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are together in these situations and are there to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from this email on Office Wiki, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or a coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please do not hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We are here to provide assistance and help in establishing relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please email Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a renunciation of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our tasks and responsibilities are likely to need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
We believe that these steps are necessary for us to help each other so that we can continue to act, provide our activities with the cooperation they need, and provide the service on which the world depends.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Right now, it is time to help each other, and make room for important work in the coming weeks and possibly months ahead.
To make this possible, we need all of you, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Jenin U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 is a zinc - containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of the inner membrane and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidease M2 domain and the C-terminal electrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with an unfolded enzyme-activated domain on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is disrupted by another enzyme called shades from the parasymphatic domain, and the resulting soluble protein becomes free in the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membrane of type II pulmonary venous cells, small intestinal enterocytes, intracellular cells of the arteries and veins and soft tissue cells of the arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter - load to ACE.
ACE angiotensin I breaks down the hormone into vascular contractor angiotensin II.
ACE2 then dissolves the carboxylic-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and water - dissolves it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 [des-Arg9]- can also dissolve many other peptides including bradyquinine, epelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the membrane transport of the indifferent amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and has been reported to play a role in Hartonup disease.
As a membrane protein, it serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses including ACE2, HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-generating virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-generating virus).
More specifically, binding to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 contact S1 protein transfers both virus and enzyme to endocytosis and endosomes located within cells.
This entry process also requires the activation of S protein by nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, which is currently under investigation as a potential therapy for its inhibition.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy continue.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Also, "Patients treated with ACE inhibitors also had a reduced risk of pneumonia, which were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in those with trauma and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced rates of pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less pronounced than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pig infants with lipolipolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the initiation of action with a 24-hour course of action (period) is 30 minutes.
The findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases with increased circulatory angiotensin II.
The apps are mobile software applications, which are designed to assist in contact tracing, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
In some areas and jurisdictions, several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
The less intermittent option involves using a Bluetooth signal to log proximity to a user's other cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has deployed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and will be available for planning within weeks. Similar app ("StopCovid") has also been deployed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering Singapore's TraceTogether app and apps based on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and a potential lack of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited to only "official" or otherwise reputable organizations, determining what types of organizations can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the implications of massive surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed after this threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issued a statement for limits on such surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions on government projects:
The monitoring shall be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
There should be a concluding clause for the extension of supervision and supervision;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and demonstrated to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be avoided from promoting discrimination and disenfranchisement;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
Measures for protecting the rights of citizens should be taken to respond to and abuse;
"Significant participation" will be required by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and unauthorized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Grenzen) (RSF) have also released a checklist.
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple scheme is to solve the problem of constant monitoring by removing tracing mechanisms from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use the central server for intercommunication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to trace contacts in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Many countries including Germany considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, these details have not yet been released.
Privacy-protected contact tracing has been a well-established concept with a large body of research literature since at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log proximity to a user's other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort involving both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matches are on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protection techniques when collecting and using location or path interception data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the March 2020 white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic". A similar effort is SafeTrace by privacy technology developer Enigma MPC, which was originally set up at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was established by groups that were essentially organized in the context of a common approach and broadly similar protocols aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling the global interactivity of tracking and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving broad optimization.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has opened-source the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies controlling the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, claiming that this Bluetooth will protect privacy based on a combination of low energy technology and privacy-protected cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three stages:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protected coronavirus tracking apps
This functionality is directly available on iOS and Android
Drug reuse (also known as drug reuse, reprofiling, re-assignment or therapeutic change) is the reuse of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and health-related plasma addressing. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides a reasonable project to develop an effective antiviral drug to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the papen-like proteases, RNA dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribophosphates.
Hussain et al. studied several candidate compounds, which were then adapted and analyzed for similarity of their structure to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in a pre-clinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti - malaria drug that is also used to protect against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine will be among the four drugs being studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York announced that testing of New York State's chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorophyll phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial procedure and is only authorized under EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokoquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Big studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir to be "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative on average for 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients received favipiravir and half received omefenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is very small and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase medicines from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver medicines to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of a combination of antiviral lopinovirus and retinovirus, lopinovirus/retinovirus (Calatra), concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to proteases of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources for the reuse of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial ambient antiviral activation to protect against several phylloxera, pneumo-, paramix- and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials run by the University Hospital of Cleveland; one for people with moderate disease and the other for people with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Tygins alvesco (cyclosodine), an intravenous corticosteroid for asthma, to treat patients with symptoms of novel coronavirus before they show symptoms.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients admitted from serious, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA is addressing 6000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are experiencing mild symptoms for which no hospital admission is required.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several scandals are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, which is why the Italian Medicines Agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multi-central study on 300 patients researching the use of anoxaparin sodium at immunotherapeutic and therapeutic doses was announced on 14 April in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the re-purpose of approved antiviral drugs, which were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribarine: Ribarine was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umfenovir: Umfenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to the guidelines of Chinese 7th edition
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potential reusable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Tests in Italy and China as well. and See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine for protection against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many efforts are still being made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect to have a vaccine available in less than 18 months to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase 1 safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
The imperatives of CEPI initiative for vaccine development, as stated in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, mass planning and global learning.
In April, CEPI scientists informed that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the start of 2020 to develop an effective vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
Advanced Key Platform Goals in Phase I Security Studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been announced, but little public information is available (designed or envisaged in planning).
A Phase I-II trial involves preliminary safety and immunity tests, usually performed at random, placebo-controlled and multiple sites, setting more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, with a control group monitoring adverse effects at optimal doses, and testing the efficacy of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
The vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around January 29, 2020, Yanssen Pharmaceutical Company led by Haneke Shutemaker announced that it had started work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, Laboratory Oncogene in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technique used for cancer neonantigen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that he has finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and is starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, a Generex subsidiary, Nugenex Immuno-Oncology announced that they are launching a vaccine project to develop a Li-Key Peptide vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materials Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, Western Maryland both announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was engaged in developing and manufacturing a vaccine.
Novavax Inc. will work closely with the company.
The partners announced plans for preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health, India announced that it is working with 11 developers, and that it will take at least two and a half years to develop a vaccine even on a short-term basis.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company, Medicago, in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate is in laboratory research, with a human trial planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered Curvac "a large sum for the special acquisition of a COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government opposed.
On March 17, 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical trials, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, in Italy, an Italian biotechnology company Taxis Biotech announced that they will have preclinical test results in April 2020 and trials on their final vaccine candidate may begin by autumn.
On 19 March 2020, in France, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Association, which includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which makes CEPI's total investment of US$29 million in COVID-19 vaccine development.
Other investment partners of CEPI for the development of COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovaio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists have started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-promoted RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically with a plan to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of other coronavirus outbreaks.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine PittCoVacc in mice, stating that "MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines have induced antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice], which became apparent to begin 2 weeks after vaccination".
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities combined resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers, with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have anomalous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they may have additional benefits for the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking for 4,170 health workers to be admitted.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Preliminary research assessing the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate the need for biosecurity level 3 containment measures to deal with living viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models for protection against SARS and MERS.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments to protect against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based) MERS vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all viral vectored vaccines, two adenoviral vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by social media posts refer to existing patents for various genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days but it can be as long as two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases symptoms are mild, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop.
As of 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads among people during close contact, often through small drops produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall on the ground or surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a dirty surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before and during the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the sternum of a nasagrasony.
We recommend wearing a mask for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and also for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Most of the countries in all six WHO regions have recorded local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may be symptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, dizziness, difficulty waking up and blue of face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose or throat lumps can be seen.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases in China, initially only chest stiffness and sharp beatings were observed.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the emergence period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals developing symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The reports indicate that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The role of these transient carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases were transient during their stay in hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-invasive cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of 166 infections that day were non-invasive at the time of testing.
Both the bladder and larvae can contain a large amount of viral infection.
Speaking out loud produces more droplets than speaking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough can cause drops up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) in length.
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors in corridors outside people's rooms came back positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as duct penetration and cardiac pulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to form aerosols and thus airborne propagation.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, the risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although it is possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person typically infects two to three other individuals.
In particular, the virus was detectable for one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on 99% copper.
Even so, it varies according to humidity and temperature.
If used properly soaps and detergents are also effective; soap products disintegrate the fatty protective layer of viruses, disabling them, as well as freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solvents, such as benzalconum chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, larval samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral volume, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral volume on the second day of testing.
Acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective lining. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 as the virus reaches nutrient cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II lung cellular cells.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "Peploomer" to bind to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of the infected people hospitalized had acute heart damage and it is more common in severe illness.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to the coronary inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venereal thromboembolism (25%) among ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor disease diagnosis, has been found. Examinations of people dying from COVID-19 have found radiation-damaged aircellate damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing exogenous substances within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a follow-up to the respiratory route ACE2-disclosing epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of coronary hypertension.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretory T-cells were shown to be correlated with selection of pathogenic IL-6-secretory monocytes in COVID-19 patients and severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic exteriors have also been reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasagrassney's jaw; however, a nose jaw or a bladder sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but these require two blood samples taken at two week intervals and the results are of low immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the US approved the first care-on-site trial for use later that month on March 21, 2020. The clinical guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outlined ways to detect infection based on clinical facilities and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral polygonal ground - glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetric and post - distribution are common in early transitions.
Subplural dominance, crazy pewing (thickening of the patchy walls with variable airway fillers), and densification may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few statistics available on the micro-wounds and disease physiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: Shoots in the lung lining, pericarditis, congestion of the lungs and pulmonary shock
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Pneumonia: pulmonary shortage, excess of the lymphocytes, large irregular lymphocytes, spatial inflammation with lymphocytic endosperms and large multicenter cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Radiation-induced airborne damage (DAD) with radiation-induced airborne leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe dehydration.
Treating pneumonia: management of leaks and pulmonary fibrosis in the airway cavities
Blood: circulating intercellular scan (DIC); leukoarythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water repeatedly and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has partially recommended the use of face-covering in public settings to limit transmission by non-instantaneous individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
Since no vaccine is expected by at least 2021, an important part of managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called "reducing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty, before eating and after spraying, coughing or sneezing their nose.
In addition, it recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action is generated from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to aid in the elimination of bacterial germs in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand repellent".
Glycerol is mixed as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include providing liquid therapy, oxygen assistance and other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxidation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still pending.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Auxiliary treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intuitionists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings, when aerosol generating procedures such as tube insertion or hand transmission are performed.
For healthcare personnel caring for persons infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the individual in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions.
Recommended equipment is: PPE chounga, respirator or face mask, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves. Where available, respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial applications, but the FDA has authorized the mask for use under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness towards a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-approved experiments.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical transmission or other alternatives, but a few percent of cases are required.
The type of respiratory aid for COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people, with some evidence that high flow nasal passage or bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided from tube penetration.
Whether either of these provides the same benefits to seriously ill people is unknown.
Some physicians prefer to use inductive mechanical induction when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal induction. Severe cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of a health system to handle the sudden increase in the number of sufficiently serious COVID-19 cases that makes hospitalization necessary.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for transmission, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have finally been admitted to ICU.
Mechanical transmission becomes more complicated as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygen delivery becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure control systems and high PEEP-enabled ventilators are required to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing lung damage and pneumothorax risk.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has provisionally authorized health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of an individual is seriously or immediately threatened.
No clinical studies have been conducted to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to tackle the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect potential risk of infection by detecting 'close contacts' using monitoring data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analytics for cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus victims.
The measure was taken to implement quarantine and protect people coming into contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared joint phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency for prevention and research of the spread of the virus.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italian regional health commissioner Julio Gallerà said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way".
The German government organized a 48 hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kirsti Kaljulad, has called for a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
"Growing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm to damage people's mental health and wellbeing", said Rory O'Connor, quoted by the BBC.
The disease may have a mild course of action with or without some symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or acute illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at high risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 can develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, pulmonary trauma or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include nausea, abnormal scarring and damage to heart, kidneys and liver.
Scanning abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of hospitalized people with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function has been observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same information, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days spent in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in ICU transferred patients was seven days.
In one study of early cases, the average time from showing early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate in men was 2.8% while the mortality rate in women was 1.7%.
Tissue deformity examinations of samples of cadaver samples of the lungs show radiation-induced aerobic damage with cellular fibromycoside leaks in both lungs.
Viral cell deformation changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs looked similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the US, 89% of people admitted to hospital had preexisting conditions. Availability of medical resources and socioeconomic status of a region can also affect mortality.
The estimated mortality rate from the condition also varies due to those regional differences and system related difficulties.
The mortality rate can be overestimated due to the low count of mild cases.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and were about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post - intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as a potential based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for coronavirus have been reported at a later date after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse than a recurrent infection.
The virus is considered to be of an animal origin spread through natural and animal - to - human transmission.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was reported as 1 December 2019.
Official publications of WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of testing, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, time from initial outbreak to last and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO determined the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease code U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of persons diagnosed to die from a disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR) which represents the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not timely and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of immunity can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the center of the outbreak in Italy, in Castiglione d'Aeda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelet, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, reducing the mortality rate relatively, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
Moreover, the German health system is not extreme.
In the Netherlands, as assessed by blood donors, about 3% can be immune.
69 (0.004% of population) deaths from COVID-19 have been confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy show that the mortality rate among men is higher.
The greatest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women only narrows at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact causes of this gender gap are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, low prevalence of smoking in women and the development of co-patient conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those dying from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government is not monitoring gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Head Tedros Adnanom Gabreyasas said that CO means Corona, VI means Virus, D means Disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified, namely 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, which are consistent with international recommendations for naming for the purpose of preventing offending. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease of acute respiratory disease, which complies with the 2015 guidelines on not using places in disease and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials such as Nasika Fah and parts of ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital immediately needed ventilation valves, and the supplier was unable to provide the required timeframe, a local startup printed 100 valves needed overnight by reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracies, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "Solidarity Trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hopes for effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available at this time, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 graphite to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First, the researchers aim to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inert or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system susceptible to certain sub-parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-contact proteins that help the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme graft.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine making technique).
Trial vaccines of any of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
Vaccines have a harmless genetic code copied from disease-causing viruses. Antibody dependent growth has been cited as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating pre-approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
With nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir scheduled to be reported by the end of April in several countries, reusable antiviral drugs are being worked on in most Chinese research.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was underway. Several existing antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, combined with Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon Beta.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence for the effectiveness of Remdesivir is available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with unapproved use of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied with preliminary results in China in February 2020.
However, there have been calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice that dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Chinese 7th version guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umfenovir for use for protection against COVID-19.
Initial data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required for the suppression of the synthetic parasite SARS-CoV-2.
Nitasoxanoid has been recommended for further study in organisms after demonstrating low-concentration suppression of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) by the initial contact protein priming, ACE2 graphite, by end-action is required.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Osaltamivir does not inhibit the synthetic parasitic SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Increasing cytokine levels in the post-COVID-19 stages can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti - cytokine properties. After a small study was completed, Tokilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China.
It is undergoing a Phase 2 non-randomized trial nationally in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
In conjunction with serum ferritin blood tests to identify increased levels of cytokine, it is intended to address such increases, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of steroid-induced cytokine release syndrome induced by CAR T cell therapy for a different cause, based on case studies.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring pure and concentrated immunes produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral indifference is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms of action, such as antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal immunosuppressants, are in development.
The production of health - benefiting serum, which contains liquid components of the blood of recovered patients and has specific immunity to the virus, can be increased for rapid planning.
