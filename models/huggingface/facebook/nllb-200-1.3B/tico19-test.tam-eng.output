Rapidly increasing subsequent incidents of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK from 1st January to 15th March 2020.
The gradual trend of the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has ensured that the COVID-19 pandemic, with different build-up in each country, is progressing rapidly in all countries, with a similar trend across the EU/EEA and the UK.
Based on the experience gained from Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs, should increase preparedness for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent is a new strain of coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the decline in health caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
According to available sources, approximately 80% of individuals infected with COVID-19 have had moderate illness, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these are cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes an additional serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develops a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, and compare them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with those in Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Following China, COVID-19 spread more geographically, and the rest of the world is now tracking the status of the COVID-19 epidemic in this country.
On 11th March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri and others reported Europe's first confirmed cases of COVID-19 as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were those who returned to France from Wuhan, Hubei, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, resulting in 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and the same date, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths have been recorded in Italy alone.
Subsequent figures and subsequent events on COVID-19 cases are being obtained.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates only the official figures on reported COVID-19 cases from the Ministry of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities and WHO of each country globally, daily at 8 am.
The data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EU economies and the UK and compare it to the trend in Italy.
In response to the current COVID-19 case area, we calculated the 14 day rapid overall cases of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period from 1st January to 15th March 2020.
As of 8am on 15th March 2020, we have provided a stacked number of cases per country, compared to Italy, for the period from 31st January to 15th March 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The 14-day rapid overall trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK follows the trend of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
The gradual increase in COVID-19 spread across the EU/EEA and the UK started on 21 February and then accelerated on 28 February 2020 (Subject).
This has been largely achieved by the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown similar rising trends in subsequent cases of COVID-19 (sub-item).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases available when comparing Italy with EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
As of 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have already recorded their numbers in Italy, only 3 weeks earlier or earlier, relative to the previous year.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Looking at the overall trend of COVID-19 cases, it appears that measles is progressing relatively fast in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, national public health practices differ, different definitions of incidence are followed in different countries and different procedures are followed, including rapid testing to select patients to conduct testing for COVID-19 infection.
In early March 2020, doctors from affected areas of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients require intensive care, and media reports suggested that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas have reached peak purchasing capacity.
Data on COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level at 6% and 1% respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to support ongoing monitoring data focusing on the number of recorded cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed that Europe has a high disparity in the availability of ICU and ICU beds, with a rate of 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and ICU beds per 100,000 people in 2010-11).
In the context of healthcare capacity concentration models, ECDC Rapid Critical Level Assessment for COVID-19 has been given for the sixth time for each EU/EEA country and the UK, where COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital are estimated to have a 90% higher risk of increased patient numbers than ICU beds.
The EU/EEA countries and the UK have so far identified areas as vulnerability groups and as hospitals and ICUs typically serve the regional population, information on the incidence and ICU beds should be made available in the NTS-2 (Nord-West Neighbourhood Statistics) Module.
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs must thus prepare themselves for the prolonged social transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 infections, which may require healthcare, especially ICU, as has been the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As noted in the latest ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, shifting from mitigation to containment requires a proactive and all-inclusive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases will not allow time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt to the situation and respond.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to limit the impact of measles.
There is a small window of opportunity, and it is possible for countries to take advantage of it to further increase control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on the healthcare sector.
Failure to do so could lead to a dramatic increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks, which could affect the healthcare systems of EU/EEA countries.
The 2019 outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed 3,000 people in China and the rest of the world, infected 80,000 people and caused catastrophic human deaths.
Like the single-pathogen SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have spread from algae and may produce similar symptoms in a similar manner.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is also more transmissible, and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly emerging research material.
We will look at the basics of epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathobiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of recovery and prevention of disease.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this research will help us understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on 25th January 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable experience for all Chinese, who have been urged to stay indoors for weeks during and after the holiday season due to the spread of the new virus.
The characteristics of the virus are similar to those of the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, thus it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to some 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2nd March 2020, the number of confirmed cases of contagious COVID-19 has reached 80,000, of which 40,000 patients have been discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients have died.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is the "first common enemy", and that it is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report determining the pathogen sequence from various patients on 7th January 2020, more than 200 papers on the pathogenology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 have been published.
The presentation seeks to summarize the progress of research on a new and rapidly advancing subject.
Wherever possible, we try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronaviruses, including the Middle East Autism Syndrome (outbreak in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far on disease prevention and prediction and the remaining pressing questions.
As approximately 15% of common cold cases are caused by the common cold, coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens in humans.
However, in this century, we have faced two highly pathogenic human viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which started spreading in their early stages in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and spread to many more countries, causing severe illness and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in the recorded history of mankind.
The National Health Commission of China was first notified on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan of the presence of pneumonia in population groups of unknown origin, as shown in Figure 1.
Seven days later, the sequence of the COVID-19 virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the plague spread rapidly to neighboring cities and provinces and other countries.
On 20 January, there was a report of infection among healthcare providers, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, Wuhan was completely shut down and all public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that of the 41 infected patients, only 21 had time contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site of the initial spread of the infection from an unconfirmed animal.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread to China and nearly 50 countries worldwide (Figure 2).
The final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined as the context is changing rapidly.
In a multi-central study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 positive COVID-19 cases on 11 February 2020, more data on measles has been released as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but the primary victims are those aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50 years of age, with very few under 20 years of age, and only 14 of the infected individuals were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 is more prevalent among males (0.27/100,000) than females (0.31/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in Hubei and its surrounding areas.
It took an average of 5 (2-9) days for diagnosis since the onset of COVID-19.
The mean time interval between onset of symptoms is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R.0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the modified R.0, 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected before 23rd January 2020 was the fastest to match the mass traffic in China before the Spring Festival.
The mortality rate among the confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the modified mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Gender (male), age (60 and above) and severe pneumonia are the three major risk factors for COVID-19.
The coronaviruses belong to the subfamily of the large and enveloping single-stranded pathogen of the sensory and renal receptors (RNA).
They can be divided into four subtypes, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, where alpha-alpha and beta-CoVs have been shown to be infectious to humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cell receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and tipeptidyl peptidase 4 (TPP4), for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, followed by membrane binding.
In bacteria, RNA is released into the nucleus; after the replication of the pathogen, the encapsulated glycoprotein and protein-containing microorganism form a mature pathogen-containing nucleus that fuses with the cell membrane to express the pathogen.
The first genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on 10th January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of over 99.98% among 10 sequence samples collected at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the original site of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the myocardium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, coincidentally corresponding to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection than SARS-CoV-2 does.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a modern small protein encoded by ORF.3.P and an exoskeleton protein encoded by ORF8.
SARS-CoV-2's ORF.3.P may contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit expression of IFN beta, however, ORF8 does not have a known active domain or target.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others recorded the low-temperature electron microscope structure of the full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å, in combination with the amino acid transducer P.0.AT1.
The open and close exoskeleton linkage was synthesized as a binomial and the ACE2-B0AT1 linkage would bind the two S proteins, which are known to identify and transmit COVID-19.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for drug monitoring to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Starting and intermediate bearing
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated from whales and are known to have been transmitted to humans by cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing the evolutionary lineage of other CoVs with SARS-CoV-2, it is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 originally lived in bats, as the two SARS-like CoVs from the new pathogen strains, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, are 96% identical.
However, the cause of the virus's spread to humans across the racial line is still unknown, and the route of transmission is unclear.
Ji and others suggested that the virus from whales to humans may have been transmitted by snakes due to the similar rearrangement of their S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that the long-shell, ant-eating mammalian species most commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine may have been carriers of SARS-CoV-2 because the coronavirus found in the ants and SARS-CoV-2 are genetically 99% identical.
However, the one percent difference between the two genomes is still a big difference, and we are still waiting for reliable results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physiochemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet well understood.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in outdoor dry environments and up to 5 days in environments of 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be activated by UV and exposure to 56 °C for 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine, disinfectants, peroxide, chloroform and other fatty solvents will actively deactivate the pathogen, but chlorhexidine does not.
The entire human population is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, and is therefore vulnerable to novel virus infection.
Currently, there is no information on the detailed study of the immunization effects of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only validate previous studies on other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when a pathogen infects an infected person, it is first recognized by the infected person's immune system through similar recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, DAL-like receptors (DLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-like receptors (RLRs).
The pathogen stimulates the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of the renal cells, and the synthesis of type I inhibitory proteins (IFNs) in various ways, which limit the spread of the pathogen and increase the way in which the antibodies of the pathogen are ingested and destroyed in the blood glucose.
However, the n-protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus escape the immune response.
Soon, the mutant immune system joins the fight against the antibody.
The T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells activate B-cells to produce antibodies against the specific pathogen, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
To help the immune cells, the helper T cells produce cytokines that are beneficial to inflammation.
However, the coronavirus may cause the lymphocytes to die on their own, disrupting the function of the lymphocytes.
Immunity and other antibodies including complementary substances such as C.3.A and C.5.A are essential to fight infection.
For example, antibodies from recovered patients disabled MERS-KV.
On the other hand, the immune system will release a large number of endothelial molecules in the area due to overactivity, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case can cause various organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, with its group-initiating components, may be more prevalent in elderly people with both diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people with high levels of exposure to pathogens or with compromised immune function to be more susceptible to infection than others.
For SARS-CoV-2, the time interval between onset of symptoms, with a minimum of 1-14 days and a maximum of 3-7 days, was estimated based on a study of 425 infected people in Wuhan.
However, in a study of 1,099 patients, the time interval between onset of symptoms was reported to be an average of 3 days, and could range from 0 to 24 days.
In a very recent study, the time interval between onset of symptoms in a population of 8,866 cases as described above was confirmed to be 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adapting effective quarantine periods based on the duration of symptoms is a critical task for health authorities to do, as this will prevent infected but asymptomatic people from spreading the virus to others.
As a general practice, individuals who are exposed to the pathogen or have been infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The major and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fainting, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after infection, some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or blood loss.
In severe cases, patients developed symptoms of excessive appetite disorder, toxic shock, trans-ocular acidosis and coagulation.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be tested during the early stage of the diagnostic study, even if there are no pulmonary disorders.
A population survey conducted in late December 2019 showed 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath, 3% diarrhea as the percentages of symptoms; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group of individuals who have spread from an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 population survey found that the primary symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, as MERS is more deadly than COVID-19, 80% of them require more ventilation support than COVID-19 patients.
Stomach tenderness (26%) and throat irritation (21%) were also detected in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, diarrhea (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), constipation (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and ventilation was required in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the global number of confirmed cases was 66,576, while the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
By comparison, the Sars mortality rate was 10% of 8,096 infected people as of November 2002.
In Mersuk, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a population survey conducted in June 2012.
Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has been in the R.0, 2 to 4 range with R.0, 6.47 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23.
Comparisons of symptoms, mortality and R.0 between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to spread more than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the latter is less likely to cause death than the other two.
Thus, controlling SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than controlling MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The periodic onset of disease is gradual, such as in the same family or in the same group or in luxury vehicles such as ships.
Patients often have a medical history, such as having traveled to Wuhan or other affected areas, or having lived there, or having been in contact with infected individuals or patients two weeks before the outbreak began.
However, there have been reports that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital may be re-infected, sending a warning tone to increase the time for isolation.
In the early stages, patients have normal or low numbers of extra white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had lymphoma with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L, including a fluid count of less than 1×109/L, and high levels of aspartate amino transducer and microbe in the blood.
Some patients had increased liver and carbohydrate levels and muscle protein in the blood, and most patients had increased C-reactivity and serum cell count in the blood.
In the severely affected patients, the presence of the blood clotting agent T was high and the number of hemorrhoids was very low.
Most COVID-19 patients have been diagnosed with abnormal breast radiography and with a translucent condition such as bilateral flat shadows or rubbed glass in the lungs.
Patients may occasionally develop abnormal pneumonia, severe pulmonary injury and an increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive tissue enlargement actively compromise the gas exchange.
Activation of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes reduces the level of diffusion and increases the volume, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
So, poor breast radiographs sometimes reveal the severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 included the pathogenesis of pneumocytes, exfoliation and tissue interstitial drainage, and multiple-seat devices in the lungs of the deceased patient, as in SARS and MERS patients, which confirmed the pathogenesis of viral infection and ARDS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through residual replicating polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as a crucial command line for COVID-19 detection.
However, because of the false-negative rate, it can increase the incidence of measles, hospital manifestations in China on 13 February 2020 used diagnostic methods (not relying solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation has occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
However, information on pre-existing diseases, anatomical exposures, laboratory tests and radiological findings are essential and mandatory for proper diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Shang team described the process of detecting SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based technology, which involved the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA particle at a depth of 20 × 10-18 μL/L to 200 × 10-18 μL/L (10-100 copies per μL in input) within one hour, without the need for detailed instruments.
It is believed that if confirmed in clinical models, the new technology can dramatically improve sensory function and comfort.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoV, physicians are mainly providing supportive care to COVID-19 patients while trying different types of treatments previously used or proposed as treatment for other coronaviruses and other infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table (Table 2) 2).
Antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychosocial support are the current and most effective treatments.
The use of plasma from cured patients was also envisaged.
Pharmaceutical companies are rapidly competing to develop antibodies and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs and may also affect other organs such as the renal and endocrine system, which release ACE2.
However, respiratory failure or shortness of breath is the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygenation, high flow oxygenation, intramuscular ventilation and penetrating mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory syndrome should be supported by virtual jaw rejuvenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technology used to treat life-threatening heart attacks or respiratory arrest.
In addition, maintenance of electromolecular equilibrium, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and toxic shock, and protection of vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine cycles have been shown to be the result of an over-activation of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of volumetric inflammatory bowel movement that releases a sequence of cytokines including DNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and MCB-1.
These activators stimulate immune cells to release endothelial molecules, which are the main cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine streams, especially in the treatment of acute patients.
Proteinetral and IL-6 resistant single-cell antibody, Tassilsumab, has been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other treatments for immunosuppression of cytokine storm include modification of the D-Uyran cell-driven immune response; inhibition of IFN-gamma, IL-1 and DNF; JAK suppression, exogenous monophobia; suppression of cytokine signal 4; and HTAC suppression.
Steroids have been widely used as immunosuppressants in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not effective in patients with severe lung injury due to SARS and COVID-19.
The answer is that they can cause serious side effects, especially bone loss without blood flow, which can have a major impact on prognosis.
However, it is recommended that proteoctone be administered to life-threatening COVID-19 patients for a short period of time, at least at moderate doses.
At the time of writing, no effective antimicrobial treatment has been confirmed.
However, intravenous injection of remdesivir, a sequence of utric acid-based drugs, has been found to have the desired effect in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel anti-bacterial drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg-related diseases.
Later, even remdesivir showed its ability to suppress other single-stranded RNAs, including MERS and SARS.
On the basis of these, the GILID has provided China with a joint instrument to conduct tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the results of which are highly anticipated.
In addition, Parasitinib, Interferon-alpha, Lopinvir/Retonavir and Ribavirin are recommended as standard treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other undesirable effects may occur.
The interplay of these treatments with other medications given to patients should also be carefully monitored.
Plasma and other antibodies from recovered patients.
The practice of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease and then treating other patients with the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
In fact, the cured patients had a higher level of antibodies in their blood compared to the pathogens.
Antibodies are antibodies (IGs) that are produced by B-cell cells to fight off pathogens and other foreign organisms, which identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly deactivate them.
Based on this, plasma of blood collected from a group of recovered COVID-19 patients was administered to 10 patients in high-risk condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and the burden of inflammation and pathogenesis decreased, and the concentration of bioflavonoids in the blood improved.
However, as specific treatments are yet to be developed, there is a need for confirmation and clarification before proposing the system on a large scale.
In addition, although there are therapeutic effects, there are some side effects associated with plasma that should be carefully considered.
For example, other antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and produce a cytokine-releasing symptom, which can become a life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma to treat life-threatening patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and manufacture specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global pandemic.
Thus, extracting B-cells from cured patients is more necessary and practical, and detecting the genetic markers of beneficial antibodies or antibodies that act against the essential proteins of the pathogen.
In this way, we can immediately increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments.
However, the effects depend on the combination of different components of a formula, which may vary depending on the diagnosis based on the principles of the TCM.
Most of the elements that can be useful are unknown or unclear because such elements or their optimal combinations are difficult to isolate and confirm.
Currently, as there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, DCM is the main alternative therapy for patients with moderate to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe conditions.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Tu capsules and Lian Hua Xing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In China, several provinces, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), reported high recovery rates, with TCMM being used on 87% of COVID-19 patients, while Hubei Province had the lowest recovery rate (13%) with TCMM being used on approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients.
However, this is a very approximate comparison as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease need to be considered in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Puli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicines (WM) treatment alone and the combination of DCM with WM.
They found that the time required for temperature recovery, symptomatic disappearance, and time for hospitalization was less for the group given traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine than the group taking only Western medicine.
Most strikingly, the rate of symptom exacerbation (severe from the site) is significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%). Also, the mortality rate is lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCMs will have to wait for large scale and more centralised studies in well-controlled environments.
It is also interesting to elaborate on the mechanistic properties of the activities and explain the beneficial components of the DCM treatments or, if possible, their combinations.
Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 will often experience great fear of highly contagious or even fatal diseases, and isolated people will experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Additional depression and depression can be caused by the development of infectious symptoms such as fever, oxygen deprivation, cough, and by adverse effects such as insomnia from cardiac stimulants taken during treatment.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there were reports of a wide range of mental health effects, including chronic depression, panic, panic, psychotic shock, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health measures taken in response to the spread of COVID-19, may subject people to further anxiety and guilt regarding the effects of the infection, isolation and harm to their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases and people in contact with them, and the general public in need.
Psychological support should include clear exchanges with multidisciplinary mental health teams, continuous and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and treatment plans, and use of professional electronic tools and apps to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to disrupt the chain of animal stagnation and human-to-human transmission of infection, and antimicrobial therapy is needed to control infectious disease caused by emerging pathogens.
Efforts are underway to develop S protein based vaccines that provide long-term and inactivating antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
The vaccine that eliminated direct exposure to SARS has been evaluated on animal models.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in elderly and dying specimens and their safety against animal-derived infections is yet to be determined before clinical studies can begin.
This is because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new outbreaks have occurred since.
Conversely, MERS continues to occur in the Middle East in groups and groups, and spreads to other areas because of the presence of animals in affected areas.
Vaccine strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated pathogens, DNA plasmids, microparticles, nanoparticles, pathogen-like particles and clonal protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task in controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, the long time required to develop the vaccine (average 18 months) and the structural variations of the coronaviruses make overcoming the difficulty a challenge.
As a brand new disease, COVID-19 has just started its full clinical course with thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without consequences.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is likely to cause higher morbidity and mortality rates in severely affected patients.
Therefore, developing a disease prediction model is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on the clinical studies recorded so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in predicting SARS recovery, and the same is true in COVID-19.
As described above, in a study of 8,866 infected individuals, COVID-19 was found to be prevalent in 47.7% of those aged 30-65 years and above 50 years.
Patients requiring intensive care already had both diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those not requiring such treatment (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age was a factor in making a prognosis for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 is more prevalent in males (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000) than in females.
Two Diseases and Problems: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care may suffer from severe heart failure and blood malnutrition.
Heart attacks have been the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is associated with positive cholangiocytes and therefore causes liver disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It is also worth noting that there is a strong correlation between age and chronic disease and that they may overlap.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of tissue damage or tissue damage. It is also proposed as a predictor of disease, response to treatment and ultimately cure.
The correlation between CRP level and severity of COVID-19 and prognosis for recovery is proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LHD), aspartate amino transducer (AST), alanine amino transducer (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may help predict results.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Thus, they are the traditional indicators of heart or liver disease.
Key clinical signs: Temporary improvement of breast radiography and clinical signs should be considered along with other issues of prediction of effects and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used as adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage during infectious diseases.
Since the widespread use of high doses of protein pyrethrins in severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from impaired longevity and poor quality of life with bloodless bone tissue destruction.
Thus, if necessary, short-term steroid use should be recommended for COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients are experiencing unusual stress due to long-term isolation and severe instability and having witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential that these patients recover from the mental freeze and return to normal life with psychological counselling and long-term support.
The demographic studies so far have shown that the pathology of COVID-19 is different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 also multiplies in the respiratory tract and in the gastrointestinal tract with great efficiency, and in the early stages of infection, like other cold-causing coronaviruses, it multiplies in the body with little or no symptoms.
Thus, infected patients may produce high levels of the pathogen during daily activities in the early stages or in the intervals between the onset of symptoms, making it difficult to control the spread of the disease.
However, most transmission is not early, and SARS-CoV transmission was considered to occur when patients are severely impaired.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more moderate and more difficult to contain than the SARS outbreak.
In the hope of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, significant efforts have been made in Wuhan and surrounding cities, including a general lockdown and quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these activities are seriously damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is contained.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the decline period will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which is more transmissible than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini and others set up a model to predict the effects of the pandemic and suggested that two-thirds of the world's population would be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
A Canadian team has reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the mid-brain and throat glands of patients who have recovered from the illness and have been discharged from the hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may be circulating in a similar manner to the flu.
However, in terms of the declining number of new cases, there are encouraging signs in China, indicating that the current strategies are paying off.
Ebola was initially projected to infect one million people and kill half a million.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control somewhat.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to become less virulent and become extinct or even a pathogen with a low prevalence in humans.
A comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is most likely to be transmitted through coughing and sneezing, and there is a possibility of transmission through direct contact with infected objects.
The virus has also been detected in the faeces, which has raised new possibilities of oral transmission from the faeces.
A recent study of 138 infected persons showed that 41% of the cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers, may have been infected by hospital disinfection.
Thus, better precautions should be taken to protect human beings, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, peers and patients and even those who stand by infected people.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks, and the use of both surgical masks and N.95 respirators (Series# 1860S) can help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks avoid fluid droplets in an environment where pathogens can travel through the air from an infected person or stick to the surface of objects and be transmitted from there to others.
However, only N.95 (series # 1860S) masks protect against inhalation of mature pathogens of 10 to 80 mm size, of which only 5% mature pathogens can penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV, both at approximately 85 nm.
As particles will travel through the five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N-95 (series# 1860S) masks instead of surgical masks.
Even with masks, health-care providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce contact with the virus.
The bacteria can also be transmitted through the eyes of individuals.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor, even though wearing an N.95 mask, was infected with SARS-CoV-2 which may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Thus, healthcare providers should also wear protective masks or goggles when working with patients.
It is strongly recommended that all the general public in affected or potentially affected areas take measures such as washing their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, self-isolation and trying to stay indoors and minimise contact with individuals who may be infected.
Three feet is considered as the appropriate distance from the patient to ensure the safety of the public.
These activities are effective mechanisms to reduce the risk of infection while preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has entered the human world as a new virus, its superstructural similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have created a high level of concern in China based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan CDC had been reassuring citizens that the new virus is less contagious and will spread from humans to humans at scale, and that prevention and control of the disease is not an issue.
The news eased public awareness, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, when Wuhan missed a crucial time to minimise the spread of the disease.
Disease control agencies in China can take these difficult lessons and make important improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when issuing public notices as every word is taken into account by the citizens and can change their mindset and conclusions; (2) act with extra sensitivity and promptness to unusual information coming from hospitals without waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) seek to contain the epidemic at an early stage with extra control, rather than trying to provide public comfort; and, (4) provide periodic specific and fruitful trainings to increase public awareness of the epidemic and to test and improve the social bullying system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide.
The virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and the resistant SARS, which has created a sense of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to control the spread of measles and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than younger individuals, men more than women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate among older individuals than among younger individuals.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus without symptoms, while SARS patients only transmit the virus if they are seriously ill, making it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the usual RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2 have shown negative results.
On the other hand, if we test the cured patients, we can find out if they are infected again.
These discoveries could dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid advances in COVID-19 research, several key issues remain unresolved, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic consensus has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses, we still cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 originated from the same strains.
What intermediate species caused the virus to spread from the original animal algae to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and #2, we can't effectively stop the spread, and it can start again at any time.
Molecular models and biochemical evaluations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how does the virus enter the airway molecules and undergo the subsequent pathological changes?
Does the pathogen bind to other ACE-2-releasing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does a virus genetically change when it spreads from one person to another?
Will it be a global pandemic, disappearing like SARS, or recurring like the flu?
This is necessary, but it takes a little more time to answer all of the above and many more questions.
However, at whatever cost, we have no choice but to stop the spread of this pandemic as quickly as possible and return to our normal lives.
Animal origin of the human coronavirus (HCoV)
For thousands of years, co-evolution, mutation and adaptation of coronaviruses and their vectors, including humans, has been driven by the evolution of the virus.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to be capable of causing mild illness such as the common cold.
The severe outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown how devastating and life-threatening the human coronavirus infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has re-attracted attention to the coronavirus and has surprised us with its high transmissibility but at the same time low morbidity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus infection is of animal origin and it is useful for us to understand the animal origin of the human coronavirus (HCoV).
Most human coronaviruses originated from owls, which do not cause disease.
Intermediate stack parasites of some human coronaviruses have also been identified.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for preventing disease in humans.
Studying the coronavirus-molluscum interactions in animals may provide important insights into the transmission of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current knowledge on seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs), focusing on the history of their discovery and their zoological origin and inter-species transmission.
Essentially, we are comparing different human coronaviruses (HCoVs) from the perspective of evolution and genomic recombination of the pathogen.
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being discussed in this round.
In addition, the requirements for successful mutations and the implications of pathogenic evolution on disease severity are pointed out.
Coronaviruses belong to the family of 'coronavirus' which includes a group of cold, positive-energy, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The most massive of the RNA viruses, with a genome size of 26 to 32 kilobases, were called coronaviruses because of their crown-like shape when viewed under an electron microscope.
Structurally, coronaviruses have undivided lineages that share a similar structure.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large, overlapping open reading frames (ORF1A and ORF1B) that are translated into replicas, BPA1A and BPA1A.
These variants are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, denoted NSP 1-16 (see below).
The rest of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins including the spindle (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
The unique sub-proteins of each gene are encoded by different genetic origins of the coronavirus.
Based on sequence differences, coronaviruses are classified into four (alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus, and delta-coronavirus), of which the beta-coronavirus variants contain the majority of human coronaviruses, and are further divided into four genetic pathways (A, B, C, and D).
Paleogenetic evidence shows that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source of most alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus, while birds are the primary source of gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have been continuously breaking through the barriers of species, and some of them have evolved into important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus variants have been identified.
Among them, human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus NL63 are the alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronavirus include human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are the most infectious, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections, which are more prevalent in patients with relatively severe respiratory tract disease syndrome (ARDS) and patients with non-pulmonary symptoms.
The first human coronavirus-229E strain, B814, was extracted from nasal discharge of people with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been collected on human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), both of which cause self-limiting symptoms, through extensive studies.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was widely accepted that infection by human coronaviruses was generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, affecting more than 8,000 people and claiming about 10% of the population's lives.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a series of epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula, and it spread widely to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has killed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are of animal origin, either from buffalo, rat or domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolution of all human coronavirus (HCoVs) from bats, in which the pathogens are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show considerable genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented tremendous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
The zoological origin of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) provides a framework to understand the factors that control natural history, propulsion and transmission across species.
This could guide or facilitate the search for the host, intermediate and breeding animal host of SARS-CoV-2 with important implications for preventing future spread.
In this review, we present an overview of the zoological origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent pathogens of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are generally non-pathogenic in their natural host, but become pathogenic in new hosts after interspecies transmission.
We are also reviewing the evolutionary trend of the human coronavirus (HCoV), which shows that increased transmission leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is being discussed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the isolation of human coronavirus strain B814 from the nasal mucus of patients with normal influenza, different coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last decades, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) was isolated from the respiratory tract of upper respiratory tract infection patients in 1966, and later adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell sequences.
Typical cold symptoms in patients infected with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) include headache, nausea, nausea and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10 ~ 20% of infections.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was isolated from organ culture and pathways in the brains of mice.
The epidemiological features of human coronavirus - OC43 (HCoV-OC43) are similar to those of human coronavirus - 229E (HCoV-229E), which are indistinguishable from infection by symptoms with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
Both human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) are globally prevalent and are transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, for these two pathogens, the time interval between onset of symptoms is less than a week, followed by a period of about 2 weeks.
In a study of human volunteers, healthy subjects infected with human coronavirus 229E developed moderate normal saliva.
Only a few immunocompromised patients were found to have severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "uncommon pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV-infection and SARS-CoV pathogen in human history, and the third HCoV detection.
The first SARS case was detected in Guangdong province, China, in late 2002.
The SARS pandemic has recorded 8,096 infections with 774 deaths, and has spread to several countries and continents.
Except for super-transmissions, each infection is estimated to lead to approximately two secondary infections, with a time interval of 4 to 7 days between onset of symptoms and the peak of the virus on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have muscular pain, headache, fever, malaise and colds followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests and high levels of creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of sarcoma.
SARS patients have been shown to have extensive respiratory damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney may also be affected by these severe infections, usually accompanied by a cytokine cycle, which can be particularly dangerous for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient from Indeks Hospital who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to the research of human coronaviruses.
Human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The most common infections caused by human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) are cholera, meningitis, fever and bronchitis.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same pathogen from a nasal sample of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was only identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses are caused by human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and its peak incidence occurs in summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is associated with ankylosing spondylitis, also known as ankylosing spondylitis.
In the same year, human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, human coronavirus -HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is thought to be associated with an increase in severe asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was detected globally, causing mild respiratory illnesses.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are also highly adaptive to humans, and are generally less likely to cause serious infectious diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons, such as the rare occurrence of a more serious subtype of the human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63), which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when these human coronaviruses (HCoVs) gain the ability to spread effectively and persist in humans, they become less severe or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed infections originated in the Middle East, cases with secondary spread, occasionally resulting from close contact from outside, have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
South Korea had another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by progressive severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients infected with MERS also developed severe renal failure, which is unique to MERS so far in human coronavirus-causing diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed infections have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive pathogens known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as an international public health emergency of concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 infections have been confirmed globally, with a severe infectious mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, Hubei, China has a 4.2% death rate, while outside it there is only a 1.2% death rate.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections including fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Some patients have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms, and it can quickly progress to severe respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster into different branches on the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been reports of patients being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection without symptoms, which could be a factor in the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveals similarities and differences between them.
First, the time interval between the onset of symptoms and the duration of human coronavirus infection is the same.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the common path of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features commonly seen during community-acquired human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, including significantly low, moderate or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small proportion of those severely affected by COVID-19 are also found to be similar to SARS-CoV infection, although at a slightly lower rate.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 shows characteristics of both the community acquired human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and the interesting strains of SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, the re-structuring of SARS-CoV-2 from humans should be checked to ensure that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Future studies will clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 has a role in the same way as SARS-CoV-2 has, at least in some circumstances.
It is very interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 will manifest itself as well as the human coronavirus (HCoV) cases that have spread in the community.
Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmission, pathogenicity and sustained transmission after it has entered the body of humans, will influence the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four HCoVs acquired by the mildly symptomatic community are well-suited to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have lived well with these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient human coronavirus pandemic.
Serious disease-causing HCoVs have been eliminated in humans and in humans that have developed severe HCoVs.
To do this, the human coronavirus (HCoV) must replicate in sufficient quantities in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive genetic mutations that resist vertebrate regulators.
In this way, SARS-CoV-2 infection has a high probability of becoming fully compatible with humans when it persists and affects more people.
If it adapts itself to the environment, it is difficult to stop the spread to humans by isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four coronaviruses acquired by society have spread through the human population, triggering a normal cold in immunocompromised humans.
These pathogens do not need animal host organisms.
Conversely, the highly virulent pathogens SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and therefore cannot extend their transmission within humans.
They must survive and reproduce in their animal pathways and have the opportunity to travel to vulnerable human targets, perhaps by walking through one or more intermediate and multiplying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in the community.
At least in the current context, it is as transmissible as the social-associated HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
We need to see if it can be fully adapted to humans or spread to humans without intermediate animal spider veins.
Before discussing the animal origin of human coronaviruses, it is useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, nature, intermediation and multiplication of hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal that has a closely related ancestor that shares high similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence acts as an evolutionary host of an HCoV.
The ancestral virus usually adapts to the host and is pathogenic to the host.
Similarly, the host parasites retain the human coronavirus continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the spiders are naturally infected and are natural spiders of the human coronavirus or its parent pathogen.
Conversely, if HCoV is introduced before or around the introduction of a new intermediate host to humans, it does not fit well with the new host and often causes disease.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and can multiply the host by allowing the virus to replicate non-stop, then transmit it to humans to multiply the human infection.
If an HCoV virus cannot sustain its spread in an intermediate host, it will subject itself to end-stage infection.
Conversely, HCoVs can mutate with an intermediate host and also develop long-term infection.
In this, the intermediate spider becomes a natural storage spider.
Backward epidemiological data revealed that SARS had a history of contact with game animals, the first known infectious disease.
A subsequent epidemiological study indicated that animal traders had higher levels of SARS-CoV antibody protein compared to the general population.
Mascudo palm-footed cats (Phaguma larvata) and raccoon dogs were the first known carriers of SARS-CoV-like pathogens in live animal markets.
Indirect evidence is that no further SARS infections have been reported since the killing of all the mushrooms in the markets.
However, masked palm-leaf cats from forest or farms without contact with live animal markets have been reported to be mostly negative for SARS-CoV. These masked palm-leaf cats may only act as intermediate multiplier hosts, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS.
In particular, since various animals in markets in Guangzhou contain 80% anti-SARS-coronavirus antibodies, it cannot be denied that many species of small mammals may have also acted as intermediate multiplying hosts of the SARS-coronavirus.
These all appear to be end-stage hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The search for natural animal reptiles of the SARS coronavirus revealed a closely related SARS-related Rhinoelopus wawl coronavirus known as SARS-RH-Wawl Coronavirus HKU3 (SARS-RH-Wawl Coronavirus HKU3) in Chinese equine bats.
These bats have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and are positive for the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
It and other WoW coronaviruses have 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the groundwork for the new idea that bats carry the emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none other than a unique WIV1 can be isolated as a living pathogen.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1, derived from a mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse mouse
Interestingly, the saliva of terminated SARS patients is capable of neutralizing WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the citric acid sequence similarity.
Despite the high similarity between the two pathogens, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent pathogen of SARS-CoV and that bats are not immediate accumulators of SARS-CoV.
Genealogical analysis groups suggest that MERS-CoV is identical to the same group as the swallow CoV-HKU4 and the bat CoV-HKU5.
Both the coronavirus - HK4 and MERS-CoV use the same vertebrate receptor, diptide-polypeptidase 4 (DPP4), for pathogenic entry.
The woolly beta-coronaviruses identified from Europe and Africa are genetically related to the RNA-related RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative, the WoWal coronavirus-HKU25, share only 87% of the same acid sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate buffer for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that camels of Middle Eastern origin, like camels in several African countries, are photogenic to MERS-CoV-specific neutralising immunosuppressants.
A live MERS-CoV isoform similar to the human one has been isolated from the nasal cavity of camels, suggesting that camels act as true host hosts of MERS-CoV.
Camels tested positive for MERS-CoV generally showed moderate symptoms but a high incidence of infection.
Infected camels spread the pathogens not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is the main route of pathogenicity in bats.
However, as many confirmed outbreaks of MERS have no history of contact with camels before symptomatic onset, human-to-human transmission or unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV are reported to be associated with unknown modes of transmission.
SARS-CoV-2 and Rhinolopus affinis buffalo have been isolated and share 96.2% nitric acid similarity with RADG13.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is good enough to cause parental relationship.
That is, until near-identical waves of coronaviruses are found in the future, waves cannot be immediate acquirers of SARS-CoV-2.
Indirectly, the wildlife species sold and killed at Huan's seafood wholesale market must have had intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with which many of the early cases of COVID-19 were associated, making it an animal-to-human transmissible event.
Several recent studies based on genomic sequencing have suggested that a group of dangerous small mammals known as antelopes (Manis javanica) may also have SARS-CoV-2-related ancestral beta-coronaviruses.
The novel ant coronavirus genes share 85-92% of the nucleic acid sequence structure with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RADG13 with a level of about 90% identification of the utric acid sequence.
They belong to two subfamilies of SARS-CoV-2-like pathogens in the genome, one of which shares a highly similar receptor binding domain (RPD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are highly differentiated, albeit at genome-wide levels with a high degree of sequence similarity.
A previous study on infected ants reported the detection of pathogenic contagion from lung samples, which is associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different combinations of methods and genome sequencing to produce a partial genome sequence containing approximately 86.3% of the full-length pathogenome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that one of the animal intermediates of SARS-CoV-2 is pangolin.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct ant-CoV origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and ant-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Further, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and ant-corona related beta-coronaviruses.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is to be established in bats, ants and other mammals.
The highest sequence similarity has been found in RPDs between SARS-CoV-2 and ant, with SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 sharing the highest sequence similarity at the genetic level.
It is a good guess that the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronavirus of ant-dentists and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective mediated convergent evolution.
A third wild animal species, the ant, has a counter-example for recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RaTG13.
As a driving force in evolution, the re-mating phenomenon between beta-coronaviruses is widespread.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been included in the arbitration.
In addition to the highly virulent human coronaviruses, animal pathogenesis of human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronaviruses HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) has been studied.
Genetic evidence indicated that both human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus -229E (HCoV-229E) may have originated from the WoWV coronavirus, while the parent pathogens of human coronavirus -OC43 and human coronavirus -HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) have been identified in rodents.
A new type of Appalachian Ridge coronavirus, known as Appalachian Ridge Coronavirus 2, has been identified in the North American Tricolor Woolly and has been reported to be closely related to human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is genetically related to another cowboy coronavirus known as Hipposideros/Canagvam/19/2008 that was detected in Ghana, while camels are suspected to be its intermediate vector.
For clarity, current details on the zoological origin of known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Genome analysis has provided evidence for the interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses throughout history.
In 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded when human coronavirus - OC43 (HCoV-OC43) species passed from domestic animals to humans.
The history of interspecies transmission of human coronavirus 229E is unclear.
Waveal alpha-coronaviruses have been identified that are closely related to human coronavirus-229E.
Among them is the alpha-corona virus.
Several sources demonstrate direct transmission from the buffalo to humans.
First, it is humans, not apes, who may have interacted with the woolly bears in a shared environment.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with ape-like creatures.
Second, the human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) related waves alpha-coronaviruses are differentiated and non-pathogenic in waves, while the alpha-coronaviruses of Alpaca caused respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-corona virus has not been detected in wildlife.
Thus, the possibility of alpacas acquiring the human-related alpha-coronavirus HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit the human coronavirus 229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoVs act as gene banks for HCoV-229E, and alpacas and dromedary camels may act as intermediate hosts for transmitting viruses to humans, much like MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of transmission from bats to monotypes and from monotypes to humans and across species.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats has been known since it was first identified, and has been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that algae serve as a convenient storage bank for viral species for gene-splitting and animal-spreading exchanges.
Longevity, dense groups, close social contact and strong ability to fly are favorable conditions for bats to be an effective 'pathogen-spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into camels in isolation for decades.
This virus has adapted well to camels, transforming camels from an intermediate host to a stable and natural caching host.
The MERS-coronavirus is very moderately pathogenic and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its dissemination to humans is an accident, as humans are the end-stage hosts of MERS-CoV, unable to sustain its spread.
If there is any role of ants in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it would be different than the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV.
In particular, the ant-beta-corona virus is highly pathogenic in ants.
As with the case of SARS-CoV, fungi may be end-stage hosts for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronavirus.
Several possibilities for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be demonstrated or disproved in future studies.
First, bats may be a stack of SARS-CoV-2-related pathogens, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological privacy with bats through the coal or coal mine.
Second, ants may be one of the newly introduced intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related pathogens.
Humans are trying to catch the virus by eating the flesh of wild and prey animals.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Analysis on domestic and wild animals for other antibodies is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the reversibility and compatibility of SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a third species that interacted with bats and ants.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from various animal hosts, three major factors on the pathogenic side enable the coronaviruses to cross the barriers.
First, their relatively high rates of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-isolated RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average mutation rate of approximately 4 out of 10 per year per site, which may vary for novel hosts depending on the stage of the CoV.
The coronaviruses have error-sensing exoribonucleases, and removal of these results in a high degree of mutation and inactivity or inactivity.
Interestingly, the urea analogue remdesivir is known to suppress the spread of the coronavirus by blocking exorbo-resistant and RNA-resistant RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is one of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to be tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are a million times higher than those of their vertebrates.
Additionally, mutation rates are often higher when human coronavirus (HCoV) does not match well with the ompyroid.
Compared to the highly mutagenic SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a markedly lower mutagenicity, indicating greater adaptation in humans.
Indirectly, it has already been adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition, this applies not only to SARS-CoV-2, but also to the single-cell camel-adapted MERS-CoV.
In theory, the genes, vaccines and antimicrobials against SARS-CoV-2 would be ineffective.
Second, the large RNA in CoVs induces extra plasticity in the gene mutation and rearrangement, thereby increasing the probability of co-evolution of the gaps, which is favorable for novel CoVs to appear when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by a number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded toward the 3′ end of the gene.
Third, through a unique replication-selection technique, the coronaviruses change their patterns randomly and frequently during RNA replication.
In the mixing vessel host, strand switching occurs frequently during transcription of the COVID RNA.
Highly synchronized full-length and subcellular RNAs may cross-link to form novel coronaviruses.
Genetic evidence of natural rearrangement is found in both human coronaviruses-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and human coronaviruses-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), as well as animal coronaviruses such as SARS-like coronaviruses and batCoV-HKU9 (batCoV-HKU9).
Bacterial-antimicrobial interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three pathogens mentioned above, pathogenic interaction with the vertebrate receptor is another important factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the crossover of SARS-CoV is considered a significant example, revealing evidence for positive selection during cross-species transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates of human and cat SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoVs undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the receptor of the S protein and is actively selected by the response of the host immune system.
In SARS-CoV, RPD is present in the 318th to 510th amino acids in the S1 strand, binding to human ACE2 and its central receptors for pathogen penetration.
The RPD of SARS-CoV is capable of sensing ACE2 receptors of various animals including the owls, wasps, rats and raccoons, thus allowing for cross-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to differentiate from human and civet pathogenic extracts in RPD, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding property of interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
CIVET SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which increase the association of the spike protein's interactions with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid alternatives are likely to be critical for the pathogen to adapt to humans.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a receptor with SARS-CoV, which is also a host to the same organism.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggests that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ACE2 at the S1 unit of the S protein may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study suggests a 10 to 20 times greater association in this bond than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-receptor is required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Ironically, the human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63) binds to ACE2, but with a variant of S.
There are several human coronaviruses receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for human coronavirus-229E and 9-O-acetyl silic acid for human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43).
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after the domestication of their animal hosts.
The effect of cell receptors on human coronavirus (HCoV) transmission is also managed by other amphibian-dependent and control factors.
The difference in these amphibian proteins between humans and the natural hosts of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) such as voles, unicorns and rodents may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human coronavirus (HCoV) should capture pro-venom factors and reduce the pro-venom control factors for successful inter-species transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this critical area of bacterial-molecular interactions will be identified and classified.
The CRISPR will be used to conduct a neutral genome-wide assay of amniocentesis and control factors for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art technology.
Exposure of novel human coronavirus (HCoV): back to the drawing board
The novel diversity of the coronavirus provides a wealth of possibilities for the formation of the human coronavirus (HCoV).
In this regard, the Vaval CoVs act as the gene bank of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and recombination are driving the evolution of the human coronavirus (HCoV), and serve as two critical stages of this activity.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter pathogenic appearance.
Among SARS-CoV sub-proteins, adaptation of ORF8 to humans is thought to be important, as SARS-CoV-related waves encode different ORF8 proteins even when isolated.
The 29-nucleotide-deleting property of SARS-CoVs is that an isolated strain was detected early in the human pandemic.
This deletion cuts ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptation gene mutation that promotes mutation of the host.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a history of re-fusion with the genetic lineages of alpha and gamma coronaviruses, in which numerous small re-fusion sites were identified in the RNA-related RNA polymerases.
Reconstruction sites were identified in most of nsp9, nsp10 and also in parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the outbreak of MERS-CoV is known to be a cross-breeding of different strains, which has occurred in monotremes in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re-fusion events have been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses (HCoVs) combine with other animal coronaviruses (CoVs) with their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unexpected changes in the pathogenesis, often by relieving pathogens of selection pressures such as the immune system of the host.
An example of these effects is the loss of full length ORF4 in human coronavirus strain 229E due to two-nucleic acid de-acidification.
Since non-invasive ORF4 is found in the human coronavirus-229E-associated whey and camel pathogens, the alpha-corona virus shows monoclonal acid insertion, resulting in a metamorphosis.
Finally, the evolution of the novel human coronavirus (HCoV) is driven by selective stress in their host host host.
Asymptomatic or moderate symptoms were observed when bats were infected with coronaviruses, indicating mutual compatibility between coronaviruses and bats.
Bats appear to be anatomically and physiologically well adapted to the coronavirus.
For example, deficiencies in the activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce pro-inflammatory responses by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the anti-reactivation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and this is due to the low exposure level of class I molecules containing the major toxic polymers.
Furthermore, high-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from the high metabolism of bats suppress the replication of the coronavirus and impair the checking by exorbitant means, thus providing pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic mutations when introduced into a new host.
Rearrangement may lead to the formation of highly pathogenic coronaviral mutations, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for vertebrate adaptation.
So, the emergence of three novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in the last two decades is not a coincidence.
The coronaviruses are non-infectious or cause moderate symptoms in their host hosts, bats and camels.
They replicate aggressively without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here are the secrets of why asymptomatic pathogens are seen and what causes severe infections in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by stimulation of the immune response and cytokine cycles, in which if the immune response is strong, lung damage is more severe.
In contrast, in asymptomatic cases, the immune response has been removed from the coronavirus response.
The same tactic of suppressing the immune response may be beneficial in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The antibacterial response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, injection of type I interferon in humans at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be beneficial.
In addition, inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in bats is deficient.
Through this reasoning, it was found that the inhibition of NLRP3 influenza with MCC950 is effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common theme of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-cov has been detected, the coronavirus also has a wavelength that shares 96% nucleotide structure similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
Penguin cats and other animals in markets have been found to carry pathogens similar to SARS-CoV, however no immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Ant beta-coronaviruses have been identified that are similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that ant beta-coronaviruses may act as intermediate hosts or contribute genome fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
The coronavirus has come back to the forefront in the wake of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has significantly changed our view of the zoonotic origin in human transmission and the importance of animal deposits of human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
There is extensive evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in the bovine and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
If SARS-CoV infection originates from interactions between humans and fungi in the market, closing meat markets and killing fungi could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Given the finding of multiple genetic traits of ant beta-coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and for the same reason, ant mites should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by ants and other mammals is to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been coming from isolated camels for decades.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent further transmission of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be developed to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these pathogens, new strains may emerge and cause serious disease.
A variety of zoonotically transmitted infectious CoVs are circulating.
In particular, the animal-transmitted virus is highly diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, resulting in new coronaviruses that may become more transmissible and/or dangerous to humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the wild animal-eating culture in some parts of China must be abandoned.
Along with testing for SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a well-prepared response plan.
In fact, many pathogens have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many advantages in spreading pathogens, if humans are knowledgeable about this, they can reduce the chance of contact with the buffalo and other wildlife species.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which can be effective in preventing transmission from animals to humans and possible future infections.
Finally, the best way to prevent the animal-borne spread of the virus is for humans to stay away from the natural habitat of animal-borne pathogens.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be discovered.
First, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and ants share the same ecological significance if bats transmit the ancestral pathogen of SARS-CoV-2 to ants.
Second, if bats are more directly involved in human transmission, we need to find out how humans interact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is a true intermediate vertebrate, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with various organisms, including humans, bats and rodents.
Finally, both surveillance and testing should be carried out as many mammals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
If it is a wasp, an ant or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent pathogen may be identified in its natural host in the future.
Continuing reviews in this area clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 suspicious case and confirmed case.
On February 6, 2020, our team released a Rapid Consultation Guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guidance provided our experience and developed a better reference for fighting this pandemic globally.
Please note that COVID-19 2019 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing through ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience, and therefore, the strategies and treatments for detecting the disease are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment in our guidance and provided new diagnostic guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for 'suspicious case' and 'confirmed case' as per the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, which is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus is also named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 pandemic as a pandemic.
Our team has developed a Rapid Instruction Guideline for fighting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and it has been published on the website of the Army Medical Review on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing through the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience, and therefore, the strategies and treatments for detecting infection are constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China's Code of Conduct for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 infection (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, contains seven versions, some of which have significantly changed circumstances.
Now, in response to our guidance, Sue and others have introduced a simple assessment program based on their medical experience.
Their work has added a new source to our guidance and is the best data available to the world on the pandemic.
We acknowledge and express our gratitude for their remarkable work.
However, their work should be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment protocols (Revised Seventh Edition) and latest studies for COVID-19 infection.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), it must either be combined with two items of clinical exposure for conducting an all-inclusive analysis of the pathogenic elements to confirm infection, or, in the absence of clear epidemiological history, it must satisfy three items of clinical exposure.
History of onset: (1) Travel or residence in Wuhan and its surroundings or other community areas where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days prior to onset; (2) Contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected persons (confirmed by acid test); (3) Wuhan and its surroundings or other community areas with flu and respiratory problems in the last 14 days prior to onset; (4) (Housing, school, school, etc. with a small area of infection/fever and 2 confirmed infections with high levels of infection and 2 confirmed infections with high levels of infection).
Clinical manifestations: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the appearance of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or low overall white blood cell count or decreased vascular count at the initial stage of transmission.
The detection of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any pathogenic or serological evidence, including: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high integrity to known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for IgM antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgG antibody in serum testing; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody conversion from negative to positive or at the recovery stage of acute phase with ≥4 fold increase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for the presence of urea in respiratory tract or blood samples has been included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenicity in blood samples has been included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, followed by non-viral evidence in the seventh edition.
These researcher-based changes continued the work of finding the optimal nucleic acid detection tool for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples, and supported the delivery of a specific antibody positive result in confirmed criteria.
Besides, we have more evidence to be cautious with variant and asymptomatic patients.
"Therefore, the policy of Sue and others to classify as 'low risk' individuals without clinical symptoms needs to be updated".
We need to review the scoring system in clinical practice and studies.
Finally, we hope more direct evidence will emerge, and we invite readers to comment.
"We recommend that the new guidelines imposed in their respective countries be identified and followed for screening between 'suspected persons' and 'confirmed persons'".
Our team will update our guidelines for assistance from time to time.
Bangladesh has recorded five new COVID-19 deaths in one day, the highest number of daily deaths.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the number of cases registered by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh includes 114 cases and 33 cases of recovery.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online press conference, IETCR Director Dr Mirjadhi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman died in the accident.
According to Dr. Mirjadhi, two people were over 60 years old, two people were between 51 and 60, and one was 41-50 years old.
He said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March, and the pandemic is expected to spread to the rest of the world.
A hospital official told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saipour Rahman, director of the Anti-Corruption Commission of Bengal, who was being treated at Kuwait Maidri Hospital.
In a live video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Obaydul Quader shared the information that public transport will be suspended for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
The public transport shutdown was initially scheduled to start on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
The movement of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - is still allowed.
On 8th March, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were registered in two men who had returned from Italy and the spouse of one of them.
As of March 19, the three have already returned.
SARS-CoV-2 has over a million infections globally
The total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections globally has surpassed one million on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths are due to COVID-19.
The milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection, meaning Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization recorded 1,051,635 confirmed infections, including 79,332 new cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10 a.m. on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases have been reported in the United States, which are linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
Citing data from Johns Hopkins University, CBS News reported that more than 1,000 deaths from the coronavirus in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world announced drastic measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced that the city's closure had been extended until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will be paid without going to work until April 30.
A referendum was held in the Portuguese Parliament to extend the state of emergency for 15 days, and the law was passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a day, after previously only extending from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dwayne has announced that the stay-at-home order has been extended until May 1.
Stores in Australia are reducing the amount of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles introduced purchase restrictions at two and one pack per transaction, respectively, at all of their stores nationwide.
The ALDI introduced a one-pack-only definition on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as news on the outlets and on the chains' Facebook pages.
Consumers are known to be buying goods due to fear of COVID-19 as people self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one parcel per pound.
The changes follow the previous four-packets-per-transaction rate introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In its March 8 press release, Coles said that as the four-package restriction is in place, "many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery", describing the request as "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unprecedented".
"A Woolworths spokesman said sales had risen ""significantly"" last week".
Costco's Canberra store last week also restricted the allowable amount to two packages.
To further mitigate the shortage, Coles not only dispatched large packages from suppliers but also increased delivery times. Woolworths dispatched additional stocks while preparing stocks for the planned ALDI Wednesday special sale.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that when retailers try to build up stocks, the restrictions imposed by the local council on the delivery time of the goods make it difficult.
He expects production costs to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, with critical raw materials in short supply.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores would not be able to operate the special Wednesday following the earlier release of inventory.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are filling up stocks every night.
He said that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, which leads to limited stocks, and then when we see that after everything is sold, the vast shelves are all empty, the feeling of scarcity is further reinforced.
"Coles and Woolworths have the idea that if there are lots of things on the shelf, like toilet paper and detergent, [that can be] bought, there's a lot of room to reduce the risk of unnecessary fear", Russell Zimmerman told ABC News in an interview.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crab said they were running out of stock last Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes CleanEx toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, say they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, News.com.au reported.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some property sellers offered to give free toilet paper to bidders at the first auction in Melbourne, where only a small number of bids were held because buyers were off during the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of the Darwin daily ND News, which was cut and included an eight-page insert for toilet paper, was published in the same month.
According to a press release issued by ABC Australia on 3 March, shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions and said they had no plans to introduce any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said there is also a high demand for other items including masks, disinfectants, dryers, hand washes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Sunday evening events limited the UK supermarket Okado Andres to two 12-roll packs of toilet paper.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to be a pandemic.
"While the term 'pandemic' refers to how widespread a disease is, not how dangerous specific diseases are, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stressed the need to urge governments to act:"
"All countries can still change the course of the pandemic".
"Countries need to find, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their people", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"The spread and severity of the outbreak, and the risk of inaction, are of great concern".
According to Dr. Tom Freeden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a February CNN note, he said, 'No other respiratory pathogens, other than influenza, have been tracked from the onset to the series of international outbreaks.'
"Gebrejus expressed a similar view, saying, ""We have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus before"."
He said, "We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time".
The pandemic was given a new status of plague following the decision by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January to declare it a public health emergency of international concern.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""Basically, it's going to get worse"."
As of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide was 126,000 and 4,600 deaths resulted, the Associated Press reported.
2019-20 Coronavirus is the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the currently active acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. It was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 infections have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Almost 364,000 people have recovered.
The global mortality rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand, compared to 4% in China.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The time from infection to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can be two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antimicrobial treatment.
Initial treatment is symptomatic and tolerant. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from others, monitoring, and self-isolation from persons suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and workplace closures.
The pandemic has led to extreme international socio-economic disruptions, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages due to tense buying and hoarding.
Schools and universities are closed nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people from East and Southeast Asian regions and those with similar origins, and people from other areas with significant levels of virus exposure.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced by reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries.
On December 31, 2019, several people suffered from diarrhea without knowing the cause, and an investigation into the cause began in early January 2020, according to health officials in Wuhan, China.
These cases were mostly in contact with the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the pathogen is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly identified virus that is closely related to the common cold, the common cold, and SARS-CoV. The first known case of the virus was reported on 1 December 2019 and the person was found to have no apparent link to the meat market.
In the early batch of cases in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be in contact with the market.
An unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 reported that a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province may have been the first case, and that it may have occurred on 17 November 2019.While the arrival of new cases in China has decreased, with a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new patients coming for treatment outside China has exceeded the number of those coming for treatment within China for the first time, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on 26 February 2020.
Significant underreporting of infections, especially in those with mild symptoms, may have been observed.
As of 26 February, relatively few young cases have been reported, with only 2.4% of those globally aged 19 and under. Patrick Valens, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimates that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
These represent the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those tests have been confirmed according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and several countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have official policies not to test those with moderate symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that 86% of COVID-19 infections in China as of January 23 were undetected and 79% of confirmed cases were transmitted by these undetected infections.
A statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that there may be significantly more cases in Italy than were openly reported.
The baseline estimates of the reproductive factor (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Many people affected by COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not, the time from onset to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10th April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have occurred due to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of the deaths were over 60 years of age and 75% of these patients had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.According to official protocols, only confirmed cases of coronavirus disease and deaths are usually counted in the official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be too high, as this may not include those who die without testing - e.g. in homes, nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during pandemics exceeded the official coronavirus death toll by a factor of 4-5x.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that ""we know that [the death toll] has been underestimated"", a statement confirmed by a small number of epidemiological reports in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs when outbreaks occur, even during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, there were a dozen deaths each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, deaths had been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica. Various grading systems are commonly used for death statistics.
The numbers vary over time depending on the region, and are determined by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing done, the quality of the health system, treatment choices, the time from the onset of the disease to the present, age, gender, and overall health. The number of patients and the mortality rate are obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of patients diagnosed over a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the global infection mortality rate is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10th April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the ratio estimates between cases and deaths decreased from 17.3% (as of 1-10 January 2020 for those with symptoms) to 0.7% (as of 1 February 2020 for those with symptoms). Other measures include the Patient Mortality Rate (CFR-CFR), which reflects the percentage of confirmed cases of a disease that die from infection, and the Infectious Mortality Rate (IFR-IFR), which reflects the percentage of those who die from infection (both diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These figures are not chronological and the method of diagnosis is to follow a specific group of people who have been infected.
Many academic institutions have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that during the plague, the infection-related mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and the statistical study analysing the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) insists that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and duration of incidence are uncertain and may vary by location.
"In the untested state, infection usually peaks without change, and then the infectious host begins to decline", says McGeej Boni of Penn State University.
"But it is now almost impossible to devise any sensible plan for when it will be"."
"Zhang Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, insisted that 'it could be over by June' if all countries could be mobilized to follow the World Health Organization's (WHO) advice on measures to contain the spread of the virus".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "is definitely going to be in circulation, and it will last for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, "physical isolation and other measures will be required until a vaccine is available (which may take 18 months or more)".
"I cannot imagine that the coronavirus will disappear completely because it is so instantly contagious", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, adding that it could "become a seasonal disease and return every year".
The severity of a re-infection will depend on the immunity of the population and the extent of the pathogenicity.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively undefined and may still be present in those who are infected.
Fever (88%) and dry cough (68%) were both common symptoms.
Common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory failure (fever), loss of appetite, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, flushing, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea or bruising. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), only one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and bluing of the face or lips as emergency symptoms. If these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is advised.
Since some of the infected were asymptomatic and without clinical symptoms, and were otherwise confirmed as a result of testing, the researchers advised that those who had close contact with the confirmed infected should be closely monitored and tested to be free of infection.
The Chinese estimate the range of asymptomatic rates as low as 44%.
The typical onset period (symptom onset interval) is between one and 14 days, which is usually five days. An example of uncertainty is the estimate of loss of visual sensation in COVID-19 patients, which was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted primarily by small saliva droplets formed during close contact, coughing, sneezing or talking, with close contact being 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) away.
Studies have shown that when the mouth is not closed, the echidna droplets travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that small droplets that may be ejected during speech may also be transmitted through prolonged exposure to air. Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, it can be ejected through breathing air, including during speech.
The fluid droplets may pass into the mouth or nose of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tubal infusion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can spray the airway glands, which can result in airborne transmission of the pathogen.
It can also be spread by touching a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns that it could be spread through feces, it is believed that the likelihood of such a risk is low.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the faeces through the mouth is possible. The virus is most contagious during the first three days of onset of symptoms, but it is also likely to spread in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages of infection.
Some people have confirmed infection three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that the infection may have spread before significant symptoms appear.
Only a few reports exist as asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed infections, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified during contact tracing investigations by some countries.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although there is no clear information on the mode of transmission, we know that one person can usually spread the infection to two to three people, surviving on surfaces for hours to several days.
Specifically, the bacteria has been found to survive for up to three days on polypropylene and 304 grade steel, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature.Covid-19 has also been confirmed in pets and other animals.
While there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, British authorities advise washing one's hands after contact with animals as if infected people might have touched after contact with other surfaces.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COVID-2) is a novel pathogen that was first isolated from three pneumonia-infected individuals in Wuhan who came into contact with a batch of patients with acute respiratory illness.
All traits of the novel SARS-CoV-2 occur naturally in related coronaviruses. The pathogen is killed by household soap as it dissolves its protective envelopes outside the human body. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought that it may have originally spread from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the virus is a beta-coronavirus with two strains of sarcoid (genome B) from algae in the internal genus.
It is 96% identical in total genome to other variants of the coronavirus (VAVAL corona RTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a single amino acid difference in specific parts of the genome sequence between pathogens taken from ants and pathogens that have been transmitted to humans.
The 92% similarity in shared genetic material between ant coronavirus and SARS coronavirus-2 in whole-cell comparisons to date is not sufficient to prove ant viruses as intermediate hosts.
The diagnosis of infection is temporary based on symptoms, but can be confirmed by antibody replication multi-enzyme sequencing (RRT-PCR) in infected stools or by CT normal draft.
A study conducted in Wuhan comparing PCR with CT suggested that although many mapping features of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, CT can show results with significantly greater clarity than PCR.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CdCT should not be used as a first-line test or screening test for COVID-19".
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test is conducted using real-time Reverse Replication Multivariate Enzyme Sequencing (RRT-PCR).
It can be tested on breath or blood samples.
Results usually come within a few hours to a few days.
Although a throat scan can also be used, generally, this test is performed on the nasal mucosa. Several laboratories and companies are developing noninvasive test methods for detecting antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been confirmed to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
The cellulology test developed by CELEX is approved for use by certified laboratories in the United States for emergency use only.
Characteristic features of X-rays and Radiographic Telescopy (CT) on symptomatic people include asymmetrical surface glass translucency and non-flare fluids.
The International Internet Database of Natural Draft Discoveries for Positive Individuals is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
The standard drawing without PCR confirmation, which is used in conjunction with other infections such as adenomyositis, has a particular peculiarity in identifying COVID-19.
Although comparing chest CT results with PCR is less likely to accurately detect infection by mapping, a large-scale study in China has demonstrated that it is faster and more immediate in showing the effects, suggesting that CT could be considered a diagnostic tool for determining the impact of an epidemic.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect the draft characteristics of the pathogen with both X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and doing things like coughing or sneezing on a tissue and placing the tissue directly in a garbage can.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. Many governments have imposed travel bans on affected countries and areas and all non-essential travel.
However, in most parts of the world, the virus has reached a community stage.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community may not know where or how they became infected. Routine precautions, such as contact precautions and eye protection are recommended when caring for those who may have been infected. Monitoring contacts is an important tool for health officials to determine the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The use of location data provided by mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised controversy over privacy violations, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for restrictions on the use of this type of surveillance.
Various mobile phone apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen teams of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, including recording the user's proximity with another mobile phone using Bluetooth.
Users will receive a text message if they have had close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are being spread, for example, that washing the nose and mouth with a mouthwash will not help.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however, various organizations are working to develop one.
It is recommended to rub and wash hands thoroughly to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when they are dirty when looking at hands; before eating; after blowing their nose; and after sneezing or sneezing.
Because outside the human body, the pathogen is killed by household soap, which breaks its protective bubble.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol in cases where soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands properly.
Surfaces can be cleaned with a number of solvents including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine (within one minute of disinfecting the steel surface).
Other solvents such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate are less efficient.
The CDC recommends that disinfection measures be taken in places where COVID infection is suspected or where there are confirmed cases, such as offices or day care centres, office areas, toilets, common areas used by affected persons, and electronic devices such as mobile phones, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, cash dispensers, etc.
Health authorities also recommend that people bend their knees or cover their mouth and nose with tissue during coughing or sneezing, and dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people with infection, as wearing a mask will limit the amount of fluid and travel distance when breathing, which is dispersed during talking, snoring and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has released guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a pathologist at the University of Leeds, "While lack of proper hand hygiene is a significant contributor to the spread of infection, wearing masks will reduce the urge for people to touch their faces". Caregivers of those who may have been infected are also recommended to wear masks.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthy individuals wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid touching the face.
Many countries have started to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-used medical-use mask made of cloth. China has specifically recommended that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends the wearing of surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear masks when out in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since March, has ordered passengers to wear masks on trains and intercity buses from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear masks whenever going out, while recommending that those who cannot afford masks make masks at home.
Masks are also being widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure that delays the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The guidelines include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, sports halls, theatres or shopping malls.
Individuals can use social distancing methods by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments have mandated or recommended social distancing in affected areas.
The maximum recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was reduced from 250 people per bed (if there is no known COVID-19 outbreak in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the presence of more than two people in public places. The CDC advised that the elderly and people with chronic health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immunodeficiency, are at high risk of serious health disorders and complications, and that such people should stay indoors as much as possible in areas where social contagion has occurred. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health organizations began using the phrase ""social distancing"" to explain that the actual, specific, or remote social contact is the same as the replacement of the body with the same contact".
The use of the phrase "social distancing" has led to the assumption that people should be completely isolated from society, rather than encouraging alternative forms of interpersonal contact. Some officials have even issued sexual health guidelines to be used during an epidemic.
This includes being advised to have sex only with the person you live with who is not infected or who has no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation, and many governments have mandated or recommended self-isolation for all people living in affected areas.
Strong self-isolation guidelines have been issued for the high risk groups.
Those who consider that they may have been in contact with someone affected by COVID-19 and have recently traveled to a country or region where there is a high prevalence of infection are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the date of the last case.
Control or suppression and mitigation are strategies for controlling the impact of disease.
Control measures are being taken at the early stages of the outbreak, aimed at identifying and isolating those infected, and introducing other measures to control the outbreak and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are slowed down: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures can be combined simultaneously.
More aggressive action is needed in curbing the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction rate to less than 1. This is known as flattening the epidemic curve, an attempt to reduce the epidemic escalation as part of managing the spread of the disease.
This reduces the risk of overload by health services and provides more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-drug interventions that can manage the spread include individual preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; social measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling gatherings; social engagement to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleanup. Several strict measures aimed at controlling the spread, such as isolating entire cities and imposing strict travel restrictions, were clearly carried out deliberately in China.
Other countries also took various measures to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced massive testing and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those affected and isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has also imposed fines for stockpiling medical supplies that increase mask production. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show major challenges in mitigation (preventing the spread of malaria but not stopping it) and containment (reversing the progression of the epidemic).
Better prevention policies could reduce peak health care needs by two-thirds and deaths by half, but would result in tens of thousands of deaths and health systems collapse.
Prevention can be prioritized, but it must be maintained until the virus is spread in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first), as the measures can be relaxed and spread again at a faster rate.
The long-term containment of the pandemic has social and economic costs.
There is no specific anti-virus drug against COVID-19 infection, but efforts are underway to develop it, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter tranquilizers, drinking fluids, and resting may help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, biotherapy, neural fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other pathogens are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also suggested that some "traditional and home remedies" may provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Capacity building and healthcare adaptation to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a basic response to the pandemic.
ECDC and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at several levels including centralization of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancellation of non-compulsory procedures where possible, isolation and quarantine of COVID-19 infected patients and enhancement of intensive care capabilities through training of staff and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are various theories as to where the first infected person (called patient zero) was first infected.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei gradually increased.
These were often linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. Another theory is that the pathogen came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, that it had a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia block of unknown cause was detected on December 26 and treated by Hubei Provincial Hospital doctor Zhang Xian, who reported it to the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC (CDC) on December 27.
On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a 'SARS-like coronavirus.'
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Authority later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization (WHO).
In early January, health officials in Wuhan were informed of the number of patients with undiagnosed pneumonia, which was enough to start a trial. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of patients doubled every seven and a half days.
With the help of the displacement during the Chinese New Year and Wuhan being the transportation hub and major serial junction, the virus spread to other provinces of China in early and mid-January 2020.
On January 20, China recorded almost 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed infections in the world.9 As of April 2020, 1.61 million infections have been reported globally, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
There was at least one outbreak in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the massive spread of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement between them and have established border controls.
National responses include quarantines (also known as stay-at-home orders, stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, with more than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India under lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; the first confirmed case was reported on November 17, according to another unconfirmed report.
Dr. Zhang Jixian diagnosed the batch of pneumonia patients with unknown cause on December 26 and informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC (CDC) on December 27 through the hospital where he worked.
The initial genetic testing of the patient's samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Authority on December 31.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on the same day.
"Once these reports were released, the police warned doctors in Wuhan of 'spreading rumours' about the spread".
The National Health Commission of China initially insisted that there was no 'clear evidence' of human-to-human transmission.
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a vigorous campaign, which Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping described as a 'people's war' to control the spread of the virus".
"In what has been described as 'the greatest isolation in human history,' a sanitation curfew was declared on January 23 to halt travel in and out of Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people".
The use of private transportation is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The provisional hospital, Huoshensan Hospital, was completed in 10 days, officials said.
Another hospital, the Licensing Hospital, was built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and sports stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government took additional measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including issuing health notices to passengers and extending the festival holiday in Ilanwen.
Schools and universities across the country were closed.
Several activities were undertaken in the Hong Kong and Macau areas, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work operations were established in many Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and out of Hubei.
Public transport has been reorganized and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
"It is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of external restrictions after the imposition of public movement restrictions in many cities. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took drastic measures to prevent the virus from being 'imported' from other countries".
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all international travellers entering the city. On March 23, in mainland China, until five days earlier, only one case had been reported domestically, transmitted by a traveller returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of the disease has been contained on a domestic basis and that the spread in China is under control.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020, that entry permits for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28th. No specific details were given on when the policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On 30 March, the Chinese government encouraged the reopening of businesses and factories, and provided monetary incentive packages to those enterprises. The State Council announced the launch of a day of mourning with a three-minute national silence at 10:00 am on 4 April, which was in conjunction with the Qingming Festival. The central government asked families to pay their respects online for observing physical distancing to avoid a resurgence of the coronavirus-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 has been confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on 20th January 2020.
The country's health agency said the number of confirmed cases peaked on February 20, attributing it to a recent attack in Daegu on behalf of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji pilgrims visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being affected by the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 people who follow the church, 1,261 or 13 percent have reported symptoms. South Korea issued a high-level alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, Korea had more than 2,000 confirmed cases, which rose to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been closed after three soldiers were confirmed to have contracted the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, so they were rescheduled. South Korea launched what is considered the largest and best-organized program in the world to detect the spread of the virus among the general public, isolate them if they are infected, track down those who have come into contact with them, and isolate them.
The diagnostic methods include mandatory self-reporting of new international passenger symptoms through mobile app, drive-through testing to test for viral impact based on results available the next day and increasing testing capacity to up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's plan to contain the spread, although not to isolate entire cities, is considered successful. There were two divergent opinions in South Korean society regarding President Moon Jae-in's actions in handling the crisis at first.
Many Koreans signed petitions praising Moon for his performance and calling for him to be removed because of the government's handling of the pandemic.
On March 23, South Korea reported its lowest one-day infections in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks from April 1.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea had received requests from 121 different countries for help in testing for the virus.
Iran announced the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Quom on February 19, with two deaths on that day, according to the country's Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Initial lockdown measures announced by the government include cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports matches and Friday services, as well as closure of universities, higher education institutions and school halls.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani had announced on 26 February 2020 that there are no plans to quarantine the affected areas and that only individuals will be quarantined.
Although plans to restrict inter-city travel were announced as early as March, heavy traffic continued to move between cities ahead of the Persian New Year's Navruz.
Shiite places of worship in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, when Iran became the epicenter of the outbreak after China in February.
Amid claims of covering up the extent of the spread in Iran, more than ten countries have detected their infections originating from Iran as of February 28, suggesting that this may be much higher than the 388 infections reported by Iran on that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iran's prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peacefully protesting and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The risk of transmission is reported to be high in all directions enclosed areas, such as detention centres, which lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government said 100 deaths had been recorded in one day, the highest number since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
On March 23, Iran was recording 50 new cases per hour and one death every 10 minutes due to the coronavirus.
World Health Organization (WHO) officials believe that five times more people may have been infected than reported in Iran.
It is also suggested that Iran's financial capacity to contain the spread of the virus may have been impaired due to US sanctions on Iran.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for easing of sanctions on countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The spread was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31st after two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases began to rise sharply, leading the Italian government to suspend all flights with China and declare a state of emergency.
An uncontacted batch of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced a new arbitration law to contain the spread, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
"Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in the areas of outbreak, no entry or exit will be allowed", he said.
'Working activities and sporting events have already been ordered to be suspended in those areas.' 'On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country as the country reached 100 deaths.'
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were supposed to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all games were postponed altogether for at least a month.
On 11th March, Prime Minister Kanté ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities except for supermarkets and pharmacies. The Italian College for Emotional Anaesthesia, Pain Relief, Cardiovascular Rehabilitation and Intensive Care (SIARTI) on 6th March issued a medical protocol containing recommendations for the conduct of treatment based on the degree of infection.

As of 5 April, the number of confirmed cases in Italy stands at 128,948, with 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, most of them in the Lombardy region.
The CNN report points out that Italy's high elderly population and the inability to test everyone with the virus to date may contribute to the high mortality rate.
The UK has been the most generous of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government has not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its lack of speed and intensity in addressing the concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a notice advising against all non-essential travel and social interaction, recommending that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as neighbourhoods, restaurants and cinemas.
On 20 March, the government announced the immediate closure of recreational establishments such as spas and gyms, and pledged to provide 80 per cent of the wages for workers up to £2,500 per month to avoid the unemployment crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister imposed strict social distancing measures, a ban on gatherings of more than two people, and restrictions on outdoor activities that require travel and necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through fines and the dissolving of gatherings.
"Most other business establishments, except those considered ""essential"" including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and vehicle repair shops, were ordered to close".

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the US government's premier public health agency, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the US started testing slowly, which hid the true extent of the infection at the time.
The testing was distorted by the defective testing kits produced by the Central Government in February, the lack of approval by the Central Government for non-government testing kits (through academia, institutions and hospitals) by the end of February and the regulatory criteria for people to qualify for testing until the beginning of March.
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.

He then sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 5 artificial respirators to Panama.
The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic also expressed concern about Chinese-made masks and testing kits.
For example, Spain has recalled 58,000 test kits made in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands has recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks.
Belgium returned 100,000 masks as unusable, which were thought to have come from China, but in fact they came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency assistance programs for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has commended the efforts of Chinese authorities to manage and control the spread of the disease.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has noted a major shift between the current situation and the situation that preventative and control efforts were hampered by Chinese authorities' lack of information during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. During the current crisis, the central government ""provided periodic updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday"".
"On 23 January, regarding the decision of the central authorities to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galleya said, 'This is certainly not recommended by the WHO, but is a very important sign of the commitment to contain it in the area where the outbreak is most affected. This is unprecedented in the history of public health. Human-to-human transmission continues to be confirmed in other countries beyond China, and due to the increased number of cases, this is the first time since the WHO declared the outbreak to be of international concern as a public health emergency (PHEIC-30), the first time since 2009 when the WHO declared the outbreak to be of international concern".
"The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom, said that 'PHEIC has been declared because of the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries without strong health systems.'
Referring to the travel restrictions in place, Tedras said that "unnecessary interference in international travel and trade is unnecessary" and that "the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend reducing trade and movement".
"Reiterating the urgent need to help countries that lack the means to detect people infected with the virus even when it appears, the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 5 appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries".
In further statements, Tedros said, "We are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "try it today or lose more later". On February 11, the WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease at a press conference.
'On the same day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he would agree to provide 'the power of the entire UN system to confront this.'
The resulting United Nations Crisis Management Panel, which will coordinate information from all the United Nations, will "help focus on health information while other organizations contribute their expertise to address the broader social, economic and developmental impact of the pandemic", says the World Health Organization (WHO).
"On February 14, a joint working group led by the World Health Organization was activated with China to assist international and World Health Organization (WHO) experts on the ground in China in domestic management, conducting workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions to assess ""the severity and prevalence of the disease"" and conduct a field study to assess ""the impact of prevention measures at the provincial and state level, including urban and rural settings"".On February 25, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for "a more prepared world for the possibility of the coronavirus pandemic spreading", and said that countries should be "still in a state of preparedness", even though it is a time to experiment".
"In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, a joint mission team was dispatched by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials announced that the global coronavirus threat rating would be raised from ""high"" to ""very high"" - the highest level of alert and risk assessment for the country".
"Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement, 'This is a reality check for every government in the world: wake up.'
"The virus may be coming, so you have to be prepared", he stressed, adding that the right control measures would help the world avoid "its worst part".
'Ryan added that current data does not require public health authorities to declare it a global pandemic, and that such a declaration would mean 'we accept that every human on the planet is susceptible to the virus.'
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic.
The WHO is "deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming inaction", the Director-General said. The WHO has faced significant criticism for its perceived inadequacy in handling the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
Part of the backlash was a petition signed by 733,000 people as of April 6 calling for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom.
On 26 March 2020, UN human rights experts urged respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The panel said that everyone has the right to access life-saving devices and the government has the duty to do so.

Several provincial-level CPC executives were fired for their handling of isolation efforts in central China, seen as a sign of dissatisfaction with the party's executive response to the spread in those regions.
Some critics believe the move was made to protect Communist Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials rejected earlier acknowledgments that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favour of the consensus theory that the origins of COVID-19 could have been in the United States or Italy.
"Donald Trump's US administration's referring to the coronavirus as the 'Chinese virus' or 'Wuhan virus,' which is China's 'over-stimulation of a virus that has become a global pandemic,' was criticized by some critics as racism and 'a reversal of his administration's failure to contain the disease.'"
"The Daily Beast received a US government message outlining a communication plan from the National Security Council, 'that all about China is a strategy that is quoted.'
'We are told that this message must reach us in some form, including by press conference and appearing on television.' 'Sites such as Polittico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg say that China's efforts to send aid to the countries affected by the virus are part of a campaign to undermine global influence.'
'There is a geopolitical component, including the struggle for influence through enrichment and the 'politics of liberalism,'' warned EU foreign policy chief Joseph Borel.
'Unlike the US, China is actively spreading its commitment to be a responsible and reliable partner,' Borel said.
China has called on the US to lift economic sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid to the two countries that are lagging behind.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.

On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
"The Italian newspaper La Stampa, citing an unnamed ""high-level political source"", said that 80 percent of Russian aid was ""useless or of little use to Italy"".
The source accused Russia of conducting "geopolitical and diplomatic" self-promotion.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
"When we offer aid to our American counterparts, instead of speeding up the production of medical equipment and supplies in the United States, [Putin] assumes that the Americans will return the same aid if necessary", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
'The largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, Defender 2020, will be conducted on a small scale in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states.'
Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, has criticized Defender 2020 exercise as: "In the current public-health crisis, it affects not only the lives of the troops of the US and several European countries participating in the event, but also the people of the countries where the event is taking place. The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about two dozen MPs and fifteen current or former political figures affected".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to international leaders on March 14, 2020, saying his country was being held back in fighting the pandemic because of the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has intensified demands that the US also follow social policies commonly followed in other wealthy countries, including health care, universal childcare, paid family leave and massive financial allocations for public health.
Political analysts expect it could have negative implications for Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Due to the pandemic, diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated.
"South Korea has criticized Japan's ""vague and hostile quarantine efforts"" after Japan announced that arrivals from South Korea would be placed in quarantine at government-designated sites for two weeks".
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's decisions to deal with the crisis.
Several Koreans, including one Sara, signed petitions calling for a criminal investigation of Moon and one Sara, saying her response was commendable, based on their claims that the government had mishandled the outbreak.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it might allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament has voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to be sworn in indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those deemed to have spread misinformation about the pandemic and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus pandemic has been responsible for a number of incidents including supply shortages, overuse of equipment globally to fight the epidemic, over-demand for unwarranted fears and disruption of industrial and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in supply.
Many areas are panicked and there is a shortage of supplies as essential groceries like food, toilet paper and tap water are being wiped out.
The Department of Technology had specifically warned that there would be delays in the export of electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a twenty-fold increase in the price of the normal and has delayed the supply of medical supplies by four to six months.
This has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned poses a risk to healthcare workers.
In Australia, the epidemic provided a new opportunity for merchants called Tykov to sell Australian goods within China.
The practice was later banned by the Australian government as it caused shortages of baby food in some supermarkets. Both areas were spared severe food shortages despite the high impact of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, which had high demand for food items.
China and Italy's actions against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products are working successfully, avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
There was no major production decline in northern Italy, which is a significant agricultural producer, but industry representatives believe prices could rise.
Even in Wuhan, food shelves were temporarily empty, as Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure that the public had enough to eat.
Italy also has laws requiring food manufacturers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, as a result of government measures to contain the spread of the virus, China's economy suffered the most severe attack in the first two months of 2020 and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As the Chinese mainland is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the spread of the virus is seen as a major threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agathe Demarise of the Economic Intelligence Bureau has predicted that markets will remain volatile until the possible consequences are clear.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic downturn caused by the current pandemic would be greater than the one caused by the SARS pandemic in 2002-2004.
According to an expert at Washington University in St. Louis, the impact on the world's supply chain could be more than $300 billion over two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was put on a hard footing as oil prices fell sharply due to a decline in Chinese purchasing demand.
Global stock markets collapsed on February 24 due to a significant increase in COVID-19 infections outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, various U.S. stock market indices, including the NASDAQ-100 (NASDAQ), the S&P 500 (S&P) index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their fastest decline since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three stock indexes fell by more than 10% over the weekend.
On February 28, the Scop valuation firm GmbH confirmed China's sovereign currency rating, but extended its negative outlook.
Shares fell again on the basis of the coronavirus fears, with the highest fall occurring on March 16.
Many are speculating that a recession may occur.
Economist Mohamed El-Arian has praised the timely emergency measures taken by the central banks and the ARAZ.
Central banks are acting much faster than they reacted during the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel restrictions, closure of public places including travel destinations and advisories from governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, a number of airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the UK's regional carrier Flybe has suffered a decline.
The impact on cruise industry is unprecedented.
Several serial stations and ferry sectors have been closed.
The outbreak coincided with the Sunny, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large gatherings, including annual New Year celebrations, were cancelled by national and regional governments, and private companies have closed their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland independently.
Various New Year's events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid large crowds, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple sights in Beijing.
Officials in 24 municipalities and districts in 31 provinces of China extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and advised most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of its exports.
Hong Kong, which has raised infectious response levels to record highs and declared a state of emergency, closed schools and cancelled New Year celebrations until March. Retail has been hit globally by reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50-60% drop.
This is a 33-43% decrease in the number of customers in the outlets in March compared to February.
Additional measures were taken by shopping mall operators around the world, such as increased sanitation measures, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the pandemic-induced recession will leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to the pre-pandemic situation.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic was at its peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
China's nearly 300 million suburban migrant workers are either stuck at home in the inland provinces or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus pandemic could cause 47 million job losses in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (daily wage earners) unemployed. An Angus Reid survey found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some form of job loss.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers were claiming temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers were applying under the Universal Credit scheme. In Germany, almost half a million companies have sent their workers under the government-subsidized short-term work scheme known as Gussabeit.
France and Britain are following Germany's short-term work-compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, affecting the operations of companies and individuals - both permanent employees and freelancers - globally.
Arts and cultural sector institutions tried to sustain their (often publicly funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage to the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and supporting artists where possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world and at various scales will be cancelling or postponing and closing their exhibitions, events and performances indefinitely.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly occurring consequence of the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, important sporting events, as well as other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also been disrupted, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome during the final week of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay home safely rather than attend Sunday prayer meetings; some churches offer church services over the radio, live broadcast or television and some offer services for worship in drive-in mode.
The Roman Catholic Diocese closed its churches and evacuated Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square following the closure of other religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras, which have also cancelled their services and restricted public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and mosques were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own citizens from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused a significant disruption to the conduct of sporting events globally since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season have been cancelled or postponed.
"The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the IOC announced on March 24 that the event would be ""rescheduled for a date beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021"".Casinos and other sports venues worldwide are closed and live poker tournaments are postponed or cancelled".
This has paved the way for many gamblers to move to the Internet, with many online gambling sites raising fees for new entrants. The entertainment industry has also been hit, with various bands postponing or cancelling their concert tours.
Many big theatres like Broadway have suspended all shows.
"Some artists have found new ways to produce and share performances on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live broadcast concerts or creating web-based ""festival"" events for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work".
Online, a number of coronavirus-themed internet memes have provided humor and distraction to many amidst the instability.
Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, China and East Asia have been the most affected countries, with large-scale discrimination, xenophobia and racial intolerance against people in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents that cause fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February reports (with the majority of the impact being confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed against different groups of Chinese people around the world, such as those who claim that you deserve to be infected, or that this is just a fair punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also increased in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have complained of discrimination based on their regional origin.
We have received direct and online assistance from China in the affected areas.
As the spread to new hotspots intensifies, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to have a severe outbreak of COVID-19, will also be subject to suspicion and racism. Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to contain the disease.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is popular in Japan.
Chinese and other Asian nationals in the UK and US have reported increasing racial slurs and attacks against them.
US President Donald Trump's "Chinese virus" has been criticized as an act of racism and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Santsari.
Students from North Eastern states of India, which share the border with China, who are staying in other major cities of India, have been reported to be in a state of shock over the spread of the coronavirus.
'The Chinese have destroyed nature, and therefore God is taking revenge on them,' said BJP West Bengal State Committee Chairman Dilip Ghosh.
"These comments were later condemned as ""false"" by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata. In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people have been increased by the robbery epidemic. Foreigners living there have been referred to as ""foreign trash"" and targeted as ""those to be thrown away"".
Many newspapers have removed the subscriber-only e-mail system on their websites, with some or all of the coronavirus-related news being read.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers on pathology available for anyone to read.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-print servers like BioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and other antibodies produced in response to the infection.
RT-PCR detection of RNA of coronavirus has confirmed the presence of the virus in the samples.
The test is specific and designed to detect only the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the most recent or active outbreaks.
Antibody detection (opticology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Other antibody tests show how many people have been affected, including those with low levels of symptoms or asymptomatic.
The results of this test will enable to determine the exact mortality rate and herd immunity in the population.
Due to limited testing, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their total population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests varies widely from country to country.
This variant may significantly affect reported mortality rates, and is likely to be significantly higher in some countries.
Real-time retrospective transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be used to test respiratory samples obtained by various methods including nasopharyngeal pancreatitis or cochlear sampling.
Results usually come within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR test, which is taken from the throat by panchrut (swap), will only give reliable results in the first week of the onset of the disease.
Then the virus disappears in the throat but reaches the lungs and continues to multiply.
During the second week of testing in the affected individuals, either intravenous aspiration or coughing may be used as alternatives.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed using real-time retrospective transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) at Charidee in Berlin in January 2020, and formed the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK has developed testing systems similar to the one in place. South Korean company CoGen Biotech developed a PCR-based, clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerSec CoronaVirus) on January 28, 2020.
"It is targeting the ""E"" genome shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp genome specific to SARS-CoV-2". In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medicines Administration of China to use PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing the RTRp for the international community through its novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Coronavirus Investigation.
Trials at the CDC in Atlanta were disrupted by one of three genetic tests in earlier versions of the kit, which yielded unclear results due to erroneous test materials, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, the tests using the two components have not been determined to be reliable, and state and local laboratories have not been allowed to conduct the tests till now.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization and commercial laboratories in the US began conducting the trials in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing systems are available nationwide.
As of March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics has facilitated the nationwide COVID-19 testing.
No dose limits have been announced and sampling and processing should be done in accordance with the conditions recommended by the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test system was developed and manufactured by the State Research Centre for Toxicology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
The trial was recorded on February 11, 2020 by the Federal Service for Monitoring Dependent Partnerships in Healthcare. It was announced on March 12, 2020 that Mayo Clinic had developed a test system to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the optimal test system to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period, meaning a machine that would perform the most tests in 3.5 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct testing with Abbott's M2000 system; similar authorization has previously been granted to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, CEBIT received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a 45-minute test procedure.
The FDA has approved a trial using isothermal coagulation technology instead of PCR.
Since no alternate temperature cycles are required, the system can provide positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Abbott currently has about 18,000 machines in the United States and is looking to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. In particular, a test using a single-copy transcript that binds to the amniotic protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan. If successful, it is hoped that results could be delivered in 15 to 20 minutes, as in the Rapid Flu test.
A March 2020 article review commented that "Diagnosis by chest X-rays is less likely in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results may even show that symptoms are present before they appear".
Common features in CT include a bi-directional polygonal ground-glass translucent with external, asymmetrical and rearward distribution.
When the disease progresses, subclavian stasis, distorted airways and hardening develop.
At the onset of the current pandemic in Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT suggested that although many of the mapping features of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, CT is significantly more clearly showing results than PCR.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test or first-line test for detection of COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for use as a baseline test".
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can also be used for population monitoring to detect infection and determine immunity in individuals 7 or more days after the onset of symptoms, and for evaluation at central laboratories (CLTs) or points of care (PoCTs).
These assessments can be performed by high-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories, but their availability depends on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of extracellular blood is usually used for CLD, although a series of samples may be used to simulate immune response.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually obtained by a small puncture in the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, pre-assessment isolation is not required. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released on 26 March 2020 the names of 29 companies that have been certified to currently distribute their antimicrobial tests as they provide information to the company on demand.
As of April 7, 2020, only one trial has been approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization. Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epidopathic Diagnostics, which manufacture test kits to detect IgG and IgA antibodies from blood samples, received European approvals for their test kits in late March 2020.
Being capable of testing several hundred samples within a few hours, it will provide results much faster than conventional PCR assessment of pathogenic RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection. They found in early April that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the UK were fit for use.
"Hong Kong has a scheme whereby suspected patients stay at home, spit in a sample tube provided to the 'emergency care unit patient', and return it shortly after to receive a test result. The programme of testing suspected patients at home is run by the British NHS, thus avoiding the risk of infection to others if the patient comes to the hospital or the risk of disinfection if the patient is sedated. Health professionals perform D-Row tests for COVID-19 on suspected patients using the same precautionary measures".
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea deliver the fastest and most comprehensive testing of any country, with a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day through the mobile system, and 10,700 tests in the last week, the National Association of Legal Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2.
When a doctor orders a test, the costs are covered by the health insurance company.
According to Robert Koch, the head of the company, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, in many major cities, vehicle-based testing was being provided.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany is not known as it only reports the number of confirmed test results.
"In the first laboratory study, up to the 12/2020 calendar week, 33,491 samples (6.9%) out of 483,295 samples tested including the 12/2020 week were SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected. Researchers from the Israeli-based Tegan and Ram Hospital developed and tested a system for simultaneous testing of samples from 64 patients only if the samples collected and the consolidated sample were found to be positive for further testing. A 10,000-sample laboratory (BGI) in Wuhan, temporarily located on a 2000 square meter area, named "Hu-yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Iron Eye" in English), was opened on 5 January 2020".
The samples show that had the five-day test system not been implemented under the direct supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian, the number of patients in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the cost of coping with isolation would have doubled.
Hu-Yang laboratories in a total of 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, have been systematically monitoring the operations of the Wuhan laboratory.
By March 4, 2020, the daily efficiency is a total of 50,000 tests per day. Open source, multiplex designs published by Origami Assessments have been released, which can test 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 assessments. These standardized designs can be run in small labs without the need for robotic fluid handlers.
By March, shortages of test material and insufficient stockpile had prevented large-scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This led some creators to explore the protocols for preparing samples that require releasing RNA genomes to conduct testing by heating them to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes. On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE is testing its population on a larger scale than other countries and is on track to increase the testing volume with the aim of testing a large part of its population.
"This is done by purchasing a drive-through facility and a population-performing laboratory (based on the ""Hu-Yan"" emergency diagnostic laboratories in China) from Group 42 and BGI".
The lab, which was completed in 14 days, has the capacity to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world to operate outside China with such capacity.
Different test methods were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile.
The WHO adopted the German recipe to produce kits that would be sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to make their own.
The German follow-up process was released on 17 January 2020; the US Centers for Disease Control developed protocol was not available until 28 January, delaying trials in the US. The US and China experienced some problems with the reliability of test kits at the early stages of the outbreak, and neither Australia could provide sufficient equipment to meet the testing and requirements as recommended by health experts.
Instead, South Korea's large-scale testing has helped slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, experts say.
The testing capability, mostly in private sector labs, was built by the South Korean government over many years.
The WHO advised on March 16 that the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19 was to accelerate testing programs. Hundreds of thousands of tests were pending at private labs in the US due to the need for high-level testing due to the increasing spread of the virus.
In March 2020, China announced that there were problems with the accuracy of their testing kits.
"In the United States, the CDC developed test kits that were ""defective"" and the government subsequently lifted bureaucratic restrictions that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen BioEasy Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but the results were found to be false".
The company explained that the erroneous results may have resulted from errors in sampling or the correct use of the instruments.
The Spanish ministry said it would withdraw kits that gave false results and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen BioEC. 80% of the test kits purchased from the Czech Republic from China gave false results. 1.2 million test kits purchased from China by Slovakia were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovik suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a 'high error rate' and 'could not be put into use', said Turkish Health Ministry's Ate Kara. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but declared them unusable in early April 2020.
Testing and tracing of positive SARS-CoV-2 contacts and isolation process
Researchers in Vaul, Italy, where the first COVID-19 death occurred, conducted two rounds of testing at approximately ten days intervals in the town of about 3,400 people.
Half of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic and all the confirmed cases were quarantined.
The travel to the city hall was restricted, which eliminated the new infections completely.
Despite the absence of strict restrictions such as mandatory closure of restaurants and retail establishments, due to the intensity of contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus infection in Singapore has been much slower than in other developed countries.
Several events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising its residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holiday break on March 23.
Several countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed the spread of the pandemic through strict contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, while adopting a low-intensity lockdown.
In a statistical study, the countries with the highest test rates had the lowest death rates compared to the number of deaths, as these countries were able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without adequate testing facilities and national laboratories with little experience in COVID-19 send their first five confirmed samples and the first ten samples determined to be COVID-19 free to one of the 16 recommended laboratories of the World Health Organization (WHO) for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 recommended laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
"In the following chart, the column ""% confirmed based on tests"" is affected by a country's policy on testing".
The country that only tests those admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of test-dependent confirmed cases than a country that tests all citizens regardless of whether people have symptoms or not.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of removing dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances from one's hands.
"Regular hand washing with soap at certain ""critical moments"" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are spread through the stool and the mouth".
People can also be infected by respiratory diseases such as the common cold or the common cold. For example, if you do not wash your hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the mucous membranes), you may be infected.
Five important times of the day when hand washing with soap is mandatory: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the nappy, before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food, and when handling uncooked or uncooked meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the baby who used the toilet.
After you have coughed or sneezed, or after you have snorted.
After touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the health practices related to medical practices.
Hand washing before administering medicine or medical services can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other disease-causing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
and reducing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that improved hand-washing routines among children under five years of age may help to increase height by a small margin.
In developing countries, the rates of childhood mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple step could reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea incidence by a third, comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrhea incidents can be attributed to hand washing with soap. As with the automatic behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world, hand washing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia is a major cause of acute respiratory infections, and is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, estimated to claim the lives of 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making it a habit to wash hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccination or medical intervention, almost halve deaths from diarrhea, and a quarter of deaths from severe respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation improvement schemes as part of the Water, Sanitation and Sanitation (WASH) schemes.
Hand washing protects against the evils spread through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an erratic, irregular skin condition called scarring or dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times to wash hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease through the mouth and faeces: after using the bathroom (dressing, defecating), after cleaning the lower part of a baby (changing clothes), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food/after handling uncooked meat, fish or pet meat.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques are needed to prevent the spread of disease are before and after treating a cut or wound; after coughing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the proportion of people who wash their hands with soap is low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study found Saudi Arabia with the highest rate at 97%, the United States with 77% and China with the lowest rate at 23%. There are now many behavioral changes to the practice of handwashing with soap during critical periods.
The Philippines' Department of Education's Emergency Health Program is an exemplary measure to promote children's health and education.
The National Programme focuses on disinfection twice a year, in addition to daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with fluoride.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water improves the removal of microbes from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier of solubility and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser, because the fats and proteins that are the constituents of organic soil are not immediately soluble in water.
However, the purification is aided by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, due to its recyclability, may contain bacteria derived from previous uses.
A small number of studies that have monitored the spread of infectious bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is not possible because the bacteria are swallowed by the lungs.
The CDC says 'Hands-free liquid soap is still desirable.'
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted among the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that antimicrobial-resistant organisms are selective in nature due to the use of prescribed disinfectants or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soaps contain conventional antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of anti-microbial agents.
Therefore, although antimicrobial strains in antibacterial soap powder have not been selected, they may not be as effective as stated when marketed.
In addition to the peripheral agents and skin-protecting factor, advanced formulations may include pH-regulating acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), benzoic acid, which acts as a microbe pollutant, and skin-processing agents (carbohydrates, vitamins, green pepper, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health has suggested that soy sauce is as effective as consumer antibacterial products containing trypanin in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from hands.
The warm water that is convenient for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing dirt and bacteria from the natural oil.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that using hot water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand disinfectants are water-based products that maintain hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water alcohol hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol and are combined with a condenser such as carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) to form gels or a moisturizer such as glycerin for simple use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of aqueous hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Purifiers with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
The alcohol-containing detergents kill bacteria, including the combined drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE) TB and some pathogens (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaginitis, cold sores, and urethritis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubs detergents containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 concentration reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands within 30 seconds of use and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 concentration reduction) of bacteria within 1 minute of use. Hand detergents are highly effective against bacteria and are less effective against some pathogens.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against norovirus (or norvac) type viruses, which are a common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol should be rubbed and used to properly moisten or cover both hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and the hips and tips of all fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visible.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their simplicity and quick destructive actions against microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing when soap and water are not available.
If you do not add flame retardants and/or skin moisturizers to the formula, dry skin can result from frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other laxatives to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or excessive skin resistance to alcohol or hand itching, rarely caused by alcohol-containing additives.
One attraction is that it is less irritating and less likely to cause skin inflammation from touch than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-hydraulic agents do not clean organic materials on hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers like soap and water are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as the germs will still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends heavily on their ingredients and composition, and historically mainly alcohol and alcohol hand sanitizers have been less effective.
Unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy due to repeated use, most recently, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions, compounded programs using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and overall antimicrobial activity after application.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap, and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil is more effective than using water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microbes, it could increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash acts as an disinfectant, because when it comes into contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
When soap was not available, the WHO recommended ashes or sand as an alternative.
The handwashing method for preventing infection recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is as follows:
Wet your hands in hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended, because standing tap water may be contaminated, while the water temperature makes no difference.
Rub your hands with plenty of soap, between the fingers, including the base of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands better when using soap than when using water alone.
Press and rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing with pressure creates a friction that helps remove germs from the skin, while long-term rubbing with pressure removes more germs.
Wash well under running water.
Hand washing in the dish can re-contaminate the hands.
Dry with a clean cloth or let air dry.
Wet and wet hands are susceptible to infection. Usually missing areas without proper hygiene are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and particle-based nail polishes can provide space for microbes.
A moisturizer is often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage, which increases the risk of infection.
Various inexpensive options can be arranged for hand washing where there is no tap-water and/or soap. E.g. pouring water through a suitable drain from a hanging pump or a toilet and/or using ash if developing countries. In situations with low water supply (such as schools or rural areas of developing countries) there are water-saving solutions, soap-pipes and other low-cost options.
"A dip-tape is a simple technique that uses a rope-mounted tilting tap, and consists of a leg-driven lever and soap stick to pour a small amount of water over the hands".
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about how to dry in public toilets.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London and sponsored by the Paper Towels Factory and the European Tissue Symposium, which helped to compare the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in hot-air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increases by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Hand drying with e-air dryer increases the number of bacteria in the fingers by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing hands and wiping with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreased by an average of 76% and on the palms by 77%. Scientists conducted several tests to see if cross-infection was possible due to other users in the bathroom and the environment of the room as a result of each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which blows out air at 180 m/s (650 km/h;400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and tools and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads microbes up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show significant microbial spread. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt (TÜV Product and Environment) evaluated different drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after drying the hands:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper-dryers.
Alternatively, hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes is possible during the journey in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol content.
It was made mandatory in the hospital setting after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the benefits of medical handwashing in preventing disease (1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use reduced infection rates.
Medical handwashing is the gentle rubbing of each part of the hands with soap and water or gel for at least 15 seconds.
Rub your hands together.
If there is debris under the fingernails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can be in the water on hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean cloth.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to stop the water (if necessary, it can also open the exit door).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health-care systems is to remove pathogens and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine states that hand washing is unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
One study shows that regular hand washing and other simple practices can reduce the rate of urinary tract-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a study paper demonstrating quality hand washing and hand rubbing in healthcare settings.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene issued by the organization have been published on the website of the organization for public comment.
A relevant study was conducted by W.D. Al.
If the extent of regulatory compliance is required, commercial organizations can measure and evaluate hand hygiene.
"There are ""five moments"" for hand washing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO):
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before work requiring infection prevention, and
After patient care, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap ("medicinal" or "anti-microbial" soaps) gives the hand wash liquid the ability to kill germs.
Such disinfection may be desirable before surgery or in systems where antibiotic-resistant organisms are most common. A surgical procedure requires a water pipe that can be opened and closed to 'squeeze' one's hands, without touching them. This is done by hand, with some chlorhexidine or iodine washing, sterile towels to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for wiping and another sterile tool for cleaning the under fingers.
I need to remove all the jewelry.
The procedure requires washing hands and foreheads up to the knee, usually for 2-6 minutes.
No need for long scrub hours (10 minutes).
When washing, the water in the forelimbs should be prevented from leaking back to the hands.
After hand washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash hands before and after caring for an infected person or to use hand sanitizer.
In controlling stephlegonal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit from hand sanitization was achieved with the first 20% washing, and the smallest additional benefit when hand sanitization frequency was increased beyond 35%.
Washing with plain soap compared to washing with antibacterial soap was more than three times higher than the rate of food-borne bacterial infection. Rubbing hands with an alcohol-based solution for 30 seconds compared to hand washing with antibacterial soap, rubbing hands with an alcohol-based solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
Soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand washes in reducing H1N1 Influenza A and Clostridium hard seeds from hands. The barriers to improving hand hygiene in healthcare systems include advising employees on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand washing, and providing written and oral reminders to employees.
Further research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different health systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health and good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces challenges achieving universal handwashing practices.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing faucets are scarce near private or public toilets despite the affordable possibilities of building handwashing facilities.
However, less frequent hand washing may be more due to habit than to lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating for hand washing with soap will influence policy decisions, create awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioural change of people.
Monitoring and evaluation are key to its success.
A systematic review of 70 studies of community-based approaches found that increasing handwashing in LMICs was effective, while campaigns via social media were less effective. One example is UNICEF's "three-star approach", a programme to promote handwashing in schools, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health needs.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three star status.
The creation of handwashing stations is part of handwashing promotion campaigns to reduce diseases and child mortality.
Another example of an awareness-raising campaign trying to achieve behavioural change is the Global Handwashing Day. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have suggested that the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries associated with Dali has been overlooked.
However, one study suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly less costly than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable situations, such as mothers of hospital-born or wounded soldiers - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignace Semmelweis of Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English ""founder of modern nursing"."
At the time, most people believed that the miasmus was the cause of infection.
After the foodborne illness and sanitation epidemic of 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) actively promoted hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters about 'correct hand washing techniques' have been hung near hand washing toilets in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets in Germany".
"The phrase 'washing one's hands of something' means to declare that one does not wish to assume responsibility or share in it".
It originated from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the final room of Jesus Christ's crucifixion, but it has become a phrase with a much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth frantically begins washing her hands while trying to clean up an imaginary stain, which is supposed to represent guilt over the crimes she has committed and the crimes she has induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after recalling or thinking about immoral acts, people tend to wash their hands more often than others, and they value hand washing devices more.
And those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a thought are less likely to engage in other "sanitary" activities such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing, using water, but no soap to wash the hands, is part of the ritual hand washing practiced in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith in Judaism, Hinduism, Devila and Nethylam, Lahubo in paganism, and Vudu in Islam. Religions also recommend hygienic hand washing, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam make it mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet.
Furthermore, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam have made it mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
COVID-19-related workplace risk controls
The use of Occupational Safety and Health Measures for risk controls to prevent the spread of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is the workplace risk controls carried out in relation to COVID-19.
The workplace and workplace risk controls are based on the workplace and workplace, sources of risk of infection, severity of disease in the community and risk factors of individual workers who may be affected by COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure workplaces have low levels of occupational exposure to the public and other coworkers, and basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to isolate themselves at home if sick, following proper respiratory practices, maintaining hygiene in the workplace, and continuing to disinfect.
Medium-risk occupations include those that require frequent or close contact with COVID-19 patients or those who have travelled internationally, who are vulnerable, unknown or suspected due to the current social spread.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public such as schools, densely populated workplaces and some high-volume retail establishments.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk controls for this group include better ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, breathing barriers and personal protective equipment to be worn in case of contact with an infected person.
Health and mortuary workers who have been exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 affected person are considered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to be at high risk of infection.
The best risk controls for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilated rooms and appropriate personal protective equipment for the workplace.
COVID-19 infection can have many consequences in the workplace.
Health problems, caregiving, or fear of infection may prevent workers from coming to work.
The patterns of business may change due to changes in the demand for goods and the means of obtaining them (e.g. going out to buy goods during off-peak hours or obtaining goods through supply or drive-through services).
Finally, the export of goods from geographical areas that have been severely affected by COVID-19 may be hindered. An Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan may be used to guide the precautionary measures.
The plans specify the risk levels associated with various workplaces and work tasks, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from household and community settings and risk factors related to the elderly or individual workers with chronic illness.
They outline the necessary controls to avoid risks and the forward-looking plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Goals for responding to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those at high risk with serious health problems, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease affects the response received in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in the field of security and strategic management to group hazard controls by performance.
Where COVID-19 risks are unavoidable, engineering controls followed by administrative controls and finally the use of personal protective equipment are the most effective control methods.
Engineering controls include the isolation of workers from work-related hazards, rather than relying solely on the behaviour of the workers, which is a very cost-effective and easy solution.
Administrative controls are changes in the procedures or policies that an employee or employer must take.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE-PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain levels of risk.
PPE should be selected on the basis of the potential risk to personnel, be suitable for use (e.g. respirators), similarly, be worn properly, be periodically inspected, maintained and replaced if necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have low levels of occupational interaction with the public and other colleagues.
The basic prevention measures recommended for all work activities are frequent and regular hand washing, encouraging workers to isolate themselves at home if sick, respiratory controls including covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, installation of tissue and garbage cans, remote working or managing interrupted work hours if necessary, encouraging workers not to use tools and equipment of others, and regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The early identification and isolation of susceptible persons in a workplace is an important step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms stay home for at least 24 hours after taking a fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medication, until there are no symptoms of fever, flu, or any other symptoms.
According to OSHA, work requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with an individual who is known or suspected to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing community spread around the business area, such as COVID-19 patients or a person who has recently travelled internationally to an area with a high prevalence of COVID-19 is considered as a high risk medium-risk work.
These include workers in contact with the general public in places such as schools, crowded workplaces, and high-risk retail establishments. Engineering controls for teams working in such high-risk environments may include the installation of high-performance air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing non-hazardous non-color slip cloth barriers, and providing a channel-free service to provide information on safety and customer service. The CCO's management controls for this and high-risk committees include encouraging sick workers to remain in isolation, providing hands-on safety equipment to staff in the face of incidents, providing a public safety clearance system and other training on how to use the equipment, providing workers with a safe and timely access to workplaces and other places where they may need to be evacuated, providing training on how to use the equipment, and providing workers with information on how to use the equipment, including the need to provide a safe and timely evacuation system, and providing training on how to use the equipment, including the need to provide workers with a safe and timely evacuation system.
Personnel in this high-risk group rarely require respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board the aircraft, the appropriate restrictions to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, assigning a crew member to serve the sick person, and providing the sick person with a mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue while coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or when touching bodily fluids or surfaces that may be infected. Additional personal protective equipment should be worn if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be stored and disposed of in a biohazard bag, and then contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Risk controls on ships, including luxury ships and other commercial passenger ships, should be undertaken in case of fever or other symptoms while on board, including postponing the voyage if sick and immediately informing the on-board medical centre of self-isolation and disinfection.
In general, the person who is isolated in the room should be screened there. For schools and childcare facilities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that if the infected person has been in the school building, regardless of the social transmission status, the area be cleaned or disinfected for a short period of time.
At the stage of moderate or low social spread, social distancing strategies such as field trips, cancellation of meetings and mass gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or catering at a restaurant, increasing the distance between tables, interrupted attendance and dismissal times, limiting unwanted visitors and using dedicated office sanitation space for children with symptoms such as flu may be implemented.
When there is significant community-level spread, extended school closures may be considered a strategy in addition to social distancing strategies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers that for law enforcement personnel who understand daily routines, the level of immediate health risk is low.
Law enforcement officers who come into contact with persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 impact are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during capture, workbench and clothing should be cleaned and disinfected with household cleaning spray or wipes before use, and the usual procedures for allocation and removal of used personal protective equipment (PPE), clothing allocation and laundry should be followed.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classifies some health and mortuary workers as either high or very high risk.
Healthcare, support, laboratory services providers and medical transport workers for known or suspected COVID-19 patients are among those who perform high-risk infectious work.
The highest risk is considered when the staff is involved in activities such as collecting or handling samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Possible stages of formation of a droplets include intravenous tubing, coughing procedures, pulmonary percussion, certain dental treatments, and sampling by examination or drilling.
High exposure is a risk in morgue work, including workers involved in preparing the bodies of persons known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 at the time of death; these can become extremely high exposure risks if autopsy is performed. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol forming procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some sanitary and mortuary systems.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newly arriving patients should be kept in isolation waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 patients. OSHA recommends that those known to be sick or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 should wear respirators, in addition to PPE, and those serving within 6 feet of each other in situations where there is a risk of rash.
In the United States, NOIH-approved N95 filtration facepiece respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes qualification testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may provide greater protection and comfort for personnel to wear. As COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted through bodily fluids, the WHO does not recommend full-face respirators.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that only personnel working at entry or exit points should be provided with a surgical mask.
For those collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without aerosol-generating procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, safety glasses or face shield, gown and gloves.
In cases where a rash may develop, an N95 or FFP2 respirator is used instead of the surgical mask.
The World Health Organisation recommends reducing the demand for personal protective equipment through inadequate global supply of personal protective equipment, physical barriers such as telemedicine, clear windows, allowing only those engaged in direct care to enter the room with the COVID-19 patient, using only personal protective equipment needed for a specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with a single diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the personal protective equipment supply chain, and encouraging unsigned persons not to use masks.

Date/time of transmission: 14th of March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a special situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear the global interconnectedness of humanity and the responsibilities we have to take on each other.
We have no role model for these challenges, but we know that the best response is to put global compassion, cooperation and community building at the heart of this organization.
The friendliness and concern we have seen from all our colleagues through email, phone calls and chat is a remarkable testament to the good fortune we have had to work with such wonderful people.
I have nothing to be proud of and thank you for but to consider you all as my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me his appreciation for our work.
He reminded me of how important it is that the world is now turning to Wikipedia for information, and that keeping these important resources online and accessible to everyone is a powerful sign.
Whatever you've done, whether it's keeping the sites up and running or paying our peers or helping to keep our communities safe, it's your work that makes it possible.
The information that Wikipedia provides is more important to the world than ever before.
It's time to not only act, but how we do it to make a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this work and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work together from this week.
Changes in our work and action plans
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-group met and discussed our approach and plans for the coming days and months last night.
We discussed what we thought was the appropriate response to the situation we were facing and the best way to keep the company afloat at this time.
We wanted to take the stress off and support our work for the long term.
If you want to reduce its intensity, do it okay.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Four hours a day or 20 hours a week is our daily work expectation.
We are not announcing a holiday - if you want to work overtime, the job will use you to its full potential.
However, the world is currently unpredictable, and you may want to support loved ones, you may want to go grocery shopping, or you may want to go to the doctor, but your well-being is our priority.
We don't track your time.
If you are sick, do not go to work.
We say it, even though we shouldn't.
No medical leave or PTO required - help your team edit calendars and action plans and send information to your manager to ensure that the key areas of work are focused.
(If you are confirmed to have COVID-19, please inform the BRAY at T&C Ops, T&C will provide you with the necessary support and ensure that your situation receives the proper attention from the management.)
Full payment will be given to those who work overtime.
As we have said before, we reiterate our commitment to our contractors and employees to pay them according to the hours they work.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of normal working hours under normal working conditions.
This includes the fact that you are ill and cannot work because of it.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve stress from the world around us.
The work we do, especially at times like this, can have unintended consequences.
Again, this is about your self-defense.
Our request is that you contact your manager so that we can know what to expect and then adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
We have some work to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising groups (among others) are doing the important work that is necessary for additional support.
We will start a process with all sectors to evaluate the current objectives and shift our focus to supporting those that are essential to our work.
We all have a lot of work to do, and we all will focus on the most urgent projects.
The delay will reduce the impact later.
"We do not plan to serve as a 'double time to catch up' once the pandemic is over".
There is no expectation of working overtime to meet an unrealistic deadline.
We accept the changed environment and will work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What is APP?
In order to adapt to the new practice and daily working hours expectations, we have proposed to reschedule the implementation of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 schedule, which gives more time for the next few weeks to plan prioritizing work, self-protection and caring for loved ones to employees while accommodating those who need or want a reduced schedule.
This extension of deadline greatly reduces the current planning workload and pressure across the organisation.
We will present our plan to the Executive Committee next week and update the delegates and committees on the next steps once we have confirmation.
I thank the APP team for their leadership in this.
Office conditions, chance of infection, and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco has been exposed to COVID-19.
However, as a precaution, we cleaned all surfaces in the San Francisco office with antimicrobial cleaning panels to disinfect them.
They used a hospital-grade antibacterial mixture to disinfect surfaces, such as the front room and the propellers that access our platform.
The ethical or legal obligation to use products that ensure the safety of residents is maintained in the building.
As we decide to return to work, we are relieved to know that the office will be ready for us.
Our DC office is located in a viaduct and they have shared their COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC staff.
As of last week, our DC office has fully switched to remote mode in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City know, we are also discussing the possibility of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-term colleagues know this is a fix, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hour increments.
If longer sessions are needed, explore how to split them into sessions of several days.
Clearly define the need for the meeting, create an action plan and send in advance the items to be studied.
Set the event video to default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live syncing and connectivity.
One to organize meetings in advance, one to keep track of questions during the chat and to keep track of the speaker list, and one to help take notes (or take notes together).
If you need a comfortable headset, email technical support.
Use the health care allowance you have been given to buy snacks.
Join the #RemoteNews channel on Slack to talk to your peers about the work being distributed
The HR Task Force is taking steps to implement webinar-based workflow guidance to support the increased level of workloads across the organisation.
We have asked all community grant recipients to cancel public events such as the edithons last week, which are funded by Wikimedia, until the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions would not allow them to complete the grant measures they had agreed to and that no penalty would be imposed for any delay or alteration in achieving those targets.
We will follow further guidelines for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences this week.
For the global community, instead of helping the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and others, this disruption has generally created a tragedy.
With the future in mind, CRT is working on setting up a page on Meta-Wiki for the community to help monitor impact and follow our communications.
Keeping abreast of COVID-19 issues
On the following Thursday, at 14:00 UTC / 07:00 PT, we will send out an invitation to your calendars to attend a special staff meeting.
You can use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time with each other.
We stand by you in this matter and are ready to do all we can to help.
Meanwhile, you can get some information from this email and all the essential COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages periodically and process all the information in one place.
We are also maintaining regular communication with staff residing in the countries that are currently significantly affected.

We are here to provide the necessary support and cooperation.
If you have confidential or sensitive information, please email Brian Judden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an act of abandoning our duty and responsibility.
Rather, they are a recognition that at this time, we may have to re-align our tasks and responsibilities in ways that have never been done before.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other to continue working, to provide the support needed for our movement, and to provide the service that the world is looking for.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and for the important work that is coming in a few weeks or possibly a few months.
We need all of you to make it happen, so we want you to participate as best you can when the need arises and to take care of yourself and your family properly now.
Now, please -- wash your hands, don't touch your face!
The group is composed of Catherine, C.R.T. (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grand I, Heather W, Jamie V, Jane U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'angiodensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2-ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (in the neuronal membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE-2 counteracts the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing ang (1-7), making it a promising target drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE-2 acts as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiodensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-metallic enzyme that is located on the surface of the endometrium and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 site and the C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter site.
ACE2 is the first type of membrane protein to cross once, and the enzyme-dependent part of its activity is expressed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The molecular field of ACE2 is cleaved from the membrane by another enzyme called chetes, and the resulting soluble protein is absorbed into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
Angiodentin-converting enzyme-2 is present in most organs: Angiodentin-converting enzyme-2 is mainly associated with the cell membrane of type II pulmonary alveolar cells, endrocytes of the small intestine, endothelial cells of the artery and spleen, and smooth muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
The expression of ACE2 messenger RNA (mRNA) is found in the cerebral cortex, the retina, the cerebellum, and the brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an anti-balance to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiodentine I into vasoconstict angiodentine II.
CE2 cleaved carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiodensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed it into the vasodilator angiodensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also cause cleavage between several other peptides, such as [des-ARG9]-predicin, epalin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates SLC6.A19, a neutral amino acid transporter that ensures the distribution of proteins and large molecules in cells, which has been confirmed in the rare form of amino acid metastasis, Hartnap disease.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major pathway of entry into cells of certain coronaviruses, including human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), SARS-CoV-SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and the transfer of both the pathogen and the enzyme to endosomes located within the cells.
This entry action requires the enrichment of the S protein by the liver's secretory protein degradation process, DMBRSS2, and is currently being studied to determine whether suppression of this process can be therapeutic. This has led to the hypothesis that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing with standard ACE inhibitors and ARP treatment.
"A formal review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors had a significantly lower 34% risk of pneumonia compared to controls"".
Furthermore, "treatment with ACE inhibitors has also reduced the risk of pneumonia among patients at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with a high risk of stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE reagents reduces pneumonia-related deaths, although the results are weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Reverse human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for acute pulmonary injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemorrhage and biomass synthesis in piglets with acute coagulation-induced respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the start of activity is 30 minutes, with an additional 24 hours (length) of benefit.
Several findings suggest that RHACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with increased circulating angiotensin II. Injectable RHACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
"B'COVID-19 Apps is a cellular-speaking software application designed to assist in contact detection during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected individual".
In some territories and jurisdictions, a number of applications have been developed or proposed with official government support.
Many frameworks have been upgraded for the development of communication tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly with regard to systems based on tracking the geolocation of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On 10th April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate the functionality directly supporting such Bluetooth-based apps on their Android and iOS platforms.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alibaba, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 infected people.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called Trace Everything is used.
The app was developed by the local ICT community, and was released free of charge and will be handed over to the government. Western Macedonia has launched the Bluetooth-based app "Stop Corona!" which detects the exposure of infected individuals and provides rapid information to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government said that the communication tracking app was in an advanced stage of development and would be released within a few weeks, and similar apps were planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's Treastucker app and the Bluetooth protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-fencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, which is designed to keep infected people from leaving home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of defense engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed several possible practical problems with processor-based systems, including false positives and the fact that the take-up of an app would be less effective if limited to a small fraction of the population.
"To address concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple is setting limits on what types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, allowing only ""official"" or reputable companies".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Human rights campaigners expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance using the coronavirus app, in particular whether the surveillance infrastructure, which was created to combat the coronavirus pandemic, will be removed once the threat is contained.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The companies announced eight conditions in the government's plans:
monitoring must be legal, necessary and proportionate;
Extensions of observation and surveillance shall have sunset rules;
Use of data should be for COVID-19 purposes only;
Data security and anonymity shall be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Increasing discrimination and marginalization should be avoided through digital surveillance;
be defined in law regarding sharing of data with third parties;
Citizens should have the right to defend themselves against and confront waste;
"Meaningful participation of all ""relevant stakeholders"" including public health professionals and marginalized groups will be required. The German Kayas Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Onne Grensen) (RSF) have published checklists".
The proposed Google/Apple project seeks to solve the problem of continuous tracking by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems if the tracking mechanism is no longer required.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to bypass tracking.
In Israel, network-based surveillance was authorized.
Network-based solutions that access raw location data have significant potential for privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location information; many privacy-protecting systems have been developed that use central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to identify people who might have been in contact with the infected person.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and then aggregates this information and sends it to vulnerable individuals via micro-data.
The information is used to alert potential contacts, and the government has made location information available to the public, thanks to massive changes in information privacy laws in the country since the outbreak of MERS.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites, and countries including Germany are thought to use both centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of 6th April 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protecting contact tracking is a well-established concept that has been in the research literature since around 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as sending user proximity status to other handsets using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a collaborative initiative that has centralized and decentralized approaches, not a protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protecting proximity detection of potential contacts (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, FKAA event contact numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and mobile communication detection protocols (PCADs), among others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafeBots, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path infiltration information to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
"It is based on research published in the White Paper ""Research published in March 2020 by Apps Con Roke: Maintaining Privacy in a Pandemic"". Another similar initiative is the Secure SafeDress platform of Enigma MBC, a company that develops privacy technologies, a lab originally established by MIT Media".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow sharing of users' sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that information.
On 5 April 2020, the Global DCN-Coalition was established by a consortium of teams with a common approach and often overlapping protocols, with the aim of gradually reducing the use of the global platform for detecting and alerting applications, which is a key element in achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore made its official government application, Plutidress, transparent.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the controllers of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a move to identify the person in contact based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption, which they said would be done in a manner that protects privacy.
They also released the specifications of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be released in three stages:
Official Secret - Tools developed to help governments develop apps to detect potential contacts to protect against coronavirus
It plans to integrate this functionality directly with iOS, Android, Google and Apple, first by distributing the system through operating system updates and resolving recurring monitoring issues, then removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
B' Drug re-use (also called drug reuse, prescription re-use, re-function, or treatment switching) is the re-use of a drug approved to treat a different disease or medical condition than the one originally developed.
It is part of scientific research and is currently being used to continuously improve safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research methods include the discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of sewage to cure the disease. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug proteins, each with multiple muscle binding sites.
The study of these binding sites provides a reasonable framework for the development of effective vaccines against the COVID-19 virus.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papane-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S protein and ATP ribosphate.
Hussain AA, et al. examined several study compounds, then optimized and analyzed their basic similarity with the most approved drugs. This is being done to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his preclinical study for prescription in a clinical trial design.
Chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on March 18 that the four drugs being studied as part of the consolidated clinical trial will include chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine.
New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Organization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and has been approved under the European Union (EUA) to be used only as an investigational treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but unable to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "the use, extent, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for immunization or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been established".
"There is no other way", the doctors said, "but they are taking this medicine".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorogenic in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The NYU Langkawi School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine inhibitor use.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed Favipravir to be ""clearly effective"".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients were confirmed free of infection in an average of 4 days, while 45 patients had a duration of 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan, half of the 240 patients with pneumonia were given favipravir and half received imifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical company reminded people that the current evidence to support the drug was scarce and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its own supply and use the military to deliver the drugs to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has told the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug.
It is not safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
"A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Calethra) concluded that the combination of the antimicrobials lopinavir and ritonavir ""did not produce any benefit"."
These drugs are designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of University of Colorado researchers is trying to modify drugs to detect a compound that binds to the proteases of SARS-CoV-2. Criticism within the scientific community has been directed at re-using evidence of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ridonavir in the international consolidated trial.
Remdesivir was developed and improved by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus disease and Marburg bacterial infections. Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir had peripheral antibacterial activity against several phyllo-, nym-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
The development of resistance through problematic mutations in the immunotherapy can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remdesivir may have a higher genetic barrier to drug resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two clinical trials conducted by the University Hospitals of Cleveland, one in people with moderate disease and one in people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of vitamin C, which is administered intravenously to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, are underway; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials of the antibiotic, azithromycin, on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) has planned a clinical trial of the inhaled corticosteroid dezinin alvescocin (cyclosonide) for asthma, which could be used to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A phase II trial of angiodentine-transfer enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria, with 200 patients selected from hospitalized patients with severe exposure to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
In the study, named COLCORONA, 6000 adults aged 40 and above were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced moderate symptoms without hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are ineligible.
Many blood clotting inhibitors are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which is why the Italian Medicines Agency has issued guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium at doses required for immunization and therapy was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen, much scientific attention has been focused on the re-development of approved antimicrobials developed for previous unexpected diseases such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ripavirin: Reviews of China 7 suggested that Ripavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19
Umifenovir: recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to China's 7th Review
Some of the antibiotics identified as reusable for treatment of COVID-19 are:
Dosilisumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Trials in Italy and China. See also Dosilismap#COVID-19.
The Beta A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was not expected to be available for 18 months.
In the first phase of safety trials in April, there were five vaccines as the selection.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A severe outbreak of NAV worldwide in 2020 led to substantial investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Several companies are using already released genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI noted that speed, productivity, large scale implementation and global access are imperative in vaccine discovery initiatives.
CEPI scientists reported in April that 10 different technological research sites and processes are in progress to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19 by early 2020.
The main basic objectives advanced in the Phase I safety studies are:
Uterine (DNA and RNA) (phase I development and vaccine study: Moderna, also known as Uterine (milk RNA - mRNA-1273)
The microbe is a carrier (stage I developer and vaccine: Cancino Biologies, Adenobacterium type 5 carrier)
A total of 115 vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 active projects have been confirmed (according to Milken's data), and 37 have been notified, but little public information is available (planning or thought to be in the works), CEPI scientists announced in April.
Phase I-II trials are generally randomized, drug-free, controlled and multi-site pre-security and immunity testing to determine the most accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including a control group, and include monitoring of the trial efficacy of the vaccine to prevent disease, while also monitoring adverse effects from the dose of the drug given at the optimal dose.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in functional development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 are not yet involved in human evaluation studies (still in ""preclinical"" research)".
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify pathogenic proteins to induce an immune response.

Moderna, Keurvag, Inovayo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland are other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal trials of six different vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the communication from China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on clinical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine discovery initiatives at Canadian institutions and universities, including the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Chicago.
"At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which it plans to establish a national 'vaccine bank' consisting of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine tested a potential COVID-19 vaccine called BitcoVac in mice, and claimed that 'the MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 adjuvant vaccine demonstrates potent anti-microbial effects [in mice] that are resistant to specific immunity, which begin to become apparent 2 weeks after immunization.' "
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced that it was developing a DNA-based vaccine as a nasal spray.
Using microorganisms, the DNA is designed to create harmless pathogen-like particles within human bacteria that could stimulate the immune system to form antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprises, along with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, joined forces with cloud computing, the US government, industry, and three universities to mobilize resources from IBM to access supercomputers.
Some vaccines have side effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means they can get benefits beyond the disease they can prevent.
In Australia, a further randomized trial is seeking to recruit 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines in development are likely to be neither safe nor effective.
Early research to evaluate vaccine efficacy using coronavirus COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human animals indicates the need for safety level 3 control measures and international coordination for handling live pathogens to ensure standardised safety practices.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protection vaccine for SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
While MERS was widely practiced, it is hoped that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three trials are underway, all of which are pathogen-transmitting vaccines, two are adenobutyric pathogen-transmitters (ChAdOx1-MERS, PVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-transmitter (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promote conspiracy theories that the virus behind COVID-19 has been discovered and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts, including patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other variants of the coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV-2.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from infection to the first symptom is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most infections produce mild symptoms, some progress toward pathogenic pneumonia and multi-cellular dysfunction.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 5,68,000 people have been cured. The virus is spread primarily through close contact with humans, usually through coughing, sneezing, or small droplets that appear during speech.
These tumors form during exhalation, and usually fall to the ground or surface rather than being contagious over long distances.
Human infection can be transmitted by contact with the eyes, nose or mouth after contact with an infected surface.
The bacteria can survive for up to 72 hours on the surface.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it is possible to spread before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is real-time retrograde transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal patch.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Most countries in the WHO six regions have recorded local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or may have cold-blooded symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty getting up, and a blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms occur.
Rarely, upper respiratory symptoms such as nausea, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially limited to chest tightness and photophobia.
In some patients, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 (the time interval between onset of symptoms) is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Not all people who develop symptoms are reported to be infected.
The role of these asymptomatic vectors in transmission is not yet fully understood, and preliminary evidence suggests that they may also contribute to transmission.
The proportion of people who are asymptomatic despite infection is currently unknown and is under study, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed patients were asymptomatic while hospitalized.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily infection count on April 1, and of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both the feces and the saliva carry high levels of viruses.
Talking out loud can produce more bankruptcies than talking out of the box.
Studies have shown that when the mouth is not closed, the echidnas can travel up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally learned, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors installed in halls outside people's rooms provided positive samples of the virus's RNA.
Some medical procedures such as tubal infusion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can spray the airways, causing toxic air to be released.
Although there are concerns that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although it is possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, one person typically infects two to three people, with the virus surviving on surfaces for hours to several days.
Specifically, one day on the cardboard, up to three days on polypropylene and steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this can vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Even soap and detergent are effective if used properly; soap products break down the fat-protecting layer of the pathogen, deactivating it, and freeing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solvents such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) were less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after admission to the hospital.
For five of the six patients, the first sample showed higher viruses, and the sixth patient showed higher viruses on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated in Wuhan from three people with pneumonia associated with severe respiratory cluster disease.
All the features of coronaviruses in nature are present in the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which causes its protective bubble to burst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The organs most affected by COVID-19 are the lungs, as the virus reaches the host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The pathogen uses a unique exoskeleton called a pepelomer to communicate with ACE2 and enter another cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of hospitalized patients were diagnosed with severe heart failure, and this is often seen in severe cases.
There are high rates of cardiac symptoms due to organ-mediated anti-inflammatory and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but severe myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 infection have been found to have higher incidence of venous thrombosis (31%) and capillary thrombophobia (25%), and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsy of those who died due to COVID-19 shows diffuse alveolar damage (DAD-AD-DAD), and lymphatic drainage with lymph nodes.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has an induction affinity for the respiratory tract's ACE2-expressing epithelial cells, severe COVID-19 patients have organ hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, T-cell-minerating pathogen GM-CSF has been shown to be associated with single-cell-minerating IL-6 inflammation and severe pulmonary disease in COVID-19 patients.
The autopsy reported penetrations into the lymph nodes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is the real-time retrospective transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
Typically the test is done on respiratory samples obtained from a nasophrenial pancreas; however, a nasal pancreas or cochlear sample may also be used.
Results usually come within a few hours to a couple of days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of coronavirus and released the genome sequence, so laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection caused by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect existing infections and whether a person has had infection in the past) were in progress but not yet widely used.
The experimental experience of the Chinese shows that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhangnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommended methods for diagnosing infections based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bipartite polymorphic surface-to-glass reflection with outer, asymmetrical and posterior distribution is common in early infection.
There may be blepharitis dominance, inverse respiratory (thickening of the interstitial with varying vesicular fillers), and strengthening as the disease progresses.
Some information is available on microbeads and the pathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy:
Physiological examination: pneumonia, heartburn, hardening of the lungs and pneumonia
The four types of viral pneumonia can be distinguished:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, pneumocyst hyperplasia, secondary inflammation with large differentiated lymphocytes, lymphocytic penetration and the formation of a multi-nuclear giant cell
Severe pneumonia: Transmissible alveolar leakage with transmissible alveolar damage (TAD).
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute anemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: structure of leaks in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary intermediate fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intracranial clotting (DIC); reaction to increased white blood cell count
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a dish while coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the knee if no dish is available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
To control the spread by asymptomatic individuals, the CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of affected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include that people should stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No drug is effective in preventing COVID-19 As soon as possible but not until 2021 as a vaccine can be expected, the key to managing COVID-19 is to slow the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are dirty, before eating, and after blowing one's nose, sneezing, or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not immediately available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not immediately available, the WHO offers two locally produced formulas.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial seeds in alcohol; it is ""not the active ingredient for hand antiseptics"."
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, resuscitation, and support for other critical organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxidation (ECMO), has been used to address the problem of respiratory distress, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supplemental therapies may be useful for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
Experts from the Intensive Care Unit and pulmonologists from the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various organizations in the free resource IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the spread of the virus, especially during procedures where sanitary systems can release feces such as ductwork or use of hand-operated ventilators.
The CDC recommends that healthcare providers who are caring for people with COVID-19 should keep one person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIR) in addition to the use of standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions.
Recommended equipment: PPE pads, respirators or masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. Respirators (instead of masks) are recommended if available.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial applications, but masks have been approved by the FDA for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but there is no guarantee of efficacy against a specific biological agent for unauthorized use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of masks or, lastly, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 patients do not have a severe condition requiring artificial respiration or alternatives, but a certain percentage do.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory disorders is being actively studied with some evidence that inpatients with high-flow nasal cannula or bi-state positive airway pressure may be avoided.
It is not known whether the two offer the same benefit to the seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer perforated mechanical ventilation when available, because this technology controls the spread of particulate matter compared to a high-flow nasal tube (hyflow nasal cannula). Acute infection is most commonly seen in older people (over 60 years of age, and more particularly over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds for individuals, limiting the capacity of health systems to handle the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of people were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilation assistance, and 1.4% had died.
In China, 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more complicated as the development of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 and oxidation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure control systems and high PEEP-capable artificial respirators are needed to reduce the risk of ventilation-related pulmonary injury and pneumothoracic pneumoconiosis (Pneumothorax) and increase biogas delivery.
The old ventilators may not have high PEEP.
The study of potential treatments started in January 2020 and various antimicrobials are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems very promising.
While it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antibiotics may be tried in severe patients.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) participate in efficacy and safety trials of potential treatments. The FDA has granted provisional authorization for disinfected fecal matter as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect close contact with surveillance data and thus detect the possibility of infection.
Each user can check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-isolation if the possibility of infection is detected, but also alerts local health authorities. Mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location tracking and artificial intelligence help to detect infected humans and who they may have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government helped security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people with the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with affected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared integrated telephone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is using facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
'Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Calera said he was informed by mobile phone service providers that '40% of the population is constantly moving around.'
The German government hosted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonia's President Kirsty Galijulai has called for a solution from around the world to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience agony from isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
BBC's Rory O'Connor pointed out that 'increasing social exclusion, isolation, health concerns, stress and economic downturn are the perfect storm to damage people's mental and physical health.'
The disease may take a moderate course with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.
Moderate cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with already severe or complicated illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but data for COVID-19 is limited. In some individuals, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In those who are severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to Acute Respiratory Deficiency Syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, neurological trauma or multiple organ failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include blood poisoning, abnormal clotting and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Abnormal clots, particularly prolonged prothrombin time, were described in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of these patients had abnormal renal function.
About 20-30% of those arriving with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death is ten days, of which five days are spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have an average of seven days between admission to the hospital and death.
In the early incidence study, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, and for women, 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of pulmonary samples in autopsy show multiple damage that can be transmitted with cellular fibromyxide leakage in both lungs.
The pneumocytes were found to have bacterial-induced cellular changes.
The picture of the lung was similar to that of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
The National Health Commission of China reported that increased levels of troponin and cardiac arrest, including heart attack, were observed in 11.8% of deaths.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations had pre-existing medical conditions. Availability of medical resources and socioeconomics of a region can also affect mortality.
Because of those regional differences, but also because of the systemic problems, mortality estimates differ from this state.
Not counting the number of mild cases would make the mortality rate overstated.
However, the fact that there are deaths as a result of past infections may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term continuation of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found that some recovering patients had a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity, and recommended that lung transplants be done to damage the organ.
This can lead to post-intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether it provides effective and long-lasting immunity to people recovering from past infections.
Immunity is seen as possible based on behaviour of other coronaviruses, but it has been reported that those who have recovered from COVID-19 have later tested positive for coronaviruses.
These patients are believed to be in the progression of a prolonged infection rather than a re-infection.
The pathogen is natural and is thought to have originated from animals through direct infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the disease was almost entirely human-to-human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 revealed the initial date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official releases by the World Health Organization (WHO) saw early signs on 8 December 2019.
There are many methods used to calculate mortality in general.
These numbers vary by region and time period, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as testing volume, quality of health system, treatment choices, time from initial infection and age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes as U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically detected COVID-19 deaths without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio between death and infection reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of infections detected over a given time interval.
The global case-to-death ratio is 6.9% (1,53,822/2,24,0191) as of 17 April 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Other measures include infectious mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed persons dying from a disease, and infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed and undiagnosed persons dying from a disease.
These figures are not chronological and the method of diagnosis is to follow a specific group of people who have been infected.
Although not all infected individuals develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people are infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, 4,60,080 (1.7%) people have already died in the small village of Castigillion de Ada.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through carnival festivals, spread to the younger generation, caused relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths were classified.
And the German health system is not very good.
An estimated 3% of blood donors in the Netherlands may have immunity.
69 (0.004%) of the population have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the disease and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
In studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate was higher among men.
For men, the risk is higher when they are in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only closer to 90s.
China's mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender-differentiation are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Sex-based immune differences, lower smoking rates among women, and the development of disease conditions such as high blood pressure in men at a younger age than women may be responsible for higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died with COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track sex-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
The official name of the disease is "COVID-19" as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus, D stands for disease, and 19 stands for 31 December 2019, when the outbreak was first identified.
The name is named in accordance with the International Recommendation for Prevention of Discriminatory Naming to avoid referring to a specific geographical area (e.g. China), animal species or group of people. The most severe respiratory syndrome for the virus that causes COVID-19 is coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both disease and pathogen are commonly referred to as coronaviruses.
During the early outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the names 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 Guidelines against the use of place names for diseases and pathogens.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in common supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing sanitary products such as nasal wipes and artificial respirators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in urgent need of a ventilator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in time, a local startup re-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the web.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of tracing of the pathogen in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a 'compatibility trial' to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four well-functioning antimicrobial compounds based on existing efficacy".
No vaccine is available at present, but several companies are actively working on developing a vaccine.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being explored.
First, the researchers aim to develop a complete vaccine against the pathogen.
The use of such a pathogen is aimed at demonstrating the human body's immunity against a new infection of COVID-19, whether it is inactivated or dead.
The second strategy, sub-stage vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subgroups of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or RNA vaccines, a modern technology for vaccine production).
These strategies are derived from the need for experimental vaccines to be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine has a harmless genetic code copied from the pathogen. Immunodeficiency has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is debatable.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluate treatments for malaria already approved, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The Chinese studies are largely targeted antimicrobials, with the results of nine phase III trials on Remdivir expected by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug contributors was in place until April 2020. Current antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ridonavir and lopinavir/interferon beta-conjugated ritonavir.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of efficacy of remdesivirol.
Patients treated with unapproved remdesivir have seen clinical improvement.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer re-evaluation of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Microbiology recommends a daily dose of one gram, which is twice as dangerous and potentially fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. China's 7th edition guidelines include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in an objective manner.
Nitazoxanide was further recommended in the VIVO study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early spleen protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (DMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry by interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without azithromycin are subject to a high threshold, preventing the medical world from accepting them without further studies. Oseltamivir does not objectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytotoxin storm may be a problem in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-resistant storm properties. Dosilezumab has been included in the treatment guidelines of the National Health Commission of China based on a small study.
It is undergoing a 2-phase randomized trial nationwide in Italy after showing positive results in patients with severe disease.
Combining Ferit's blood test with a serum to identify cytokine storms is one of the few advances that has been credited with causing the deaths of some of the victims.
In 2017, the FDA approved the Interleukin-6 receptor based on retrospective studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, another cause called CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that docylisomab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transplantation of purified and enriched antibodies produced by the immune systems of COVID-19 survivors to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine alternative to immunization.
This strategy was tried on Charles with uncertain results.
Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antiprotein therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms such as antiprotein-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or pacositosis are possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using synthetic antibodies, are in progress.
The liquid portion of blood taken from recovered patients and the production of disinfected feces containing a specific antibody to this pathogen may be increased for rapid application.
Coronavirus, a group of closely related pathologies
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
