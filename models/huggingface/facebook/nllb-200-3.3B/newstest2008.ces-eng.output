Inflation in Europe has skyrocketed because of food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November price growth in the 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1% recorded in October after 2.6%, the Union Statistical Office in Luxembourg reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the base rate, saying that a reduction, combined with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below 2%, but close to that.
One analyst said that the ECB was in an absurd situation: it had to "prevent" inflation so that it would not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent was a 15-year high; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has soared due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
Wheat futures rose 88 percent, and the soybean price reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007, edible oil and dairy products had to be paid significantly more.
The price of oil on world markets has risen 52 percent this year, and last month a barrel of black gold was already selling for nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump to 2.5% in 2008 from 2.1% in 2008 but will already fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts expect inflation to remain at around 3 percent for the next three to four months, but at an average annual rate of 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The support base for Fidesz has grown significantly since its initial stagnation in early December, and it now has the largest support base since 2002, while the Socialists have never had such low support as the -13% that the Gallup Institute has measured.
For some party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support versus one-fifth support for the MSZP.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entry to parliament, according to the survey: their support within the population is two percent.
Among some party voters, the two sides are one percent more likely to support each other.
Public opinion of the economy has also deteriorated from the previous low - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad been so high - 41 percent, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about their material situation after the more hopeful outlook of spring and summer.
As for next year, most of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, the highest number of any Gallup poll to date, said the prime minister was doing a bad job rather than a good job.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is trusted or very trusted by 13 percent of those surveyed, while Viktor Orbán's share of supporters is 38 percent.
The Prime Minister is not trusted at all by 54 percent, the leader of the Fidesz movement by 27 percent.
One of the indicators of the political situation is how much of the public believes that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While 35 percent of those who had considered the continuation of the government and the prime minister desirable after last October's unrest, this number is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in calling new elections.
Significantly, 60 percent of respondents said they would certainly attend the referendum and another 20 percent said they would probably attend.
For comparison, only 55 percent would definitely participate in "parliamentary elections this Sunday" and another 15 percent consider their participation likely.
School fees would be 74 percent, doctor fees 79 percent, and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same percentages only in the circle of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of tuition, doctor's fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth over Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs Triangle retained last year's average price level of 16% with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Article from the Napi Gazdaság newspaper
The usual Christmas shopping basket of Napi Gazdaság newspaper in the Budauer shopping triangle has increased by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price has increased by more than a thousand forints.
Since food prices in supermarkets "surged" last December, the percentage increase was not as drastic as the previous high base.
But it is certainly unpleasant for the consumer that what he could buy for less than nine thousand forints last year, he cannot buy for ten thousand.
The daily economy shopping basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of 10 000 forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the cost of a basket was HUF 6,800.)
The price of Unica and live fish has stayed almost at last year's level, but the price of breast, nuts and poppy have gone up.
The prices of bread and flour were in line with the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilo of bread for 139 forints.
The competition didn't go below 200 forints.
Also surprising in this store was the fact that the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola in a return bottle was under 200 forints, so even with the deposit the product cost only 257 forints.
However, according to the Napi Gazdaság daily's consumption basket, Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices in the Napi Gazdaság shopping cart have increased by 15 percent compared to last year's Christmas sales of Cora, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by approximately 18 percent.
When you compare last year's high and this year's low, the difference between the low and the high was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's low and this year's high is 21 percent.
In forints, the average increase was 1,480
The average price increase last year was HUF 1 206 with prices affected by the VAT increase at Christmas.
This process has disrupted trade, and the trading houses have clearly been unable to decide how wide a price range to set for each product, since they have been unable to predict the effect of changes in prices on consumption.
(If a trader plans the turnover rate of a given product poorly, significant profits may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the turnover intensity.)
Because of the VAT, the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket last year was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was HUF 1,720 higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was HUF 844.
This year, the extreme difference was not apparent, the most expensive basket was now 1630 forints more than last year and the cheapest basket was also 1,284 forints more expensive.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, the price increase was catastrophic, with daily groceries in supermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, among other things, is not absolutely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office data: it measured price increases of more than 30 percent over 12 months for several staple foods.
In addition to flour, for example, eggs.)
In the latter case, however, this seems almost impossible according to the Daily Economy's consumption basket, since the price level of the product, already quite expensive last year, showed a price increase of barely 10% in the worst case, compared to the base.
Flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have managed to push through the drastic price increases in international chains.
The hypermarkets in the Golden Triangle of Commerce aren't complaining, they're still reporting a good year.
In our experience, most customers in the three stores we visited no longer care about prices.
They buy everything in quantity, take perishables for a fee.
On Wednesday morning, long lines were formed at the checkout counters in all three supermarkets because of the surge in the number of visitors.
But as we know, the rural areas have lower revenues, and many international chains have complained to research firms that sales are falling short of their plans, not only for food but also for durable consumer goods.
Many places are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand hospital infections were reported, mostly due to inappropriate antibiotic use.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowded beds, overcrowded personnel to contain the disease are not helping, says the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, too, disinfectants are being used sparingly.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who was admitted to hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient has been isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place earlier this year.
A patient who had been injured in a serious car accident was discharged, but soon afterward he was returned with MRSA infection, and a major operation had not yet been performed because of the bacteria in his system.
As of December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröczová, a senior official at the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, others are not known.
Almost two thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by one third of the population through the nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. strep throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, morning infections) respond well to antibiotics and are well treatable.
However, if antibiotics are over- or inappropriately administered, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics will develop into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and that spread rapidly in unsuitable hospital conditions.
In particular, in the case of temporary or permanent immune dysfunction in patients with weakened bodies, low body weight or in elderly patients, it can cause serious hospital infections such as morning infections or sepsis.
According to the chief medical officer of St. John's, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, as it is a common practice in hospitals.
"Infection must not be confused with epidemic, MRSA is not the only place", declared Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of a disease-causing agent is not investigated".
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the nursing staff treats them in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to hospital are first tested for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is out of fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions in domestic hospitals are not conducive to preventing the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection is symptomatically present in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients admitted and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not a new trend in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund this investigation also plays a role.
Most cases are detected when the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the epidemiology center's primary investigator.
The European Union has strict guidelines for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, pathology.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotic therapy or to conduct microbiological testing to prevent the development of drug resistance, but this is not always the case in hospitals.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system of controls on the use of the euro in the healthcare sector.
Saves on disinfectants
Scientific evidence suggests that MRSA is most commonly transmitted to patients through healthcare personnel.
So handwashing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but even in this there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and contact, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in home hospital settings.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close together, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, unfortunately, hospitals with a poor financial situation often lack disinfectants, few nurses, and many patients, thus increasing the risk of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are observed, there is a demonstrable reduction in similar infections or further spread of the disease-causing organism can be stopped.
The government's MRSA program
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has set up a programme to prevent MRSA, or to reduce its incidence.
The programme seems to be successful, as the published data shows that MRSA infections in England are on the decline.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified as a priority the prevention of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII district who caused the fatal accident is finished.
It is impossible that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, informed the spokesman of the High State Representative Office of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert assessment of the case was completed.
The forensic assessment confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which had already established that the former police captain had no alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then-Director of the XXII District Police Department, on Tuesday, in the street Lajos Kossuth in the XXII District, hit a man of fifty-five, who had stepped in front of him, crossing the road outside the marked crossing, with his own car, while turning the corner.
(The latter fact of the pedestrian crossing the crossing is not an extenuating circumstance, according to the rules of the road, the turning car must still give priority.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
The incident led to the district police chief resigning and requesting a transfer to a retirement position, reportedly because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with the prosecutors carrying out the investigation from the beginning.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totalling EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Marta Gajecka.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a framework of EUR 300 million for the budget financing of transport and environment projects supported by the Cohesion Fund in Hungary, with the parties having already concluded a loan agreement for EUR 100 million, the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement of €150 million is also used to finance the budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose, with the remaining EUR 150 million available for use at a later date, subject to the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which will be used primarily for the Debrecen University's R&D project.
The meeting also included talk of the 4th Metro line.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how to modify the original contract.
According to Janos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary since 1990 for 113 projects.
The EIB's eight-year loan facility, with no commitment fee, is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - the attention of all Europe is turning to the previously slightly neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying in the EU's ever-cheapest but fast-growing market?
The analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and seaside villas, is now without doubt the most sought-after East European destination for property purchases.
The mountains are the most in the course area of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast Albena, Zlaté Piesky, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later investors will also be interested in the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are also buying in the surroundings of the cheap city of Ruse.
The capital Sofia also promises attractive opportunities, with commercial and office space offering the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golfing paradises, becoming a popular destination for the next two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-looking investors are already buying in bulk, for example in the Banska area.
According to analysts, property buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
The largest number of customers comes from England, but there are also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and, increasingly, Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Yankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication, and they are close to the big city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is that of the cottage-buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
Real estate auctions in the capital are continuous, as demand is growing stronger and stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, yet it has grown by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly outpacing the growth in wages.
Fedor and Hungarian six percent
According to Minister of Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, expert meetings will end on Tuesday and the post-2012 international climate conference will continue with ministerial discussions after the official opening on Wednesday.
Experts and policymakers from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which addresses the efforts following the emissions reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States also said it did not want to negotiate precise figures at this time, although it is committed to a deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another big question at the conference is whether developed countries will agree to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that rely on them, in addition to reducing emissions.
The agreement also established subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, set up by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member steering committee, presumably within the framework of the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Hungarian six percent
The Minister for the Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, has supported Hungary's efforts to maintain the EU's leadership role in global climate protection and to help forge a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, irrespective of the success of the 'post-2012 agreement', and is ready to commit to reductions of up to 30 per cent if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to take on responsibilities and commitments commensurate with their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set a reduction target of 5.2%, while the then 15 EU Member States committed to 8%.
Hungary's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87 is a reality. - as stated in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
Bali is a big deal, because an international agreement on long-term climate change policy must be adopted within two years, or its entry into force would be postponed until 2012. In such a case, the reduction commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new emission reduction system, the necessity of which was also pointed out by the UN's International Panel on Climate Change - the Nobel Peace Prize winner - in its latest report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and inevitably increase the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is conducting a recruitment on YouTube
British military units are posting on a video sharing server footage of their actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to promote themselves.
YouTube first caught the eye of the RAF: Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of anti-Taliban actions since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The footage, taken by a miniature camera attached to a helmet, is monitored by the air force command operating combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent on to London, where it is broadcast on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 recordings of British airmen have been posted online, and their "channel" has been viewed by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Facility in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployed in Afghanistan
The Air Force has released videos of its original intent for recruitment, and according to the Department of Defense, they are also good at informing the general public about the true purpose of the military presence overseas.
"The advertisement in this form costs next to nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads", said Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert, to the BBC, "but it also necessarily carries a political message, as it confirms the legitimacy of military action decided by the government".
The Americans made a play
The army is concerned that besides the carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also being uploaded to the server, depicting the death of soldiers, for example: in a somewhat hypocritical, "official" promotional film, officers talk about losses, but do not show the bloody aspect of the battle.
There's a lot of video on the internet of the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, of the heavy deployments, but the British military have only just discovered them.
The Americans do the recruiting a little differently - with a free-to-download shooter called America's Army, in which the player can get into the soldiers' skin through a more or less faithful simulation.
The ministries will have a Christmas with a lottery and pay-checks
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is apparently not being sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she is holding a final work meeting for her colleagues, at which they will say goodbye to 2007 with cupcakes and coffee.
Some ministries will have a party with live music, others will be a party with a toast and a toast to the Christmas spirit.
The party, the Christmas spirit, the concerts and the buffet - that's how the powerful have fun.
The government is also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive Christmas celebration of the year will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence, but not by its employees.
On Christmas Day, the orphans receive gifts from the children of fallen soldiers, on Mission Christmas they host family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions, but they also host a reception for journalists.
The resort is donating $25 million to the end-of-year atmosphere.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are the ones that are going to get the most out of the other resorts.
The GKM party is being held in the Jövő Háza centre, at a total cost of HUF 4,320,000, and some 350 guests are expected from the ministry's 600 staff.
The resort will keep to its Christmas traditions, but will also have a variety of performances and a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4 700 000 forints and took place on Wednesdays in the State Council of Justice (OIT) building - the programme included concerts and dinners.
The rental cost of the hall was one million forints, the rest being spent on more than four hundred guests.
It seems that one of the NFÜ's departments is invited to another Christmas party: the company that organises the tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG), with EU funds.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház theatre.
MAG a.s. did not confirm this information as we were unable to reach the person concerned.
The suit is not necessary.
The ILO building was not only the NFÜ's home, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security's, which instead of Christmas held the St. Lucia ball on 7 December.
But he did not ask the ILO for money to use its wards.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with a welcome to the minister, and after dinner, there was live music and dancing.
According to the [origo] portal's answer to the question, there was no dress code or evening gown at all.
The Puritan party is being hosted by the Departments of Health, Labor and Local Government.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a 400,000 forint program and celebration for employees in its own building.
Labour Minister Monica Lampert doesn't even officially invite her colleagues to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
There are 180 guests, who according to the press department will only receive coffee and cigarettes, so the party will only cost 350,000 forints.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues are simply having a drink in the lobby of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is holding a Christmas party, with 436 employees expected to attend, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party, he's donating 2,500 forints per guest - the total includes a reception with buffet tables and a toast.
Since János Veres became minister, the PM's staff has celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
The party atmosphere will be lacking, however, the formality is enhanced not only by the minister's speech, but also by the afternoon session.
The Agricultural Resort is holding a New Year's reception on January 20th, and the Ministry Christmas is not taking place.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Palace, and according to the Ministry, 1,000 forints per person will be allocated for 100 guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief greeting from the Minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the relevant press department told the portal.
The price of the Christmas celebration was not disclosed by the Environment Department in the press department.
Anyway, 400 people were invited to a party at the Museum of Arts and Industry.
It's coming up to a giant strike.
The League of Trade Unions and the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ) will form their strike committee on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike for an indefinite period.
There's a protest rally on Saturday, and a work stoppage on Monday, the final day of the health care bill vote.
The action will certainly cause serious disruption to transport, as almost all rail transport will be stopped and the employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike by 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League and the National Union of Workers' Councils will announce the details of the joint strike on Monday.
A strike committee will be formed to coordinate the action.
On Saturday, there's a public protest meeting, and on Monday, the unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that there is no date set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance bill.
If the health insurance bill is not passed by Parliament, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike.
However, if the legislation is voted down, the strike committee will meet and decide on the next step.
The Monday agenda of the Parliament also allows for the health insurance bill to be voted on late in the evening or at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, there are likely to be major disruptions to transportation: work on the railway will be stopped indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of Volán's companies may stop in the morning.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half the roadways will also be closed.
The call for the strike was joined by numerous unions and civil organizations, whose list is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations have called for an indefinite strike, others have declared temporary stoppages.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) had failed to agree on adequate services, while more and more people are traveling by rail at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the previous announcements, there will be a strike at the BKV from the beginning of the operation until 1 pm, from 7 am to 9 am at the Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike organized by the Trade Unions of the Energy Industry LIGA, for 2-, respectively 2-8 hours of work stoppage called by the Trade Union of Educators and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators.
The Hungarian doctors' union will strike alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Union of Healthcare and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw its health insurance reform proposal and present a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions be introduced gradually from next year.
Third, to ensure that early retirement for the relevant occupational fields is possible before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), which is part of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding the railway branches and is waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
The Hungarian Guard, which was founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several ways, according to the Risk Analysing Division of the Political Capital Institute.
The 'risk warning' prepared by the firm states that the biggest political risk in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that 'the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary may escalate into violent ethnic clashes in the short term'.
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke such an action - adds the research institute.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the biggest neglects of Hungarian political representatives: "the public debate on the Roma issue was left by representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contradiction".
This exacerbates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, empowers extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict, the institute said.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, influenced by the great attention of both domestic and foreign media, "to a considerable extent have damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
As part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has been receiving increasing publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, several organizations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007, calling themselves "national defense" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in case of natural disasters, invasion of the homeland, disorder), in addition to referring to the incompetence of the police, army, or state", he adds.
He also notes that all this is done in a way that tries to pack all kinds of political efforts based on society's resistance to politics and parties into civilian clothes.
The emphasis on the civil character and form of the association thus serves not only to avoid the legal obstacles of judicial registration but also as a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-increasing factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been identified in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, and the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighboring countries have sought to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies by invoking the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this may affect the political stability of the region", he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, which has increased political risks for the region as a whole.
The Hungarian Guard's activities, he writes, are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of Sofia's neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
BNU used this to establish the Guard with the aim of the organization being "national defense".
For the past 17 years, she says, Bulgaria has experienced "gypsy terror" but the state has remained passive and indifferent, notes the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has provoked a stormy discussion among the Bulgarian public.
The increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they will form their own guard in response to the sign of resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far bear similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own national defence, as we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
He said they publish a risk analysis every year and if they find something that could affect the risk change, they inform the public, like in this case by issuing a risk alert.
The holidays aren't free everywhere
In Hungary, the days of rest are precisely defined by law and it has become a common practice to move the working days around holidays, which we will see less of in the coming year.
The holidays are not uniform in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and days of rest.
The days of rest are usually associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is a working holiday - for the New Year so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
We have a total of eleven holidays during the year.
National holidays are March 15, celebrating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, the day of remembrance of the Revolution of 1956.
August 20th is the anniversary of the founding of the state, May 1st is the anniversary of the labor movement, November 1st and 2nd is the anniversary of the death of relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day holidays, Easter, Christmas and Christmas.
Since our national, state or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day forward in cases where we would only work one day before or after a holiday.
The price of extended weekends, of course, is that we stay at work and school the Saturday before.
The date on which we work the day immediately preceding or following the holiday has been regulated for many years by a special decree of the Minister of Labour.
The law applies equally to all employers and their employees, to public servants and to persons in public service.
However, it does not apply to firms and institutions which are in continuous operation or which, for reasons of their purpose, are also working on non-working days.
This year, the working schedule will change only around the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to previous experience, most people will "work" or use the days between Christmas and New Year in advance.
Next year, we're going to have a number of our holidays in the middle of the week, or on the weekend, so there's going to be less of a shift in the workday than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is changed around Labor Day so that workers can stay home for four days straight.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2nd, may be a day of rest.
The next move is due to the holiday of October 23: Saturday, October 18, will be working instead of Friday, October 24.
But the end of the year next year will be able to go entirely in the sign of the holidays, because from December 24th they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays, even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six intimidating little things you can do to annoy your coworkers
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we barely notice anymore: all of these add to the everyday workplace.
The question is, do you get used to these little nuisances, or do you put on gloves and deliberately avoid ambiguous situations that might upset others?
The tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you, they wanted you in the marketing department", a colleague tells you.
That you missed the meeting because of this?
At best, he regrets it and tries to rectify the situation, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to deliver the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's solved with an apology.
Before embarrassing excuses are made, it is good to think about what you could do to make your colleagues uncomfortable, and consciously try to prevent it.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than reaching for a piece of paper, or an office needle, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find a pen on a colleague's desk that you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they will rightly be angry with you for going through their things.
Do not take envelopes or paper clips from the office, as it may be uncomfortable to run out prematurely and you will need them immediately.
Gossip about the private lives of colleagues?
There's no good solution to stopping the spread of rumors.
Who, who, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don't tell everyone your stories about the private lives of your colleagues!
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Keep what you have heard to yourself, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his affairs.
You're reporting your absence without cause?
If you call the office and report an absentee because you are not feeling well or because you think you would rather rest today, remember that your work, urgent tasks and tasks with a deadline, will have to be done for you by someone else.
Be respectful of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not be going to work the next day, or that something may happen that will require you to stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and supervisors are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
The cuddling, the giggling, the phone calls.
You're immersed in a job that's being taken out of your life by the grinning of your colleagues?
Did you witness a phone conversation that you'd rather not hear?
Do not disturb your coworkers with whining, singing, loud talking (overhead), or tapping, constant whining, loud discontent.
All of this can be distracting even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If you are not on time or have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Don't rely on the chaos of the office and the noise of your colleagues!
Admit when you've made a mistake and someone has paid for it, and make amends!
Ask how you can make things right, correct a mistake!
Does the office feel too much like home?
Flip-flops and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don't wear clothes for leisure, even if your profession allows it!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in casual attire - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When you want to please, you're not interesting
Traffic jams in the usual morning traffic.
The radio has a special melody: the sound of a violin accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm increasing the volume.
The music changes the tempo, adding a bass to the previous tone coloring, then the female chorus joins in as a real gem.
The station mr2 is playing a song by the band Zagar called Wings of Love.
The music life at home hasn't exactly spoiled us with high-end electronic pop for a long time.
Suddenly, the traffic jam looks completely different because you're listening to Zagaru's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboy, a new and exciting product from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the landscape, and while garage rock is back in style with its guitar-slashing, home electropop is proving that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pětikostelí and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until finally - perhaps because two dudas don't fit into one chord - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through, only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The film is based on the novel by Ference Török ("Sezon").
His band, which played in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience after wan2 magazine named their first album of 2002 one of the 50 most important domestic records and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as almost the only domestic entity determining developments that could be marketed in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "on the course", although of course no one has asked them if they are happy with this label.
The band reacted as they should: they made a new, better album.
The newly released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new paths for them, although the title itself tries to create a continuity with the early years in the Five Star.
It's a line from a song by the old band Balázs Zságera.
The reference to ethereal, flying would have been appropriate, but alongside the ethereal breath of this music now appeared - in keeping with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, influenced by rock and roll.
In these songs, the record's premiere in Millenáris Park featured singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the band The Puzzle.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music from morning to night, the song Wings of Love, recorded with six local singers ("Underground Divas"), began to linger.
So everything is fine.
The portal hvg.hu has interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: With this new hit, the question is, how much of what you play is still marginal music?
The definition of peripheral music means nothing to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music: not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, say nothing, and just as it can be created just for the sake of selling, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can be born of a sincere inner need.
This is the spirit in which the attitude is expressed, regardless of language or national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
Z.s.: In foreign countries, especially in the West, light music has a larger tradition.
The concerts are not just for teenagers and people in their 20s, but also for older people.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music that are happening around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and how many people listen to your music?
ZS: Of course, it's a good feeling that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a purpose, but with a reason.
The role of the audience is felt more in concerts, where the influence is already there, but it is only hidden in the unattainable transformations of the moment.
But I've noticed that when you try to please the audience, you become less interesting.
How far are you going to follow Yonderboy's example?
He's a solo artist, and he's built his career out west of us.
BZ: We don't really go his way, regardless of how our music is sometimes tried to explain.
We're more like team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work would be compared to the Yonderboie, for several of us had left his band and taken a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love was the number one song on the mr2 Petőfi chart.
Many of you first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did the more popular style consciously open you up to a wider range of people?
BZ: We didn't plan on writing a hit that would sell an album.
There's more to the song.
We intended it to be the finale of the album, where we tried to release the previous sonic orgy and more complex themes.
How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it -- what was the guiding principle?
BZ: The idea was to create a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to form this choir of female soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So we put together this six-piece choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then renamed the Underground Divas.
Is that exactly how you intended the song to be, or did the girls make something up?
BZs.: The song had already existed in an instrumental version for a long time, and when the material was collected on the record, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
The chord progression was designed to be accompanied by a chorus.
That night, I sang a tune to him that the girls later learned.
It all came out almost at first and awfully spontaneously.
I remember how it came alive, but of course, it took the Divas to do it.
It wouldn't work with my voice as energetic.
Both on the record and at the concert, it seemed like there were girls in the background.
They don't have any solos, they don't have any parts, they sing together and they don't sound louder than the music, so the music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were also backstage.
You mean that on purpose?
BZ: They were only behind because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to give out the solo parts is deliberate.
And this song is about us forgetting our egos, where we come from, where we belong, and just letting ourselves be lifted up by those wings, the wings of love.
I wish that the euphoria we felt when that song was born could be felt by others.
Which one did you do the most work with?
BZ: When I was composing music, I didn't really do it with one, the heavier pieces were more like mixing.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play the concert violin, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't work for a long time, then everything slowly found its place like a jigsaw puzzle.
Which song from the new album is your favorite?
BZ: It's always changing with the concert and the fact that I've already "released" the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The rogue broker risked billions from worthlessness
A known fraud.
That's what the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the national Commercial Bank, calls its long-suffering employee, Jerome Kerviel.
It lost almost five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to compete with his teammates and he was certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's mentally weaker", his superiors said, sending the police after him.
But according to Kerviel's testimony, which was reported by French media such as Le Monde, he was the man who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros on his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he says in his statement.
Last summer, he managed to make half a billion euros on the American crisis.
He sensed an opportunity early this year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had trouble paying back their loans in the past, would be in trouble.
The impact on the economy was not to be expected.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
By the end of the year, its profit had climbed to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it", admits Kerviel, adding that he had absolutely nothing to keep to himself.
He admits all the time he was interrogated that he falsified the records so that he wouldn't be found.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his business.
Risk was the gain
Was he afraid he'd be found out?
I think not.
"I thought the simple fact that I had made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them".
Where did he get the will to take such risks?
He had to work his way up the ladder.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and in 2005, he became a freelance broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, he knew he'd never make as much as the others.
"Even in my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
For my education and also for my professional and personal development", Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the launch, the first big success came.
Allianz's stock has earned him half a billion euros in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger -- he wanted more.
As long as you're earning, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball", he told the police.
But the bosses knew about it, or suspected it.
"They were blind as long as I was making money".
But then the injury came earlier this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After a weekend in mid-January, he was gonna wipe it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only picked four days in the past year.
A broker who is not on leave is a broker who does not want anyone looking at his records", concluded Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Czech government ministers and the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can receive €14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will be channelled from the seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The largest amount of money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the funds the Czech Republic can receive.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be administered with an amount of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and firms to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should be able to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
In terms of the way it has been drawing money from EU funds, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful of the newly admitted countries.
Twenty-year sentence for former Nicaraguan president upheld
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 of committing $100 million in financial fraud.
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether they let Alemán serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court found that Alemán had been regularly transferring government funds to accounts in Panama held by foreign companies.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money ended up in a fund that Alemán set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget.
It's like this.
The state budget has been passed.
What makes this budget unique?
It is the first budget prepared by this government and passed by a coalition majority without opposition support.
This year's one passed with the support of the ČSSD last year, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives quietly passed this traditionally overlooked, but most influential, bill.
It's a bit of a paradox.
Every administration begins and ends with chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it's hidden behind the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
It's more appreciated by the media, and that's why it gets a lot more attention in the media.
The public is much more interested in politicians' guesses than in hard numbers.
The state budgets of previous social democratic governments suffered from three ills that the one for 2008 cannot solve all at once:
The first is the high share of legally mandated expenditures, which are not only pensions but also social benefits, approved by the silent "coalition" of the CPSU and the KSČM last year before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the former's failure.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of towns and municipalities.
But the biggest risk is not the government's budget deficit.
It's public and relatively controlled.
The time bomb is the deficit of city and municipal budgets.
To raise additional resources for investment, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, many mayors often issued bonds, often without thinking, which over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by selling off in bulk shares of power and other distribution networks they received from the state in privatisation.
Now they don't have that source.
If we stick to the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, like the rest of the world, which the SSC is constantly bragging about.
It was a unique opportunity for her government to put public finances in order.
Instead, the government became more and more indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have fared much more sensibly than our republic.
It's a huge shame that falls mainly on past governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been unnecessarily built up into gigantic proportions in recent years.
Even if we can undo some of the senseless populist spending that was approved this year before the election, if we don't move the retirement age and the pension reform in the near future, then in fact any politics in this country will end and whoever governs will be nothing but a cabinet.
With a little surplus, you can say that the politicians in power become bureaucrats, mechanically distributing most of the tax money to pensions and welfare benefits.
This year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by mandatory expenditure.
The projected deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments had not made the best of the last ten years.
If we do not want to see the politicians in power become mere functionaries, then we must be patient and allow this not very strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and fees, to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.
The Tailor
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland, and Canada have decided to join forces to fight the crisis in financial markets.
This will bring over $100 billion to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks bid at the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction off $40 billion, and then it will give the European and Swiss central banks access to the other $24 billion.
This is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that national central banks have agreed to such a coordinated approach to preventing or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is to address the economy's biggest problem, the growing shortage of free capital that banks can lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm, in a note to clients.
"The coordinated actions of central banks have reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in unpaid loans, primarily in the United States.
Analysts are expecting another billion-dollar loss.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what might follow if they decide to go this way", said ABN Amro Chief Economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will lend to their customers.
That would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with possible repercussions on global economic growth.
The central banks did so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for borrowing money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, even though the US, Canadian and British central banks had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another interest rate cut", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not think that the move by the central banks will help to heal the crisis, because it does not solve the underlying problem, which is the collapse of the US housing market.
The environmental debate is unbelievable.
The developing countries are expected to be the most affected by global climate change.
President Vaclav Klaus has once again addressed the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been leveled at the closing of the UN's international climate change conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said that the environmentalists' debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of government and NGO representatives, unacceptable, but so is the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are substitutes for solving current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President, in presenting his book, emphasised that the subject matter was very important to him and that this was why he was so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appeared in a German translation because, as he said, "I often find myself only dealing with caricatures of my views".
So now, those interested can read his unbiased position.
Klaus remarked that although he was not a climatologist, he felt that he had enough background to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to follow and assess academic papers, has experience in statistics and is also a national economist.
He concluded that climate change is a constant and therefore normal phenomenon, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too large and severe and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as someone who has experienced totalitarianism, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to questions from those in attendance that he was not against "sensible environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism that ignores the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver failed to replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed their deadline to get their old licenses, which expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for a new one, so that the authorities can issue them a new one before the end of the year.
But the Ministry is not worried about hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers hitting the road after New Year's.
According to the authorities, the only people who haven't changed their I.D.s are the ones who don't want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities are reporting a sharp decline in interest in license exchanges, the city's offices are overwhelmed with requests, and interest in license exchanges has increased this week.
The Magistrate sees about 2,000 clients a day.
There's a line waiting for about a half hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their licenses.
It takes 20 days to get a new ID.
However, it is possible to request extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay 500 kroner.
Motorists who fail to complete the mandatory licence change by the end of the year and take to the road without a valid licence will be subject to a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
A cop can solve a crime by talking.
In case of an administrative offence, the fine will be increased to 2500 crowns.
Earlier reports suggested that a person who didn't go anywhere could be fined by the city.
He was even said to have paid 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a fine of no more than a thousand kroner.
According to the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karl Hanzelka, 10,000 fines are not a threat to anyone.
He sees a driver's license as a document that people can use to decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a valid ID card that every person has to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
All you have to do is take it or send it by registered post to the appropriate municipal office.
At the end of the year, all the licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will expire.
However, motorists are also required to exchange other types of driving licences in stages.
People with IDs from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the cards issued between 2001 and 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the detectives associated with Berdych
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňárik, who are accused of criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
The Supreme Court in Prague ruled in their favor, reducing the sentences of one by one year and of the other by two years.
The original sentence for detectives of the Prague Committee for Combating Organized Crime was 14 and 12 years.
There is no appeal against today's decision, only an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is awaiting a first-instance verdict.
However, he has been sentenced to a total of more than 16 years in other trials.
That's all he can get.
In January, the district court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, and the Supreme Court heard the appeal of 16 of them today.
Most of the defendants have denied the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, the police officers, in agreement with Berdych, provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang would give 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Koňarik.
The charges relate to gang activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, which often result in serious health damage, but also the abuse of power by public officials and the illegal arming of civilians.
During home searches, police found illegal handguns, steel-core bullets, laser-guided weapons, and machine guns.
The gang is accused of robbing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdyche area are still testifying in another trial, some cases never before before seen in court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půt and Maros Šulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
The bill for the exchange of children: 12 million
For the replacement of children in the maternity ward, the lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleb wants the Třebíč Hospital to pay 12 million crowns, plus court costs.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of $200,000 for each parent.
The lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál therefore disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very, very high", said Dostal after today's meeting.
"In order to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need an expert opinion, which the counterparty has requested.
We'll see if it has any tell-tale value.
But we remain convinced that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone", stressed Dostal.
He estimates that the amount should be between $100,000 and $200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jablonow wanted a million crowns for every month that she did not raise her biological daughter.
Velebovi served as a basis for negotiating a compensatory expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Praze-Motole.
The parents of the children, according to experts in the fields of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress in varying degrees and depths.
Men were better able to handle the stress, even though they were guilty of not preventing the birth of a newborn.
Women, on the other hand, have a harder time coping with the actuality of a trauma and what is happening right now, summed up the content of Veleb.
Veronica and Nicola were switched by the nurses at the Třebíč maternity hospital on December 9 last year.
Last week, the children were returned to their birth parents - Nikola to Chermakov to Prysyslavic and Veronika to Libor Broz and Jaroslav Troyanov to Jablonow.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, handed each of the families 100,000 crowns at the end of October to compensate for the expenses they incurred due to the error of the Třebíč hospital, which the region established.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured against liability by law.
In case of mistakes, they have to resort to the reserve fund, or they can ask the founder for help.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low compensation, with amounts in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The soup has lost the kingdom of Valais
Bolek Soup lost the dispute over the trademark of the Kingdom of Wales.
According to the judge of the Ostrava County Court, although the Wallachian king first used the designation, the project was built by a long-term working team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
Soup was not in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The controversy is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolka Solivka", Solivka's lawyer said after the trial.
He says that when you hear the word "Kingdom of Wales", you'll think of an actor and a comedian.
That's the same opinion of Harabis.
"We have nearly ten years of work behind us.
"Making money and making deals", he said.
He thinks money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and could benefit from it.
They want to parasitize our work", he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Welsh king first used the broth in his TV show.
In 1993, she was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohaty.
But it was not a matter of trying to build a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Walloon passports.
From the original recessionary action, trade and lucrative business activities emerged, to which Harabiš then continued the foundation of the company of the Kingdom of Valais.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to have his name and signature on passports and even offered their holders discounts on visits to his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš merely used the idea that Sourdough had published in the cartoon for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Sobička's project in the Kingdom of Valaš certainly helped", said the judge.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who were intensely dedicated to it.
The cooperation of the now-conflicted parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabish began to accumulate, culminating in the deposition of "King Bolesław I, elected for a time".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila Šulačka as the queen mother, at the behest of Harabiš.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
The light might be brought into the dispute by Harabi's impending overthrow of the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come from him.
He wouldn't give details or a date.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like riding the kings on the Slovak.
A king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Sour can also come in", added Harabiš.
The Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: prejudice is disappearing
To be honest, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
The handling was not very good, the quality of the line, the handling and the production could be described as well below average.
But there's a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market now, and it's much better.
And the SW van is a little further on, and I'm just gonna have to think about it.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the back seats, for example.
That's the end of the complaint, because the body of the station wagon means that even a six-foot-long one won't suffer in this direction.
♪ Fly through the world ♪
I'm going to go over the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty good design, with my only criticism being the poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invention here, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about the short seats or the backs.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly against the 206.
As for the space, there's a sense of increased body dimensions here.
The above-mentioned lack of space disappears in the van.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing on this car is its trunk.
I must say that it is very accessible (also thanks to the folding rear window) and that it is well-kept.
The soft spots are fitted with retention tires, which is the ideal compromise.
It's not a hindrance, it's stretchable, and it holds heavy objects.
But let's just talk about the volume.
The table shows a base configuration of 428 liters, which is more like an average value against the competition.
But not against the best-selling car in its class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Young Boleslav product, we find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a very noticeable 52 liters.
This value is critical for a foreign holiday or for loading a stroller.
But if I had to pick up the positives, I'd have to mention the completely flat floor after folding the second-row seat backs or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine with 88 kW.
And to be honest, this is what a 16 grand should look like when it's driving a family hatchback.
It's quiet, low-power, and it's dragging, first and foremost.
Compared to the pest season, which sometimes seems like it's got a rag stuffed into the exhaust, I can't be more thrilled.
The price tag says
The price of the car is not popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a car with a match is 14,000 CZK 329,900.
Our generator costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment tested will then add an extra $200,000 worth of equipment.
But we still had the head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic air-conditioning, electric rear window controls...
The car costs $1,500.
It's a lot, but count the extras at Fabia and you'll come up with a pretty similar number.
So we have to decide on a brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not working
The increase in Eastern European children in British schools has raised concerns among local residents about the future of local education.
Integration of Eastern Europeans is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even record instances where disputes between immigrants and Aboriginal children escalate into violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated by the case of northern Kent, where conflicts between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
The quarrels, bullying, and fighting among the students also affected the relationship between the parents.
The situation got so bad that in Chatham, police arrested a Slovak woman for beating a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
She's defending the boy's racial slurs.
Police had to intervene after the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls reportedly showered the men with racist remarks and threw stones at them.
"On our way home, a boy climbed up on the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he attacked us with apples and pears, then exposed his ass", the mother of the Slovak students told The Times.
Complaints are coming from both sides.
One local settler even described the conflict with the Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who came here for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools at the time.
Cuba the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you want from your vacation, it can be yours if you choose it right.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, as calm as a pond.
Palm and all inclusive with waitstaff offering pizza, ice cream and cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you'll find it in a full and even richer display.
But there's more than that on one island, and that island is Cuba, the biggest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
For the Spanish, Cuba was the stronghold of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and a transhipment point for the treasures the Spanish had stolen from America and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 1920s.
He was set up by one of the American mafia bosses, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially Prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba, drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were Mgr.
Winston Churchill, and Ava Gardner, and Frank Sinatra, and all of them.
Havana was a city of high-rise buildings, with wide boulevards lined with cars that were cult symbols of the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a mansion in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America have left their signatures.
What about today?
You can sign your autograph on the walls of Havana's Bodeguita.
The bar at the expensive Hotel Nacional will serve you a cocktail to your liking.
And those iconic cars from the '50s are still driving around Havana, because the once imported jiggles and fiddles have long since rotted in the salty, damp air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is in a state of considerable disrepair, nowhere nearby are there such magnificent colonial monuments as there.
Other places are turning into beauty, too, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings in so much needed money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, and others.
Cuba offers another delight, one of a kind in the world, that is especially appreciated by the travelers.
A third of the vast plantations were transported to the sugar mills by narrow rails of steam and locomotive trains.
Their fleet has not been updated for many decades, and so they have machines in operation that are found only in museums.
Go where?
The most famous of these places are not missed by most visitors to Cuba.
And Varadero, or Havana, there's no need to say much.
Perhaps it is only to remind you that the above-mentioned home of Hemingway is a museum, and if you like the writer, you should not miss a visit.
The Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque parts of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
The limestone underneath is lush with vegetation.
Moguls, limestone homols, and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor, and the fertile soil has taken hold in their caverns, making even the windswept cliffs a dense cover.
The valley is the place where perhaps the finest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see it in its final form by visiting one of Havana's cigar factories.
Some might find it interesting that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there.
The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago
An ancient city, founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and fortune came from the slave trade and sugar.
Wealth has been transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has remained almost unchanged for four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that as recently as the 1950's, there were no roads connecting it to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built, so there was no noise, so everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, it is worth looking at nearby attractions, such as Playa Ancón or the Valley of Sugar Beet.
In the evening, you can visit the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music is silenced in the morning.
Other, including cane sugar
A small town in the easternmost part of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Indeed, the very road itself influences such a view.
The two roads that lead from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that has been barely touched by human activity.
The eastern highlands of Cuba have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of their unspoiled nature.
They make the best chocolate, they have a Columbus cross in the church (actually made about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage), and from the hill where the former castle and the El Castillo hotel now stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs, and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of Cuba's patron saint, Caridad del Cobre, Santería, the African religions that are practiced by descendants of former slaves, all of these could be described in many pages.
But, as they say, it's better to see than to know.
The Allies in Afghanistan are passive, say the Americans.
The United States believes that the shortage of troops and equipment is affecting the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, as representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country are meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, the eight participating states are now also discussing further plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called for greater NATO action, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and increasing development aid.
"The developments in Afghanistan are tangible, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The next step is to allow the people to take the next steps in economic development and security", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent of the time.
Afghan insurgent activity is at its highest level in five years, according to U.S. military data.
Violent incidents increased by 27 percent from last year, in the southern province of Helmand by as much as 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
But according to the United States, the Allies had reached the limit in organization and equipment.
Specifically, they're requesting more helicopters, troops and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think hard about concrete goals for the next period and ways to achieve them", Gates said.
The same was said today by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop.
"I'm not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy among the participating countries in recent months about whether all the allies are maximising their efforts in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the demands of combat are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers "lazy".
"Afghan idlers exposed: Germans playing while our boys fight", Sun wrote in the footage, accompanied by footage of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went on the counter-attack, printing a picture of British troops at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will soar to a trillion dollars in 2009
Each Czech citizen has a national debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Total debt increased to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government was planning to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, in early December, the Ministry reduced the budget to 152.8 billion crowns due to the improved management of the state budget.
The public debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it's increased by $2.4 billion.
However, since June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Treasury Department today confirmed its government debt figures from early October.
Each Czech is owed over 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state was over $111 billion in debt.
"For the time being, it seems that with a lower deficit for next year, we could not cross the billion kroner mark until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and 1 trillion korunas", Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
The same view is shared by Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance: "We could reach the one billion mark by the end of 2009.
Exactly when will depend on the next budget, which we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don't expect this change", he said.
Debts are rising
The public debt is the debt of the central government and is mainly created by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The public debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The national debt has increased by 38.5 billion crowns so far this year to 719,4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has risen by 1.7 billion crowns so far this year to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable government debt stood at SEK 803,3 billion at the end of September and decreased by SEK 13,7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt has increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose 13 percent year-over-year in the first through third quarters, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly by bonds, where there is a 20 percent increase.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows what it will be dealing with when there is a pension reform", commented data Pikora.
Better than expected
The strategy for financing and managing the public debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159,2 billion this year.
However, in early December, the Ministry reduced the budget to 152.8 billion crowns due to the improved management of the state budget.
The amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
Furthermore, the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are CZK 13,3 billion, a pension provision of CZK 10 billion, financing of CZK 43 billion of government bonds and installments of CZK 1,8 billion of loans from the European Investment Bank.
A woman is due in court today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear after her.
A British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison and deported by a Khartoum court late Thursday, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of letting six- to seven-year-old pupils name a teddy bear Muhammad, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was subjected to the punishment of the lash.
The 54-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several students filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins back in September, when the teacher in question asks her six- or seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classroom teddy bear.
"Eight names are coming out of the mouths of the children, including Hasan, Abdullah, and Mohammed", says school principal Robert Boulos.
After a vote in the class, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose the most popular name, Mohammed.
Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, of course, but it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear and the caption: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself bore no name tag, but the problem is the very depiction of the prophet, which is considered an insult to Islam.
One of her Muslim colleagues, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I only regret that she asked children to vote for a name", he said, adding that it was just "an innocent mistake".
This is the view shared by many of her students, who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and add that she "never talks about religion in class".
Remember, the first name Mohammed is also the second most common given name in the UK, spelled in 14 different ways in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give them to a toy?
Of course, it is a matter of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
Failure in the end.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians concluded their sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, failing to overcome differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the two sides have not been able to reach an agreement on the status", European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His US counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to uphold their commitments to peace and be ready for dialogue after the negotiations are over.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a challenging period", he added, adding that "it is evident that the situation is tense".
The negotiations will end on December 10th.
The troika of negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their final trip to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the population is Albanian-speaking, could be brighter by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are due to present their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, are the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN gave the Troika the mandate to resume negotiations in August this year.
The Americans and the Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favor of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community rule, the West sees Kosovo's independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade is insisting on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement", announced the president of the Kosovo self-government Fatmir Sejdiu in the Baden hotel, where the "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and future premier of the province, expressed his condolences.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
The Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still a possibility and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly worried about a "domino effect" in the region, which is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia", he said, "that does not mean that compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions were the sole responsibility of the Security Council, where its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say"
"The only solution acceptable to Serbia is the one that comes from the Security Council", declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"The proceedings lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the floor of the Security Council".
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be the Kosovo parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would be "after agreement" with the West.
Bush got the Israelis and the Palestinians to make a deal.
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called by his own initiative, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start talks immediately with the aim of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything in his power to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations both sides have under the "road map" to peace they agreed in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority aim to "concluded a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the core issues".
The declaration covers three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in the 1948 conflict to the territory of the modern state of Israel.
Abbas took after the US president, emphasizing that the follow-up was "comprehensive and thorough" and touched on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert then took the podium, expressing the view that the follow-up negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "efforts should be made to conclude them during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for the realization of his "two-state vision", of Palestinians and Israelis existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it accepted Bush's commitment to this end before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal accepted by all Arab countries, offering Israel peace in exchange for the abandonment of all Arab territories captured in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saud said in an interview with an Arabic-language newspaper backed by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such minor news from the Black Chronicle, the official version does not match what is said among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the investigation by the Inspection Générale de la Police Nationale (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in the commune of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in collision mode, but was on patrol and was traveling at 40 to 50 km/h, with no side lights on", explains a police source.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "not registered and therefore not authorized to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without helmets, was traveling "at very high speed".
"The motorcycle crashed into a police car from the left after failing to make a right-hand turn", one officer said.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew was negative.
The car's condition (puncture of the front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) is indicative of the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise), Marie-Thérèse de Givry, reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "acts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", which is also the responsibility of the Department of Public Safety of Val-d'Oise.
During a press conference this afternoon, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation rules out, at this stage, the police officers' responsibility for the accident.
Three accident witnesses who were questioned Sunday night confirmed "the police's version that the mini-motorcycle approached them from the left fairly quickly", according to the office.
A scuffle, no doubt caused by the clipping of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained pinned until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
Both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened, right after?
There was a rumour going around yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had to leave the scene of the crime without giving first aid to the two young men.
The IGPN should also, with due care, rule out 'any serious misconduct' on this point.
"This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, requiring more investigation and with which you have to be very careful", said a police source.
The newspaper "Libération" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows leads directly to the accident.
"Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, and I ran downstairs to try to resuscitate them", the witness relates.
There was nothing we could do".
Then he saw "a limp, terrified policeman.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the youths, and the fourth was talking on the telephone".
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and the certainty of the crowd that the situation of the young men was hopeless, the officers were driven away by a colleague's car, who had meanwhile arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police had left".
They also performed a heart massage, but to no avail.
"Let no one say that the police authorities did not rush to the aid of the young men.
These young men were given first aid.
Fire department came right away.
Everything was done to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions in Pakistan are rising
Pakistani police on Monday crushed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the emergency measures were wounded by tear gas grenades, which witnesses said were used by law enforcement.
The latter responded with stone-throwing, injuring several policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been subpoenaed.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
A few of them should have been summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
The access roads to the Supreme Court were cordoned off Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "urged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who swore before Musharraf".
"Musharafa's promise is not valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly targeted by the emergency measures announced Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election held on 6 October.
The President of the court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court's rulings", declared an official in The News.
Parviz Musharraf's promise to relinquish command of the military and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the imposition of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also dismissed ongoing speculation in the country that the Deputy Chief of Army Staff should have ordered President Musharraf's house arrest.
More than one third of pregnancies are still unintended
This includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as those that were unplanned or unexpected.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unintended, according to a study conducted by the French National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the so-called Neuwirth Law, which legalized contraception in France.
This includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as those that were unplanned or unexpected.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still have a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
The legalization of contraception has, after all, made it possible to improve "fertility control", the Institute claims, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
One in five couples even have their births scheduled for the month of the year, and if possible, in spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for a baby to be born.
A Remarkable Repair to the Space Station
It took more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair to a torn solar panel, necessary for the station's continued scientific activities.
It was a risky spacewalk that set records for the length of time it took to reach the habitable modules, the speed at which it was scheduled, and the amount of "kitty" that the astronauts spent on repairs.
The trouble began on Tuesday as astronauts from the space shuttle Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical device designed to house a European and Japanese science lab (see box).
This module is a kind of landing dock for the lab modules.
But they need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate the 17 and a half tonne solar module already on the ISS to anchor at its final destination.
After moving it, the crew began laying out the module's 700-foot solar array.
And in it, one of the panels, folding like a pulling harmonica, as a result of the pinching of the cable, was damaged in an area of almost one meter.
Deposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to perform a control climb on the Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to focus on the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, attached to the station's arm, and perform the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers in the United States.
Tall, stout, very nimble, with a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original occupation doctor was assigned to "operate" on a "wounded" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut the faulty wire and attached a "floor" to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who stayed near the balancing chamber, and also from inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew chief.
The tool he used, a miniature hockey stick covered with insulation to prevent an electric shock to the solar panels producing several hundred volts, was invented and "cut-and-paste" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the surgery, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely disassembled, then inventoried his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a midday rest before the day when the seven astronauts return to the shuttle Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
EADS shares are falling
EADS shares are falling sharply on the Paris stock exchange after the aerospace and defence company announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the A400M delay.
EADS has lost 4% and is now trading on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The Financing Group was forced to reconsider its forecasted 2007 production results due to delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the maiden flight.
The price for alleviating delays in the delivery of the military cargo plane, announced in October, was put at "between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new profit before interest and taxes (EBIT) forecast on Thursday when it presents its quarterly results.
The group also disclosed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a delay of six months.
It should be recalled that EADS's production results in 2006 fell by 86%, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the A380 giant.
The group originally envisaged delivering the first A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The decision for the status quo
Sunday's election will be conducted without any tense expectations: Russians will overwhelmingly vote for President Putin's United Russia party.
Confirming, after the end of a very little free election campaign, their desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the House of Representatives, Russian President Vladimir Putin is giving a televised message to voters on public television stations, but the content of the message is kept secret.
He's doing so as the leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that looks set to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president let none of it show, and settled for another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite campaign theme.
"We know the value of true democracy and we want an honest, as transparent and open as possible election, an election without the slightest blemish of beauty", he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not even close.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election, not even under Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for unlawful demonstration, has been given a restraining order, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians are left with a homo sovietica mentality"
In the background of these parliamentary elections, free of tense expectations, two far more open questions are emerging:
- "Who will be Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Gazette published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive term.
But no successor has emerged.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
He's going to be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win in a landslide in the parliamentary elections, as well as the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Russians have retained the mentality of the homo sovietica, they do not feel that they are masters of their fate", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University notes a more distant connection: civil society in this country, Christianized five centuries after Europe, has been late; that famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has built on a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism has not been accompanied by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity", believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Russians today are "voluntarily renouncing personal responsibility", as they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"What to think about?"
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
Even the bureaucratic elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run local United Russia candidates.
The new freedoms that have been taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion is favoring stability.
Also, in the name of stability, Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion by Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old professor: "What is there to think about?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Memory used
After more than 60 years in a secret regime, the Nazi archives in Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are opening to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored in a 27 km long area in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have so far been accessible only for 'humanitarian' purposes, that is, individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
In May, 11 nations - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed to open the archives to scientists and historians.
As the ratification process of this agreement by all states is complete, the opening became effective yesterday.
The following information is provided for each Member State:
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to examine "especially the transfers of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, opposed the opening of these documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of some of the information.
What are the alleged homosexuality or mental disabilities of some of the deportation victims?
The concentration camp or arrest warrant records compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced to work civilian citizens, to bring them evidence of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, over 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some in the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents", said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin's Technische Universität, in 2006.
EU and India aim to conclude free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already worth nearly EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's number one trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expecting to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath have announced.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations on free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's number one trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The FTA will be a huge boost to both economies" and "India will gain better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", argued Peter Mandelson.
The EU and India will meet on Friday for the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso.
(AFP) The report also states that the
The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction.
The Bank of England on Thursday signaled its intention to allay current fears of a renewed deterioration in credit market conditions by announcing a £10 billion bid in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an unusually long bid.
'In an effort to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks more certainty in how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,' the press release said.
The bank specifies that £10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the base rate.
It appears to be the first time the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally, they last a week.
The Bank of England also stated that the Bank of England would not be able to provide loans to the public without the consent of the public.
The interbank daily rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates that have discouraged banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to some speculation, fuelled by the development of the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many preferred to opt for the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
The UMP (Union for a Popular Movement) and the NC (New Centre) refuse to consider the Socialists' (PS) proposals on the purchasing power of the
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss the individual paragraphs of the Socialist bill on affordability on Thursday, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
The bill was put on the agenda during the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by a group of MPs) and contained a dozen measures adopted by the PS presidency on Tuesday, including an increase in employment premiums by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPPs, transport checks and the regulation of rent.
Since the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the sitting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his club would re-submit the proposals in their entirety as amendments to the draft budget bill, which will be debated by the House next week.
A new festival is born
In the wake of much speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia was launching a new festival, this promoter/producer announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Republic Festival of British producer Melvin Benn.
"It's an honor for our company to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without any exaggeration", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled for August 8th to 10th at a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most respected festival directors.
In 1989 he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been in charge of production, licensing and organisational duties at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he has ever experienced and says his company and Melvina Benna are working in tandem to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as the market, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to establish the festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We worked with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current leadership of the city, we have become entangled in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Luckily, we've had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we're about to launch a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia".
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005 after having distinguished themselves on the festival scene by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn takes place in the countryside, whereas our festivals are more like green spaces in the cities", says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to bring the two together in a way that creates both a European-style rural festival and an American-style urban one".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The town of Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but claims "that they are profitable enough to allow investing in such an event and to welcome a festival that will, hopefully, have a long life".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which holds 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent out to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed yet as the program is just being printed.
"Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be diverse, to appeal to a wide range of audiences", says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at last year's Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal facing the Terminators
It's not easy to bring Hollywood studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself stands against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's duties.
But his mandate is "politically challenging" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has condemned "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall under the "Governor's" claws?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer what they think is the best", he said.
Hunting for festivals
For the moment, however, Denise Turcottea's priority is to promote the local film.
The Oscar hunt has already begun.
All the West Coast festivals, whether they're Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about introducing Quebec films, raising awareness and ensuring that directors are interviewed.
The Dark Ages had some good press a few weeks ago at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival.
It's being shown at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on sale in Santa Monica and will be shown in November at the 30th annual Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year on the stock exchange?
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the fiscal year, investors are already on their hands, expecting the traditional end-of-the-year marathon to happen.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banka Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December is a positive month for the stock market".
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, especially since, in the current context, the markets are subject to some uncertainty, at least in the short term.'
These experts do not expect the stock market to move in the last weeks of the year, and state that 'the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, in particular fixed income influenced by the effect of turnover to quality securities, both in long and short sections'.
They therefore believe that the stock market will be more calm, rather than volatile, "mainly because the impact of a likely Fed rate cut is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, sales manager for BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to make bold statements about a marathon.
"There is little to be excited about", the expert assures us.
The Ibex lost almost 4% from the highs recorded on 8 November, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet, not all experts are so negative.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year just below 16,000 points due to the re-grouping of portfolios and traditional pension insurance deposits that occurs every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the long weekend of the Constitution Day celebration.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "so we could see the reflection of the index, triggered by news from the US about the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts are unanimous in their choice of securities that will ensure that Ibex reaches new highs.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year's line is on strong titles".
This expert would include both big banks and some construction firms in his portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
The construction companies will also be able to make a fortune from this marathon, if it happens.
"ACS has been recovering its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit", explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that the technology will also do very well, even if it is not very represented in this field in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, December has only been a leap month on two occasions.
The real marathon at the end of the year was in 2003, the year the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the tech bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive year of profit (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and whether it will be able to run its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the Bank Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
Two hundred in total, located in the most commercially important parts of Spain.
These branches, operated under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
As well as for the other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a leap and to bet on the continuous opening time of its branches until 20.30 and to open on Saturdays from 10 to 20.30.
Another group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, he's going to make a deal with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of his branches on Saturdays in exchange for an extension of the opening hours for one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for whether or not other entities join this initiative to promote business opening hours.
That's exactly the goal of the project that Popular Bank has set itself.
To attract individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized businesses, tradesmen and shops from selected streets where the opening of branches takes place.
The Bank intends to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within 18 months, as this is not a new branch opening but only an adaptation of the existing ones.
The Bank therefore modernises the branches it already has in the business areas by adapting them to the customer profile in the individual streets.
This extended opening hours is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colours.
The commercial director of the bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but rather a larger recruitment of staff, as the number of employees in the branch will increase from six to eight or nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for SMEs and will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Banco Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
The branches in Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets were chosen, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a lucky choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2 500 branches.
And another 60 specialized for immigrants, which are operated under the brand Mundocredit, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
The PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, whereby a number of BBVA branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients,' says Rivera.
They just got a deal with the phone company to sell cell phones through outside personnel.
Telecinco has doubled the value of its rival Anteny 3 for the first time on the stock exchange.
We did it.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, the CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the close of business yesterday, stating that the television he runs has doubled the value of its rival, Antenna 3.
Only one thing has spoiled his joy: 'What I regret is that it was not because we had grown more, but because we had fallen less,' he said.
He stressed that because of the weak market, "we've fallen less".
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
This profit pushed their loss for the year to 15.66%.
The market value of this company, controlled by Mediaset (52% of the capital) with Vocenta's participation (another 13%) is therefore, according to Bloomberg, EUR 4 488,88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and 40.5% since January, is worth half of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies valued amounts to 3,571 billion for Sogecable, 2 518,53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion for Vocento.
According to Vasil, the comparison with Antenna 3 is interesting because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price, and how we evaluate it in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it is expecting to surpass a billion gross advertising revenue this year to become the first television channel, as confirmed by Giuseppe Tringali, the executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that provides the group's advertising.
If the forecast had been realised, the channel would have seen its advertising revenue increase by 3.6% this year, compared with 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Antenna 3's net turnover increased by 1,6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734,4 million), while its net income increased by 0,7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative performance of Telecinco on the stock market is the increased pay-out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is too early to decide, this coefficient could change following the acquisition of 33% of Endemol by its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always given much more.
This year, I hope we'll be able to satisfy our shareholders, who have already increased Endemol's value by 33%.
Analysts say the market is showing some fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
This is because the projected revenue growth from 0,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009 has stopped.
The same company reduced the estimated profit of Antenna 3 by 4,5% in 2008 and by 7,5% in 2009.

Congress has approved the transposition of MiFID effective November 1
In conjunction with the parliamentary proceedings that ended today with the congressional vote on the novelties incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has put in place a public hearing on the regulations that develop the new law, with the goal that both will come into effect before the end of the year.
The representatives of the parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the efficient functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which amends the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory bodies of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial advisory services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFI) which will join securities firms, securities brokerage firms and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments is expanding by adding multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law also requires firms providing investment services to disseminate information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of coping with risk, and requires a report of all transactions carried out to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
During the Congressional Commerce Committee hearings, several amendments were included, the most prominent of which was to consider securitised debt instruments as a 'complex' financial instrument due to the high investor risk demonstrated by the US subprime experience.
Moreover, the transposition of the Directive was used to lay down the functions which a Bachelor's degree in economics and business administration may fulfil, 30 years after the Royal Decree of 1977 laying down the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate also considered the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require authorisation from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms simultaneously.
The harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4,1% in November
This indicator, which is subsequently used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on the price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data in a timeframe and quality comparable to those obtained in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE) pointed out that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure, which will be available on 14 December this year.
'ISC will continue to maintain a relatively high level'
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% was a "temporary figure", but predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the congressional columns that "even if it is not a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential against monetary union has remained "more or less" the same for the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not anticipate such a large increase.
"We were expecting a value of around 4 percent", the Minister of Economy said of the figures presented today.
Virgin plans to make $42 billion in three years with Northern Rock.
Since the Northern Rock bank went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (EUR 16,8 billion).
At the time, the bank was managing record deposits worth over £25 billion, which gradually fell over two and a half months due to customer distrust, despite the government offering a 100% guarantee on the money and extending it until the crisis ended.
Virgin, which will replace the entity's name with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenues deposited in UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach its £30 billion target.
Richard Branson's group, known in the United Kingdom for its flashy advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week marked the offer of the Virgin Consortium, which includes three other companies, as the one they'd prefer to save from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corrupt practices in construction
The Civil Guard arrested the current Mayor of the city of Murcia, Totán (People's Party) in the early hours of today for his alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices that were revealed this week.
Also arrested were one of the town's secretaries and the local police chief.
José Martínez Andreo replaced in May this year Juan Morales, the current deputy of the Popular Movement and until then mayor of the village, who according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER television, could be the 'head' of the whole enterprise.
Police are continuing to monitor the city hall and the building committee, and no further arrests are expected in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the corrupt practices in the construction industry that were uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to investigative sources, Morales is also being investigated for allegedly collecting commissions for signing a construction contract with a Galician construction company, which was overqualified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being held.
Bono accepted the offer to head the Toledano PSOE candidates and, if they win, to chair the Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist General Secretary José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero to stand at the head of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) candidacy list in Toledo in the next general election and, if the Socialists win the general election, to become President of the Congress.
This was announced by the PSOE Secretary for Organization, José Blanco, and by Bono himself, at a press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place at noon today in the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that the politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for president of the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who announced on November 15 that he would not run in the next general election and would leave his active political career to focus on fighting climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister had been constantly urging him to return to the top policy he abandoned two years ago.
He added that just as citizens know who will be the deputy minister of economy if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will preside over the Congress.
If Bono wins the office, he hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect, not abuse or shouting" and achieve "a more and more like-minded citizenry".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak in peace and quiet is the Congress, where the president of the Senate was interrupted on one occasion 26 times".
He also praised current president Manuel Marin and "his good work" and did not want to put himself in his place for now, lest he stoop to what his opponents might consider "magnanimity".
The climate
With the climate change movement facing relentless persecution from those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must show solid unity.
And to have a leader of a movement that is a prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This motion requires him to explain why the actions or inaction of his government have contributed significantly to Spain's leading position in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spanish people as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be harmed, what habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, will have to be accepted, and what the economic consequences will be.
In other words, who's sacrificing and who's paying to save the planet.
But we did not expect, nor will we ever expect, such an explanation.
Because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Climate change measures, real measures, are not popular.
Dear, inconvenient and threatening business and personal accounts.
Even a penny of the petrol price proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) seemed risky enough for Zapatero from the electoral point of view to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet by doing nothing, by pure propaganda, by slogans that have no real meaning.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, minutes and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not accuse, does not demand anything, but is the ornament of meetings and inspires tenderness.
If he's just a virtual contracting party and doesn't want us to ride bikes and chill with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the Totana Police Department have been arrested on suspicion of corruption in the construction industry.
According to investigating sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the city of Murcia, Totano, the "people's man" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the town clerk and a businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and taken to the town hall, where he is now with a number of police officers who also turned themselves in to the Building Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Plots and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation to convert more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land into land suitable for construction so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last election period, could build 4,000 homes.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are being charged in a summary trial at the first instance court of Totana.
The first six arrested were brought to trial today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and current member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
The former wife, owner of a real estate office registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were also charged.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as was Pablo José M. G., director of the firm Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which the bribes were passed.
The investigation is being carried out by the Civil Guard Operational Central Unit's Building Crime Group, whose members, in addition to making arrests, have also carried out eleven searches, mostly in firms related to those arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid Province) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, a well-known local poultry-products company owner who could serve as a go-between.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totana, which would have involved the construction of more than 5 000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a 'spa'.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was requalified, and its project was to double the settlement of the municipality, which has a population of 25 000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are involved in the promotion of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages the parking in Coruña Street, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is engaged in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

If you don't mind, we'll put the Book of the Month aside and maybe we can come up with some other awards and competitions in the meantime.
I've already got something in my head.
Guys, life is about change.
Of course you can come up with ideas.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this commentary from yesterday's edition of the leading Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (which, by the way, is at the beginning of the PISA report on the world's education level), referring to what the newspaper printed on November 18, the same day that Blackburn's book was also criticized:
"The content of the philosophy course has entered public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the Jokela school.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the school councillor responsible for the philosophy course, demanded in the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic philosophy course in high schools".

One colleague reports on the introduction of the offence of downloading from the Internet into the penal code:
A. Downloading a single song would be a felony punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal a record in a shop for less than EUR 400, this is considered a mere offence (Section 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 in a shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for withdrawal (§234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for tow (§ 244.1)
D. It's less serious to get into a fight than a compact exchange.
To participate in a riot is punishable by three months to one year (§ 154 of the penal code) and for the exchange of compacts the penalty would be six months to two years
The Commission has not yet received any information from the Commission.
E. Sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Penal Code than downloading a movie on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punishable by a penalty equal to that for the supply of pornographic material to minors (§186).
So unless my colleague is mistaken, someone's hand is off, and off the deep end.

My attending doctor pushes me one of his articles about strange research called "Money Causes Brain Activation, Especially When Others Get Less".
In other words, the feelings that the monthly salary evokes in employees depend on how much their colleagues earn.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the study's author and head of the neurocognitive imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, "the greatest activation occurred when the subject responded correctly and his colleague responded incorrectly".
The researchers observed that if they both passed, they got the same pay, the activation was mild, but if one got twice as much, the activation was higher.
I'm not sure that conclusion required so much science.
The applicant from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the State Prosecutor's Office in the Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former general Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the title of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary film "Karlin List" (2006, not shown in Spain) was taken, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in pursuing fugitive criminals and pressuring the relevant states to shut down the network from Belgrade to New York at the pace of a detective thriller.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, is a considerable expense, which depends on various factors such as age, status, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurer will receive an agreed sum of insurance in exchange for taking responsibility for the payment of the damage in the event of an insured event.
The insurable is the price of the insurance, which is determined by various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of holding a driving licence, type of vehicle insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies base their prices on statistics, so the greater the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both men and women over 25 years of age have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
Similarly, insurance companies have concluded that married people have fewer crashes than single drivers.
The way a vehicle is used will affect the frequency of its use and thus the likelihood of it being involved in an accident.
The more you drive, the more likely it is.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of a policy.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation carefully in order to choose the insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will show the most important variables for choosing a type of insurance that not only satisfies the type of policyholder but also provides a reasonable price.
People under 25 face various disadvantages, such as little driving experience and a short driving record, when they want to buy insurance at an affordable price.
Although all-risk insurance is ideal for good coverage, there are cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose to take out premium-rate all-risk insurance to get all-risk coverage at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would presuppose the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"The part of the payment of the insurance event that the client will provide will be set in advance when determining the price of the insurance premium, which will be higher the lower the co-participation would be", explains Luis Noguera, CEO of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is to extend the insurance coverage to other road users, so that the client is insured against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire, and loss of the vehicle.
Recommended
If you are under 25, try to be as careful as possible to avoid accidents, as this will affect your bonus and reduce future premiums.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that an insurance company has.
On the other hand, the minus is an increase in the basic rate.
"Bonus and loss will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it can afford to raise the bonus", explains Noguera.
After 25 years, drivers have an easier time getting insurance, because their client risk index is lowered by experience.
For this reason, it is highly recommended to take out insurance against all risks and rebates.
"Young people usually cannot use their experience when an accident happens, even when driving", says the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the "fear of the novice" has been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his financial situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the lowest risk-indicator clientele and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with a premium discount (which could be EUR 300) or with a high premium, the insurance extended to other road users, starting from the third year of the vehicle purchase.
"Their driving is quieter and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount", notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to take out a full risk insurance with a reduced premium (EUR 150) or an insurance extended to other road users if a high premium is achieved.
It must be said that automobile insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident but also because it is a considerable expense, which is a good reason to make a careful study of the insurance options that would best suit your personal situation.
Celtic are trying to get a point to AC Milan, which means the last eight
AC Milan and Celtic will battle it out this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an attempt to collect the point they are missing to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as it would mean first place for Italy and the Scottish would be decided by the result.
The Italians have 10 points and have already secured promotion in the fifth leg of a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but need one more to ensure they don't get ahead of Schachtor with six points, who will play Benfica with four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan have to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will be entering the semi-finals for the first time at 13, in an attempt to advance to the final, which will be played on the 16th.
So this group will be drawn before the others and a draw at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems the most likely, even if both teams will try to fight for the win, because the Italians will not want to play on home soil and Celtic know that a win would put them in first place and secure a better place in the last eight.
Gordon Strachan's men could even lose if Shakhtar do not win, but they cannot count on it, because with the same number of points, the Ukrainians will advance, who lost in Glasgow last week (2: 1), but won in the first direct match (2: 0).
AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening for the Scots, who believe they will reach the semi-finals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League, just as they beat them in the same match in the last competition with a goal by Kaká in extra time (1:0) after 0:0 in the regular playing time.
The hope of the "rossoneri" winning will be for Schachtor, for whom victory is only worthwhile if Celtic loses, both for the eighth round and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although last and without the possibility of continuing in Europe's top competition, could reach third place with one victory, so they would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver was attended by 20,000 people
The Spice Girls embarked on their first tour since their disbandment in 2000 in front of 20,000 fans in Vancouver, Canada.
Shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place in Vancouver, "Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) declared that the reunion of their band was "great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which included a video telling the story of the band that caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The comeback and world tour coincides with the release of a new album, which is being released in Spain by EMI, and which brings a selection of their major hits, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage, adorned with bracelets given to them by "Posh Spice's" husband, British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the crowd that flooded GM Place, despite a nervous Victoria telling him not to do so a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that he "hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the show".
"Sporty Spice", whose 1998 departure from the group "due to differences between us" caused the five-piece band to disband two years later, also expressed her nervousness in a press conference two hours before the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I did", Chisholm said of the reunion of the band, which she herself disbanded nine years ago.
The band also noted that in time "things have settled down and we all love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So to start, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special.
When they arrived at the airport, they were met by an army nurse.
Five has seven children.
After the Vancouver show, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He's going to be in Madrid on December 23rd.
Concerns over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
The ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas prices increases the risk that Russian supplies of gas to Western Europe may be affected.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it gets from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in the negotiations", Ukraine's Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
'The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of the transit fees (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.'
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which led to a sharp increase in prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's gas supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large part of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
The NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Comptroller said that the NHS chamber in Scotland needs to improve criminal record checks on non-European staff.
The recommendation from the head of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have a clear picture of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were fine on a sample of five health departments.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in recruiting staff from outside the European Economic Area immediately after the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone crashed a jeep into the main terminal building door.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court on video surveillance charged with being involved in attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK before they are hired.
Although Disclosure Scotland is used by the Scottish Health Commission for criminal record checks, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Board says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly", the report stated.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS was in much the same way as its own pre-employment screening policy, but added: 'Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information on the numbers of overseas staff is available.'
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "highly unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS staff who could commit an act of terrorism in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what additional value the recalls will bring", he said.
The Scottish Health Authority has announced that it currently has 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Control Authority warned that these figures may be higher also because the commissions had problems identifying staff with residence permits.
The survey also found that the established control procedures at NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely followed.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the policy and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign NHS workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport".
She also added that the Scottish Government, in consultation with the Health Committees, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practice is reflected in the updated pre-employment screening guidelines for all staff - including foreigners - that it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division took over the movie awards
Control, the biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, picked up five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Film.
Also up for awards were star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he played Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and, in a supporting role, Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench has been named best actress for the thriller Scandal Notes.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety award for bringing a British film to the world stage.
The awards were ceremonially presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control chronicles Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But it won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and for best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film - Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a Russian mafia boss's driver in David Cronenberg's London thriller Eastern Promises.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the next Indiana Jones: The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the Camelot and Harry Potter films, Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me", he added.
"I have been fortunate enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored".
The independent film awards, known as Bify, are given out by a jury that includes filmmakers, actors, and festival organizers.
Bif's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom, who are also known as the "Bif".
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 people for terrorism conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells that were preparing to directly attack oil facilities as well as clergy and security forces.
State television in the world's largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have been waging a campaign against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
A TV report said a cell of eight militants, led by a foreigner, was planning an attack on an oil rig in the province of Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid response unit to defend facilities from a botched al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery at Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry's internal statement: The 18 arrested were part of a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who slipped into the country.
She also said that militants were planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
The 22 detainees were to prepare the assassinations of clergy and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied forces and the US-backed Shiite government, which conservative Sunni Saudis see as heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - encouraged by calls by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings, and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the last... five months", an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested for promoting "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that encourages violence against Muslims deemed to be infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into Earth's future
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from an orbiting European station shows the planet is even more like Earth's mischievous twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's nearest planetary neighbor.
The two worlds are about the same size and orbit similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the runaway greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation and a slower rotation sent the Venusians down a very different evolutionary path.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a fresh look at how Earth might evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the University of Oxford's Physics Department and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar in other ways.
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago".
Police have seized "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and the material is being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the material could be sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Always wide open
Mitt Romney said it's not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Even so, the Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28th, were as comical as the snowman asking the Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions and the answers this time around reflect a lot about the state of the Republican Party heading into next year's election.
It's unclear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This issue is one of the strongest Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the dial when they heard something encouraging: the announcer recorded a surge of approval as candidates talked about a hardline approach to borders.
The hardest and longest exchange of views was between Rudy Giuliani, the leading candidate nationwide, and Mr. Romney, who had pushed ahead in the crucial early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
The two were especially at odds when the questioners asked whether either candidate would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
The minor candidates, like Duncan Hunter, the California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, the Colorado congressman, were able to put their foot down on the ground on this issue.
Neither of them have a chance of being nominated, but both of them are staying in the game, perhaps because they started the immigration alarm earlier and harder than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have pretty much the same view: more border controls, no tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns about the world around us, helps Republicans forget or minimize the difference between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun ownership in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani has even suggested that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now, against all odds, ranked number one in a recent Iowa poll because of his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Pressed to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, thus earning himself ridicule.
The fight remains extraordinarily open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa is matched by recent successes in fundraising and Ron Paul's loud cheering at Wednesday's debate.
These two have bounced back from the bottom, as both wings of the party still can't agree on the more familiar and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very quickly and convincingly with a winning message about American greatness on his lips, blinking on both sides of the party.
This time, the party is divided, and the outcome is far from clear.
The pain of Labour
Gordon Brown has found a trap to fall into again; his way out remains the same.
Although it is a customary practice in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills at a Paris hotel mysteriously paid, no out-of-wedlock fingers being plucked.
But the beleaguered Gordon Brown could have done without the discovery that some wealthy businessman had been concealing £650,000 ($1.3 million) in contributions to the ruling Labour Party under the names of other people for four years, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope that he would provide a resilient and effective government.
Instead of the increasingly witty words of the Liberal Democrat acting chairman, the once feared Mr. Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The reckless rescue of the troubled bank Northern Rock has revealed weakness in management and poor judgment under fire.
The ill-conceived proposals to change the tax code have brought the corporations together against the government.
The leak of 25 million people's personal data exposed unimaginable administrative indiscretions.
A trio of retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending, claiming that being commander of the armed forces was a part-time job.
Now here are the many-faced gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and their former internal disciplinary warden), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for his end.
Even so, governments can reach a tipping point beyond which they find governance difficult.
People don't trust politicians and they don't like them, but they usually shift their distrust when a new party takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to make a difference, and may not even be in office for long, this displacement goes away: the state administration becomes hollow, ministers start to do briefings, the press searches for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one respect, Mr. Brown's position is particularly challenging, since he cannot take on the role of the new broomstick, as opposed to other political leaders.
As much as he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the Northern Rock problems and the IRS records are tied to decisions Mr. Brown made as Secretary of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in the Blairite scandals, such as the long-running investigation into party funding caused by "money for money" scandals, voters can safely assume that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they seem.
These excesses are not as terrible as the conservatives make them out to be.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been deliberately deceived.
And the cure, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and lightly brutal rule.
The recent political gift-giving riot is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who equates his donations with charity, says he didn't want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't his.
The laws against the anonymity of major political donors are clear, and they exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might be buying access to those who govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams's move, but didn't know it was illegal, will certainly be questioned thoroughly; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour fundraiser, who learned of the devious gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not implicated; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about the scams, even though the bulk of the payments occurred after his June appointment.
The Prime Minister has done half the work.
The court very quickly condemned this violation of the law by its own party, but diluted its determination by looking for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led, moreover, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not difficult.
If there's been a breach of the law, it's a matter for the police.
And there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, like find a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been without one for six months, and move forward with real reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour, which is in trouble, to cooperate with the Tories and perhaps to give up their special financial relationship with the union - a bitter pill for a dedicated party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face some simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to extort victory is with unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis affecting the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally start to flutter around excitedly.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is crashing, predators have turned their attention to the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other forms of consumer credit were to be infected by subprime mortgages.
The voltage signals are obvious.
The number of defaults (over 30 days late) and of written-offs (bills considered by the provider to be unenforceable) is increasing.
HSBC last month announced that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market, partly due to insolvent credit card loans.
It's too early to panic.
The accounts written and the defaulted are still small.
According to Moody's, the default rate of 3,89% in the third quarter was almost one percentage point below the average.
The deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore rise regardless of whether general conditions for lenders have worsened.
The industry also has a good repayment rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts each month.
And trust in securities backed by credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways for infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when loans to real estate assets dry up, consumers are more likely to borrow via credit cards.
However, credit card issuers look at cash flow rather than collateral, so falling home prices may not necessarily change lenders' credibility.
They may even be advantageous to the lender.
The motivation of consumers to repay mortgages declines when the value of their property falls below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt moves up the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to more volatile conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or borrowing limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risks of rapid price changes of the products in question.
"We're not going to just one fine morning and reassess all of the loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
Although the risk of a sub-prime explosion is low, the danger of a gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron
Three British bankers who were due to stand trial for their roles in a fraud involving former Enron CFO Andrew Fastow changed their plea to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud, in which they were accused of participating with Fastow in a financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves at the expense of their employers.
They were due in court in January.
However, during their trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein, Jr., each of them confessed to one fraud.
The case of the three former senior executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was front-page news for two years during the issuing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished parts of the investigation that began after the Enron crash in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron collapse.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "The NatWest Three" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraud with Fastow and his former chief associate, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a subsidiary of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of the Enron fraud scandal that spiralled Enron into bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank valued its stake in the branch at zero, but our three British people knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's interest in this branch for $1 million.
The bankers in question paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
The indictment alleges that Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in this subsidiary of Greenwich NatWest.
But the 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers were awarded $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper and others were awarded approximately $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month at the Texarkanan facility.
All three Britons were free on $1 million bail, which ordered them to remain in the United States for the forthcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks no longer allowed it to hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has wiped out thousands of jobs, over $60 billion in market value, and over $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving more than a 24-year sentence.
Lay's convictions on conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died of a heart attack last year.
Moscow's not-powerlessness
The price of a Gulfstream G550 with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, it's a small change.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers", says Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many positions because it's for the close family or the company president".
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Fair, a four-day orgy of extravagant consumption at the mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
Besides Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers set up their booths, hoping to lure newly wealthy Russians to everything from mahogany-laden yachts to diamond-encrusted car windows that 50 Cent wouldn't be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer was looking carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but we're up against the fives and the tens", he said.
"Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft after the United States".
Oil waves are pouring money into the Russian capital, just like they did in Dallas.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans became enormously wealthy and moved to Europe, where they were looked at as materialists", said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at Harvard's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi spenders of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for a share of this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of luxury industry leaders, Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Group, came together to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a combined net worth of $282 billion.
Moreover, the country's leading research institute, the Center for Economic and Financial Research, has released a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, which shows that there are 103,000 "second-tier" millionaires in Russia, with a total net worth of $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative at David Morris's London jewelry store.
She was at the show for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly groomed and men are each for a fortune".
As they strolled around in evening robes on Sunday night, Evgenia Yumatov, 21, and Svetlana Turkovkovkov, five years her senior, declared themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking at these cars and I can't decide between an Infiniti, a Mercedes and a Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, who dressed in designer clothes like a veteran red carpet, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a housewife.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the newly rich, brand-driven Russian shoppers who are willing to sit in traffic for hours to walk through a warehouse that screams Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made pool tables, Dubai apartments, Gund plushes and propellers.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a life-size, hand-painted blue-tiled reproduction of Rembrandt's painting.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the gold".
Indeed, local vendors say that Russians with old money (by Russian standards, 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logs to little-known limited-edition brands that would never make it to the shopping fair.
Still, thousands of people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the fairgrounds every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil Beds, reported that he sold two sets of silk, cashmere and cotton mattresses, with gold threads, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager for A1 Moto, which outfits high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car customizer, announced that he had sold three Rolls-Royce Phantoms in the form of linked chain bracelets for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a car wheel designed for a Russian casino owner, which had a casing covered in Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
Price: 22,000 dollars for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich skin wheels or a portrait of his wife made of cubic zirconia doesn't need to ride those wheels", said Mr Karapetian.
"He stores them in his garage for 30 to 40 cars".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" doesn't mean anything exclusive these days, given the huge increase in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who are not millionaires could at least feign wealth at a stand operated by the Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company erected four red British-style telephone booths filled with piles of counterfeit bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said that his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires Fair.
Passengers stopped to throw around piles of money, or to have friends take their cell phone photos of them relaxing in the middle of alternative wealth, or to simply pocket a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may be due to a botched surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local restaurant a little bit healthier and watched the ambulance come to a white New England cottage two houses down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car joined in.
And then another.
"Then I saw the coroner's van arrive", said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"I knew someone had died".
Authorities have identified the dead woman as Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity the police have declined to disclose, who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine the cause of Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a wave of grief through the Newark police department.
Ms. Arroy had been the assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and hard-working", Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would have protected me".
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroy, a former New York City police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she was survived by two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romanko, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroy died from the effects of an unlicensed surgical procedure.
"It's one of the options", said Miss Walsh.
"Investigation is still ongoing".
Authorities say they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. on the 21st.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities have said little about their investigation or the home's alleged owner, Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if a portion of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with the ruined rose bush in the front yard and the dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading to the basement, in an open garage, was a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes were hanging from the rafters on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Miss Arroy provided invaluable assistance in navigating the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this or that,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing".
The hope that the Fed will cut interest rates is driving the world's stock markets to strengthen.
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic soared yesterday as market hopes that the Federal Reserve will try to ease lending conditions by further cutting interest rates were bolstered by soothing remarks from the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Stocks have jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In an apparent bid to calm jittery markets amid signs of a resurgent credit effort, Mr Kohn said the recent turmoil had "partially reversed some improvements in market performance in late September and October".
It also stated that if the increased volatility persists, there is a greater likelihood that the financial situation of households and firms will further deteriorate.
Investors are taking these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver fresh capital injections to the US markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts, to stabilize lending conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid further bad news about the U.S. economy, as October's home sales were at a record low.
The effects of the financial whirlwind were underscored by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost-cutting to offset heavy losses caused by a failed bid to provide subprime mortgages in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be closed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index gained 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 gained 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, with the value of Britain's blue-chips rising by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German index Dax rose 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
A while ago, the credit crunch came to a head after the European Central Bank's three-month money package auction saw these funds lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and dump surplus money on London's money markets has increased with the three-month British interbank LIBOR rates rising to their highest since the end of September - 6.59 percent, after rising uninterruptedly since 12 November.
England has to decide between Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara.
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be batting number six for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who has held the post on borrowed time at best, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, helping with decision-making, and because the desk of Hugh Morris, the general manager of the England team, is beginning to fill with applications for the post of national selector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
Whoever doesn't make it to sixth on the batting order will be unlucky, but life is often not fair, and sports certainly are not.
It's not easy to find what gets one person to the top of their profession while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
It's not just cricket that makes choices difficult and requires judgment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to the Shah, if it is?
We could ask the same question in other areas, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both bright young executives with good education and industry oversight, should be promoted to the board - there's only one place.
Who's to say what level is right for a cricketer when he can't possibly fall or swim to the next?
Of course, numbers have a huge impact on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In a team, the cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right moment if he is to take a wicket, and the batsman needs regular chances at starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the look of a collector is more complicated.
For example, last season there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself fit and pitches as a bowler.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 overs each.
Chris Tremlett, with his equally meager average, only took 29 but both had their moments at the top and are hoping for another.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may either start or end your career, or it may not have a big impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every Test and in first class he was delivering good performances, five wickets and 40 off-spins, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was fighting for his place at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who, moreover, despite scoring two hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It's more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion following today's practice at the Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer the Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
Shaha speaks for his sparkling and valuable Test debut of 88 runs in Mumbai and 32 first-class hundreds against Bopar's six, who, at twenty-two, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin bowlers.
However, Shah made just ten overs in two innings in May against the Caribbean in a Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, and this, coupled with the immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan wanted to re-sign him for the next match, his dismissal seemed to take away some of the drive that was so evident in Bombay.
Essex University, on the other hand, has a joie de vivre in the bones.
He's unstoppable on the cricket pitch, and his off-the-field behaviour is symbolic of a recently overturned four-wheel drive car at the exhibition day of the English team's automotive sponsor, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (which was also sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching from afar, and excitedly ask him, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better on the field, his medium-fast slips on the pitches here that seem to suit him, he delivers effectively and he shoots confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the true art of choice.
Personally, I'm leaning towards giving Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that the Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves indicate, he's the one playing here next weekend.
Buses bringing refugees back to work and to fight al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, picking up refugees who had run out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who had driven them from their homes.
Mansour bus station was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan returning by private transport, before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad", said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, because of what was going on in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi's army has stopped killing people", he said, referring to the militia of the Shiite militant cleric Mukta'd al-Sadr, who had temporarily ordered his men to cease fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni area of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariah called him saying that the local militia, with the support of the US military, had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who was driven from his home in Slekhu, north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The day before yesterday, I got a call from some friends telling me that they were starting a militia in Sligo against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and my boys to support them.
That's why I came back today", said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken of the appeal of the city's calming after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of concerned citizens" who are defending their neighborhoods with arms held by the U.S. military.
But more talk about how they were forced to return by visa and money-shortage obstacles in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, has spoken out against the suspicion shared by refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, has asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled the sectarian murders in Iraq.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis so they would have to return to Iraq", said the Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left".
Part of the reason for the easing of violence is the fact that Sunnis have been pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Sarria, good education
The smallest of the German federal states plays a leading role in vocational education, even excelling in the international focus of its universities.
In only one area of education does Saarland suffer from the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To the man who is not from the Saar, I explained yesterday for the fiftieth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in the Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest federal state.
In this respect, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarajevo education system, which is ranked fifth in the Cologne Institute for Economic Research's (IW) monitoring of education.
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Even today, students can graduate with a double or even a triple degree.
This corresponds to a fairly high proportion of international students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Sarawak children are admitted to higher education - many of them without even having attended a grammar school.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland", says Axel Plünnecke, an IW education expert.
With more than one in five young people being admitted to vocational training, the Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland offers a wealth of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities for studying two subjects are the second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite the practical-oriented education and the increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
So the Sara Ministry of Education has now ordered the colleges to create a promotional campaign for engineering majors.
"After the first Pisa study, we have implemented several reforms in general education schools", says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
The government therefore introduced benchmarking tests throughout Germany.
To ensure that children start learning as early as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other federal states are also adopting.
If the pupils' performance improves significantly, future comparative studies will show.
In the Pisa study carried out in 2003, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are better at counting.
And to Sárska's disappointment, the Pisa studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Sárska could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in secondary schools - even if the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chavez is moving the clock
Soon, the clocks in Venezuela will be different from the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chavez will turn the clocks back half an hour in this South American country.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chavez is becoming a ridiculous figurehead.
Venezuela's official newspaper reported that the new law will shift the clock back to the world's time by four and a half hours.
The South American country will be a step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the United States, explained his decision, among other things, by saying that the United States had forced the world to divide into time zones throughout the hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday at midnight local time that he was cutting ties with neighboring Colombia over the hostage crisis.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't anymore because of my self-confidence", said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of this oil-rich country must vote on in a Sunday referendum.
This reform would have greatly strengthened Chavez's power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe's decision to revoke Chavez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe "spit in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, criticizing Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
A new mobile phone ringing has caused a stir here: "Por qué no te callas" - that's the phrase that has been downloaded by more than half a million people.
It was uttered by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was so incensed by the left-wing populist's loud remarks at the recent Ibero-American summit that he was silenced in this way.
Germans at risk of pay cuts in 2007
German employees are forecast to face a reduction in real wages this year, despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have given a number of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 people in employment can realistically expect to receive less than last year's wage.
"It is the small wage increases, the increase in value-added tax and the increase in food and energy prices that are to blame", said Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) research institute, to the newspaper Bild.
New burdens may also be imposed on employees in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year was right and reasonable in this situation.
The Federal Labour Agency should not again be in such a predicament as to have to ask the youth of the Federal Government for loans or grants, the newspaper quoted this social democratic politician as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and oil products had driven inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
On a year-on-year basis, prices increased by 3% overall.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought. The European Venus Express spacecraft has detected phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and whirlpoles at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus flashes.
The European spacecraft Venus Express has now provided evidence - electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere, with lightning flashing from cloud to cloud at about 35 miles [56 km] above the surface of Venus, writes Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific journal Nature.
The famous theory of primordial matter suggests that lightning may have given rise to life on Earth, and that storms triggered reactions in the oceans that resulted in the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
This was not the case on Venus: "If there was life there, it must have been a long time ago", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, life on the surface of Venus would be almost impossible, with an atmosphere about 100 times denser than Earth's, and sometimes reaching temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the hell twin of Earth, but it's the hell twin", Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve in a completely different way is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
Since no probe has been sent to Venus for study purposes alone since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 marked a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest research, reported in several articles of Nature, has not only highlighted the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also show that our neighboring planet is more Earthlike than previously thought", Esa said.
In addition to the already known winds at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that spins much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica, Italy.
The second innermost planet in our solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is nearly as large at 12,100 kilometers in diameter.
This planet, known as Dawn or Evening, orbits the sun in just over 225 days.
But it rotates much more slowly on its axis, taking one day on Venus to equal 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble Earth in its surface temperature of 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit [460°C] and pressure of 92 bars, scientists believe that the two planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while Venus evaporated into space.
Whereas carbon dioxide on Earth is bound up in carbonates on Earth, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
President Koehler is calling for an end to the party dispute over the Dalai Lama's acceptance into the chancellery.
He was implicitly critical of the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and is calling on the grand coalition to end the quarrel over the Dalai Lama's acceptance.
"We should not present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue", Köhler told the Handelsblatt business newspaper.
He also expressed his understanding of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"While I respect cultural differences, for me human rights are universal", said Köhler.
The German President stressed that everyone knew that Germany had to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not prevent him from defending Merkel when she was criticized for creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not departed from the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows it too", Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his disagreement with the Dalai Lama's acceptance and has been attacked from within the coalition.
Among other things, Steinmeier complained about the coalition's "predictive" foreign policy.
Since the Dalai Lama's accession to the Chancellery, German-Chinese relations have deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation to German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the Dalai Lama's acceptance was a mistake.
China disapproves when European politicians formally accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also in China, is trying to separate itself from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that has broken out in France
Street fights with police, shootings, cars set on fire, Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that have erupted in France.
We must do everything to prevent social unrest in Germany from turning into street violence, urges the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades were burning, rioters firing shotguns at police, and after serious youth unrest in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful that we do not create social tensions that lead to violence.
We must take it seriously", he told the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with the rapidly changing social realities.
The Federal Government, the Länder and the municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
And that doesn't mean just integrating migrants.
"We have seen the first successes since the integration summit after the Islamic conference".
But for now, caution is still in order.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In the past few nights, juveniles and police have engaged in violent street fighting in the northern suburbs of Paris.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were burned.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "copying effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as volatile as in France.
But it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among people under 25 who come from migrant families is "above average".
First of all, more study opportunities must be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people hope".
The chairman of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike in France, there is more social control of families.
Moreover, many young people from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
"However", Kolat admonished, "we must be careful".
We must "enable young people to enter employment and education quickly".
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly calm.
Hundreds of police were deployed, and a helicopter with flashlights flew over the area.
Authorities have reported three arrests and several burned garbage bins and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 law enforcement officers have been deployed to keep the peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, announced after a visit to the suburbs of the interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, riots swept through Toulouse.
The disorder was caused by a car accident on Sunday, which took the lives of two teenagers.
According to the preliminary findings of the State Attorney's Office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the teenagers.
In the realm of the "Cloud" Angels
The chancellor's far-from-reality exit documents that the coalition is programmatically at an end and that we can't expect anything more from her either.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and poorly worded speech at the General Debate of the Bundestag, we have to say: not here - not in this country, which she should be running after all.
To the regret that she was too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once replied with a very arrogant phrase.
It's provincial, she said, showing she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
In the Bundestag, she has made it clear how much she deserves to be reprimanded.
Merkel's not feeling any real interest, let alone a sense for the country's problems.
Instead, there was Angela "Cloud": a politician who stands out from the crowd, who escapes into foreign policy and even there speaks only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And, in general, such an arrogance - so much immodesty the CDU chairman would have forgiven herself two years ago.
Now she's confined to empty phrases that might increase her popularity among the people.
This approach damages her image as a pragmatist who doesn't need to be flattered because she solves problems.
But in the realm of Angela "Cloud" domestic political issues are a peripheral matter.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
She's got a few more lines on these subjects.
It is noteworthy how often Merkel is referred to as the "children's allowance".
Three times, Merkel has to start from the beginning to get the sentence at least partially right.
Once things get too concrete, he stumbles into a totally foreign terrain.
The Attack Unit
The Republican presidential debate on YouTube has turned into a heated debate in the case of the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already apparent in the first issue.
Mitt Romney is accusing his rival Rudy Guilani of turning New York into a "haven for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with a sharp rebuke: "I suspect his own house was just one such haven", he responds, implying to the former governor of Massachusetts that he was privately employing undocumented immigrants.
With the Republican base still unchallenged, eight of the presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The half-minute videos, shot by Internet users and uploaded via YouTube, serve only as such clues to the key topic.
"It was precisely this policy of isolationism that allowed Hitler to seize power", John McCain suggests to his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one pushing for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain is also saving Romney from the whiplash of his own refusal to condemn the torture interrogation method called "waterboarding", which involves simulated heat.
The reaction of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that the campaign's important issues are neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture.
The audience erupts in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are denied.
It'll show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong then", explains Romney, and apologizes to the party base and the television audience for being a proponent of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on a literal interpretation of the Bible.
# # Musharraf rules for the first time as a civilian
The day after stepping down as commander-in-chief, Pakistan's ruler, Musharraf, was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
President of Pakistan Parviz Musharraf took the presidential oath on Thursday, and will remain in office for the next five years.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to uphold the Constitution and to work for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby submitting to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, a former general is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf has fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Chief Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after taking the oath, fulfilling another of the West's demands.
The country's highest court, which was filled by pro-Musharaf lawyers after the state of emergency was declared in early November, last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the Northern Vaziristan tribal region.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a highway near the Afghan border.
The father of the little girl is coming back
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again, with three members of the band Harmonia once again grabbing their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already much more famous abroad.
The reported sensation then consists of the performance of three seated gentlemen who at first appear to be enjoying a meal.
Each has a box, cables, and most of all, buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, in a snow-white shirt, is sitting in the middle.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, leaning over the synthesizer in focus, is on the right from the audience's perspective.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by accident, they become a traditional song.
It seems that the musicians don't mind that much.
The revival of Harmonia has caused quite a stir among Krautrock fans.
One thing that's worth noting here is that the repeated questions have shown that while the name is part of the collective pop consciousness, it's certainly not so commonplace that someone has been sorely missing the band for 23 years.
But why can't the German celebrate his still-living legends of the '70s?
And especially when they value the musical style, misnamed krautrock, in England and America more than in their own country.
When the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne-based band Can the Echo Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003, the hall was filled with questionable views from German pop fans.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! for their performance, the audience's wonder was boundless.
Michael Rother would later sit onstage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
The Harmony band is a bit of a memory-burdening, but the trio existed for only two years and even then had no impact that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
They first played in the basement of the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, with a gramophone company run by the church.
Rother briefly assisted Kraftwerk, but gained fame as the guitarist of Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster into exile in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who had fled the city.
They didn't have the same ideological life here as in the I-community, where Roedelius was still allowed to work as a nanny.
It was more like a life in a kind of Spitzweger artistic being.
The name for the artwork is allegedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir, whose badge was allegedly found in the trash.
A lot of it was preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and humble, the band was suffering from financial difficulties.
The gathering of the grass was not just about self-knowledge.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was recorded in front of a record-setting small backstage of barely 50 people at a concert in Griessem.
Rothera had expressed his wish that the members of Harmony get out and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlia and Moebius, it was a completely impolite request.
In 1975, the band announced their break-up.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmony ever was.
We can thank Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griesemmer.
His record label, Grönland, has made it its mission to preserve krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The Neu! band was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
Harmony's bodily resurrection will take place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
In attendance is British, Julian Cope, old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, is also attending.
So we've outlined the overall breadth of Krautrock's influence on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Eno's verse, accompanied by the strangest of sounds, is heard in the hall: "The only true music, it's the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in the peasant's seat.
The legend is further fueled by the projection of other black-and-white photographs of a set of devices wired together wildly.
Before that, the three veterans are rehired to improvise.
No longer do I glue microphones to organ and drums to eject from instruments those never-before-heard, homemade tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of submersion point-squatters.
The choir at the House of World Cultures won't change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, a whispering is heard beneath the sound clouds, and in one beautiful spot, the emphatic "Aaaaaaaa!" is sung.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock 'n' roll.
We'd find its roots in music colleges (Can), technology (Kraftwerk) or escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster) rather than in blues.
Whoever's yelling '68' in this place is not so far off the mark, but Harmonia is not letting herself be taken for granted even now.
Even the most obvious is thought through on stage.
Where does the music begin and end?
This question either drains a person of his nerves or allows him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But none of them are convincing.
The premise of the films either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too emotional.
That's not gonna happen in The Hunting Party, not with an actor like Richard Gere.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is there, in the murky backdrop of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
We've lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played many pleasant, insignificant roles in comfortable women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences on Buddhism, one can't help but want to see another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party.
Gere delivers a magical performance, his war correspondent Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful: a man who, while his best years are long gone, still retains a remarkable charm as a ruin-like memorial.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, also coming to theaters this week, is just the continuation of an endless string of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, after which one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not portrayed as the cause of all evil, this television-shallow film is turning too soon into a shooting and action.
It's gonna be a Cobra 11 movie, but without the highway, and with the war.
The Hunting Party is a very good way of looking at why the Balkan War has never been made into a really good movie.
The story of three American war reporters posing as the "fox", a Serbian war criminal, could have become a new "Apocalypse" in another time and under a different director and writer (both Richard Shepard).
After all, both stories have a surprising similarity: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army cannot do, but their journey becomes the road to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the drunken, sentimental cynic depicted at the beginning.
On the contrary, the premise further prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can finally be written off after the reporters in the last five fast-paced minutes of the film succeed in what NATO, the CIA and all the world's crime-hunters have failed in the last five years: to catch the criminal and leave him to the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
Yet this film has a deeply human message.
It deplores the fact that Karadzic and Mladić are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (who are exceptionally united) of not being intensive enough in their persecution, based on secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, that we think of Brecht's famous poem.
It's about a wooden mask of an Asian demon on a writer's desk: "I look with pity at the swollen veins on my forehead, noting: how tiring it is to be evil".
In movies like The Hunting Party, they have exactly these kind of head-pounding, but they do suggest how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the Balkan war.
Recently, this newspaper said that all the Hollywood movies about Iraq were big failures.
There's only one thing to add to that: No good movie has ever been made about South Africa.
Almost always, when a star wanders through a crisis zone or walks through a minefield, it creates a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, The Breakthrough with Angelina Jolie or The Bludgeons with Leonard DiCaprio.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films must have been lost - films now considered classics in Vietnam - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "The Leather Vest" - were not celebrated as masterpieces at all.
But maybe today, when every mass murder in our home is instantly on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
And screenwriters don't have the skill that's needed to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To Be or Not to Be" and "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin had not yet learned how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be good to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to develop a sarcastically measured artistic vision like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said: "The only similarity is that some things never change.
Big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is criticized for denying the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has been met with a flurry of criticism from politicians and economists.
Many want to continue fighting for the water games.
But von Beust is a realist in his estimation of chance.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called the decision "unfortunate from a business point of view".
No other project has recently aroused so much enthusiasm in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, it would not have been possible to sustain this political enthusiasm for sport at such a high level".
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on an altered timetable".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday to his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide the Olympic candidate", von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Federation will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the Winter Games in 2018.
"This preference means that with a 2028 timetable, we have no realistic chance".
Yet, this dream is not yet over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's comments regrettable.
Hamburg seems to have no interest in hosting the Olympics for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to ruin the chances by calling plans buried at this early stage", HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The refusal of the appointment would be contrary to the testimony of the head of the senate, which he made at the general meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust hereby declined to announce Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiade as a replacement for the Olympic Games.
The university sports federation of Hamburg just last week nominated a candidate city.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg parliament, the Senate, complained that it was wasting valuable time that could be used for the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been held up by the Senate for years because it has bet on the Olympics and excluded housing", said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD still planned the Olympics for the Klein Grasbrook area, with the entire area later to be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The bidding for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused a great deal of excitement in Hamburg at the time.
But the Hamburg was wrecked off Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol boxes.
Anyone who combines the words Sweden and wooden boxes is not thinking of Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or is it?
The wooden boxes now produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the 94 Stockholm-type "Brillo boxes" on his list are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen raised doubts a few months ago about the authenticity of Warhol's 1968 "Brillo boxes", an internal investigation by Moderna Museet in Stockholm has come up with a disconcerting result: the six "Brillo boxes" donated to Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - as are most of the other "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type that circulate on the international art market.
The events that preceded it are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting the wooden boxes based on the red-and-white design of Brillo's soap-powder paper boxes.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 featured - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo cardboard cases, which were not made by Warhol (for financial reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about the artwork, it was about the models, the exhibits.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to have several wooden Brillo cases made in Sweden, but these are not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time now speak of 15 boxes that then rightfully entered art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the Stockholm type.
Some of these have been sold at auctions for over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968 about 100 boxes had been made and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were made in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrograd only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and had their base plates painted and coated with a brush and painted with oil white.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, shows that the paint was applied directly to the plywood by the painter's roller without any prior basic coating - and it is an acrylic paint rather than an oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list", Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve said: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York reaches a different conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to classify six of its exhibition boxes as 'exhibition material - copies.'"
Back in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would be addressing these "major allegations" that were raised in the soap powder boxes case.
But the organization has remained silent.
Rebel soldiers in Manila are surrendering
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered, entrenching themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebel leader Antonio Trillanes, who has denounced the president for election manipulation and corruption, told reporters at the hotel that he denies responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government earlier attacked the hotel with tear gas.
Hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had already entrenched themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were in court for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the meeting to flee with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to guard him apparently switched sides and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Government forces have sealed off the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an emergency cabinet meeting.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales has condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough", said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers, said that other military units would soon join the march.
Critics of the government have called for a large demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been accused of corruption for months.
The financial district of Manila became the main scene of a rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroy in 2003.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the uprising collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a majority shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has acquired more than 20% of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is €14.46.
The company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
There was speculation about a takeover before.
The company is always counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet announced that it was taking this step in order to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5% to 15,1%, entry agreements emerged on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it's said that this bank only holds shares for third parties.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold an additional 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for EUR 31.4 million.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the area of DSL and mobile network products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", explained a United Internet spokesperson.
In order to take over the competitor Freenet, the companies jointly established an SME joint venture.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies are satisfied with a share of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and will not exercise their right to acquire the remaining 18,49% of the business.
It is considered that the companies will keep all options open for the time being, in particular the possibility of further increasing their participation in Freenet AG.
The talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-translate Freenet game is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million mobile subscribers and 1,27 million customers with full or DSL connections.
United Internet Holding and Drillische previously held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it's been agreed that Drillisch will get approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18,49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed as early as August.
