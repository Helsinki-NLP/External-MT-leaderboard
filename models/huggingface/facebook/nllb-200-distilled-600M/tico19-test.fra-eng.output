Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care facilities need to prepare for a peak of COVID-19 patients requiring care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of unknown pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control identified the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which is curable.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 leads to more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution in Hubei province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the 5 March 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
This data was used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with the experience in Italy.
To assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over 14 days, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Developments in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The development of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over 14 days in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February before rising sharply around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, as of 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are in different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media reports reported that hospitals and intensive care facilities in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not submitted).
However, it is necessary to carry out a systematic collection in order to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study in 201011 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100 000 people in 2010).
Modelling scenarios for care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with a risk of 90% overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM's rapid COVID-19 risk assessment.
Since cases have hitherto been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally have a defined regional population, case and intensive care bed data should preferably be set at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
Experience in Italy and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the recent Rapid Risk Assessment by the CPCM, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from an anti-cancer approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in cases may not allow enough time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been done in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country can step up its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2, has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this examination will help us to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 marked the end of the Chinese people, who were forced to remain in isolation for the entire week and for long weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease is known as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak started in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is the number one public enemy, potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 showing the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research on this new and booming subject.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also review what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and address some still pending but urgent issues.
Coronavirus are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds 4.
However, during this century, we have seen two highly pathogenic coronavirus for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia of then unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the outbreak had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined with all public transport interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the outbreak as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was spreading in homes, mainly in Hubei province and outlying areas.
The average time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9 days).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean time between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincides with the massive displacement that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus are a subfamily of large wrapped viruses containing a single strand of RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The Spike (S) glycoprotein in the envelope binds to the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been established to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with over 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequentially sampled samples taken from the outbreak's origin site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human LACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by lorf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by lorf8.
SARS-CoV-2 Lorf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit lIFNβ expression; however, lorf8 contains no known functional domains or patterns.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the full human ACE2 cryo-ME structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were established to be from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camellids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, bats were promoted as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronavirus from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be elucidated.
Ji et al. hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would have involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-muzzled mammal that feeds on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a gap of 1% between two genomes is a difference of importance; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence should be expected (Fig.
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to a temperature of 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other solvents, but not fatty chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronavirus, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
The virus induces inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation and synthesis of type I interferons (TII) by various means, which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
T cells help produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing apoptosis.
Humor immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, to multiviscereal failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a home onset, is more likely to affect older people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are at higher risk of becoming infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but generally 3 to 7 days after a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded that an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) was observed in a demographic of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the actual duration of quarantine to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days ?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest x-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that 98 percent of patients had fever, 76 percent had dry cough, 55 percent had dyspnea and 3 percent had diarrhea; 8 percent of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of a family and a household that developed from transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% of patients needed ventilation assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with a higher mortality rate from MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS, the main symptoms were found to be fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) and ventilation assistance was needed in approximately 14-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, for 66,576 confirmed cases globally.
In comparison, the mortality rate for SARS in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a population study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2-4
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table Table1.1.
The data above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be virus carriers without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients recovered may be virus carriers again, which highlights the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4 × 109/L and a lymphocyte count of 1 × 109/L, as well as high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had high levels of hepatic enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin found in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Breast X-ray abnormalities are seen in most COVID-19 patients, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or a pale opacity of glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes dysfunction leads to a decrease in the rate of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocytes disqualification, hyaline membranes formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multi-nuclear syncytic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincided with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and was similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false-negatives, which can accelerate the outbreak, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer solely based on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which allows for the identification of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive tape in less than an hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will greatly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other ACE2-expressing organs such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and insufficient breathing are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been established that an excessive immune system response leads to cytokine shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiviscereal failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shock, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shock include modulation of the immune response by T cells, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor and dHDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroid use did not have any beneficial effects on severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect prognosis.
Nevertheless, the careful use of short cycles of low to moderate dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with a severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead has transferred the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ ritonavir combination and ribavirin have been promoted as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur as a result of combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, combined with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause an excessive boost in the immune response and cause a cytokine-release syndrome, potentially fatal.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma for treating seriously ill patients is high.
It's difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes coding for the relevant antibodies or to look for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow for rapid growth in antibody production.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known at all as they are difficult to extract and verify, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of a specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The best COVID-19 recovery rates were seen in provinces in China that used TCM for 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu province (63.7 percent), Ningxia region (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei province, which only used up to 30 percent of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13 percent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing a treatment using Western medicine (WMD) only to a combined treatment combining WMD and TCM.
It was found that the time taken to return to normal body temperature, the time taken to resolve symptoms and the time taken to be hospitalized were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptom aggravation (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, the mortality rate was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM remains to be ascertained through controlled trials conducted at larger scale and at more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally experience a strong concern about the highly contagious and deadly disease, and those quarantined also experience feelings of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS outbreak, multiple psychiatric illnesses were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact search and quarantine, as part of public health services' response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt among patients over the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their family and friends.
Mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and precise updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection remain to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably because SARS died out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
However, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using the inactive virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unimmunised individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the ongoing outbreak.
However, this is a real challenge because of the long time (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations in coronavirus.
As it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution across thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table (Table33):
Age: Age was the main factor in the prognosis of SARS, and this seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% over 50 years old according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to lACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between CRP rate and severity as well as the prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), daspartate aminotransferase (AST), dalanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be involved in the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, including the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
They are therefore traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest x-ray results and the time progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in conjunction with other factors to determine the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in the treatment of infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroid use has been widely used for severe SARS cases, many survivors have had avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a large number of cases of exceptional stress, often with patients experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty and the death of loved ones or other patients.
It is essential to offer psychological support and longterm support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and causes little or no symptoms in the first stage of infection, like the common cold-causing coronavirus.
Therefore, individuals who are recently infected or in incubation can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which greatly hinders the control of the outbreak.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the lockdown of Wuhan and nearby cities, and the continuous quarantine of almost all the population to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the outbreak.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the outbreak will end in March and that the decline phase will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not go away in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outbreak's outcome and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the middle nasal cornea and throat samples of recovered patients 2 weeks after they were released from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode as soon as the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been seen in China with the gradual decline in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
Initial forecasts suggested that the Ebola virus would cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectiousness and eventually become extinct or that it will evolve into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and also possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stool, revealing a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including healthcare professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who may be in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first possible line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (1860) provide protection against 10 to 80 nm inhalation of viruses, with only 5% of viruses able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eyes due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or contact lenses to patients.
For the populations of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined as much as possible and to limit contact with potentially infected persons.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre from the sick.
These measures are effective ways of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, must have placed China in a high state of alert following the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was low-contagious, had limited human transmission and would not be difficult to prevent and contain.
This message led to a notable release, particularly as the whole country prepared for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
The Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential early-stage epidemic rather than try to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases among the population, but also to regularly test and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing, it has spread to all of China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak is a preview.
However, there are notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the outbreak and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 percent versus 1.44 percent).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, whereas SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients who recover may be positive for the virus again.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical questions remain pending, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a genetic homology of 96 percent has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus from bats, this is not enough to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originated from chiropractors.
What is the intermediate species that allowed transmission of the virus from the original host, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission and the outbreak can resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the outbreak last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all these questions and many others.
However, no matter what the costs may be, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period for both viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
Apart from the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with the peak of viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, misdiagnosis of liver function and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities seen in laboratory tests for suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages have also been observed in patients with SARS.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been devoted to research into HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of this same virus from the nasal samples of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
As with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory illnesses.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS clinical manifestations are similar to SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30 percent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest known viruses in humans.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community-based HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a proportion sufficient to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the restriction factors of the host.
In this context, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the higher the number of people infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If adapted well, transmission between men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the population, causing a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses don't need an animal tank.
However, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among them without a reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host for an HCoV if it is home to a close ancestor with a high homology in nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is nonpathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts HCoVs continuously and long term.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, as 80% of animals on the Guangzhou market have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate relative of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Therefore, bats cannot be the intermediate host for MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries were HIV-positive to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as were camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal tract, which is also the main route of excretion for bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than the distance between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs from the pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could both be derived from the bat-like VC, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been genetically associated with another bat-like COVID-19 virus, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camellids have also been suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of the bat have been found close to HCoV-229E.
First, unlike alpacas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Next, the bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV from the alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV of alpaca has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility is that while bat alpha-CoVs serve as a genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts for transmitting the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of species-to-species transmission from bats to bats and from bats to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known from its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It was well suited for camels who had moved from intermediate hosts to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, the beta-CoVs of pangolin are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for species-to-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host for a SARS-CoV-2 virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through the cutting or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which an SARS-CoV-2-related virus was recently introduced.
Humans get the virus through the slicing and eating of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research into the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single strand RNA viruses, estimated VC mutation rates could be considered as  moderate  to  high  with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the VC to new hosts.
However, the mutation rates of the VOCs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the VOCs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will render SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals ineffective in the short term.
Third, the CoVs change patterns randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique  copy-selection  mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for the animal-observed CoVs, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is typical here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit S means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity of this linkage 10 to 20 times greater than that observed between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to lACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as Laminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, rodents and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to square one
The diversity of bats' CVDs offers many opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this sense, bat VOCs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the SARS-CoV ancillary proteins, lORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but encoded with divergent ORF8 proteins.
This removal divides lORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is presumed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV outbreak has experienced recombination episodes between different strains, which occurred among dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of alpaca has a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted on their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the C.V.s from an anatomical and physiological standpoint.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the VOCs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RDOs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of the VOC and affect the 'reading' by the exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoVs could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their tank hosts such as bats and camels.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets lie of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was divided by the replication of the COVID-19.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is not successful in bats.
Based on this reasoning, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-mouse-CoV with 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat-CoV with 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The VOCs have returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around for a long time in the dromedary.
Camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are very common in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, together with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the VCs of bats, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been around the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity arises for contagion.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches of natural zoonotic reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is a true intermediate host, it remains to be seen how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the near-identical virus relatives seen in their natural hosts.
It is possible to get respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. your mucous membranes).
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
The Commission has also proposed a new approach to the reduction of infant mortality rates in home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading causes of death among children under five years of age, is the leading cause of death for nearly 1.8 million children a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor harmful effects, frequent hand washing can damage the skin causing dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or skin dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common in healthcare workers.
Too often washing hands is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deparasitism twice a year, combined with daily handwashing with soap and daily toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are hardly soluble in water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in the wild.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin-protective and stress-relieving agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the School of Public Health at the University of Oregon found that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for individuals and containing triclosan in preventing disease and eliminating hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in eliminating natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickener such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to produce a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to produce a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to moisten or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not strengthened by skin emollients and/or moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/ or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, emollient-containing hydroalcoholic solutions caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dermatitis or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizers for non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less soap.
Furthermore, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than curb them.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, when in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with running water, whether warm or cold.
Current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Splash a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse in plenty of running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can result in re-contamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.
Wet and wet hands are more likely to re-contaminate. The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
A moisturizer lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives to hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, running water from a suspended and pierced bucket or drain and/or using ash if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a cotton swab suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is debated.
Increasing research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194 percent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 percent on the palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42%, and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand drying has been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant towels is an alternative solution when travelling, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to mould and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The purpose of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
In this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after dealing with a sick person.
In the case of the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there was very little additional benefit to increasing hand washing frequency by more than 35%.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, hand washing taps are rare to find near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building hand washing stations.
However, low rates of handwashing can also be attributed to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to encourage behavioural change. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by fetid odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating good hand washing techniques were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression 'to wash one' refers to a person's refusal to accept responsibility or to be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of purification, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after every meal.
And all chest pains should be treated this way, especially at your age.

'Cause it's the flu season
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintentional changes in the genomes of viruses, which are most likely due to pressure exerted during selection, particularly by the host's immune system.
For example, the loss of complete ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to the deletion of two nucleotides, can be cited.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of alpaca has a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted on their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the C.V.s from an anatomical and physiological standpoint.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the VOCs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer receptor and by the low expression rate of the major class I histotocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RDOs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of the VOC and affect the 'reading' by the exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoVs could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their tank hosts such as bats and camels.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets lie of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was divided by the replication of the COVID-19.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is not successful in bats.
Based on this reasoning, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 emerged following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a beta-mouse-CoV with 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat-CoV with 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present in the markets have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by humans, either intentionally or accidentally.
The VOCs have returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of VHCs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets present in markets, the closure of fresh produce markets and the slaughter of civets present in them could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many pangolins' beta-CoV lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around for a long time in the dromedary.
Camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are very common in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, together with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the VCs of bats, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
Opportunities are not missing for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or lethal human CoVs in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan for preparation and response should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been around the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity arises for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics that are conducive to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches of natural zoonotic reservoirs.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if bats transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is a true intermediate host, it remains to be seen how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the near-identical virus relatives seen in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will help to elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Rapid Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, and our knowledge and knowledge is gradually progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a suspected case and a confirmed case according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To help fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge and knowledge is gradually progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have had a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou et al. who presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (Test Seventh Edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspected case must combine one of the characteristic elements of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a comprehensive analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological background: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive test for nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City or nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 weeks with fever and symptoms/respiratory symptoms such as reduced office space, less than 2 weeks in the classroom, less than 2 weeks in the classroom, less than 2 weeks in the schoolroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imagery showing the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating a normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with the newly known coronavirus; (3) positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or modification of the specific IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or an increase in the title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to that of the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody to the confirmed criteria.
Moreover, increasing evidence is reminding us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified non-clinical symptoms as low risk.
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases, we suggest that they follow and follow the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to offer its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a single day.
The country has a record number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (BIPRC) reported that the number of people infected recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered people, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always allowed.
On 19 March, the three had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city lockdown until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the 15-day national emergency; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially deadly an HCoV infection can be.
Most HCoVs come from bats that are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of host-CoV interactions in animals could also help to better understand humanCoV.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human co-ovs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of species barrier crossing.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier (s) of hosts, with important implications in preventing future infections.
Animal VCs have been known since the late 1930s.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow into WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the classical cold, including headache, sneezing, nausea and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20 percent of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present worldwide and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the quantity of toilet paper they can buy
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on purchasing toilet paper to two and one pack per purchase in all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-package limit.
These limits were posted as messages to the boxes and on the channels' Facebook pages.
Shoppers apparently were stockpiling stocks out of fear of COVID-19 and the need to lock themselves in.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its press release of 8 March, said that with the four-pack restriction in place, many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery, and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it unexpected.
Sales have been up steadily over the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco store in Canberra also restricted the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said retailers were trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made the task difficult.
It envisages higher production costs as suppliers try to meet demand and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early unlocking of stocks, some stores are unable to honour Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a distribution expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in small stocks which, when exhausted, leave large empty spaces in the beams, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
 Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the beams are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [bought] and are available in large quantities, this will likely reduce panic , Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent paper, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first auctioneer at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers were on holiday during the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page envelope intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March announcing that they had no plans to introduce any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited Andres toilet paper purchases to two 12-reel packages.
WHO calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 outbreak (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
Although the word  pandemic  refers only to the extent to which the disease spreads, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments to act:
 All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are to detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response , said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
 We are very concerned not only about alarming levels of spread and gravity but also about alarming levels of inactivity. 
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is unprecedented.
He said in remarks published by CNN in February that  apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued global spread.
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that we have never witnessed a coronavirus pandemic.
He added:  and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time. 
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak:  in short, the situation will get worse. 
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an outbreak of coronavirus disease that has been ongoing since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Almost 364,000 people are healed.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confining suspected infected persons.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious socioeconomic disruptions globally, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and others from regions with many cases of the virus.
The decrease in travel and closures in heavy industry has led to a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a new case of pneumonia from unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and so it is believed that the virus was zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first known person with symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no obvious connection to the subsequent fresh produce market.
Of the first home cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were linked to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that as new cases appeared to decline in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4 percent of cases worldwide.The chief scientific adviser to the UK, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 percent of the UK population would need to be infected before an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases are the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that up to 23 January, 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the time between symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% were suffering from pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual number of COVID-19 victims could be much higher, as it may not include those who have died untested - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveals that the survival rate during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official death toll from COVID.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged  We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated , a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of underestimation in the U.S. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14th.
On 28 February, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex and, above all, health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate was 6.0% (97,039,1 617 204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the death rate decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that occurred between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that occurred after 1 February 2020).
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population of infection after the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value in this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 tests in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on estimates of mortality rates.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said:  Without control, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease becomes unavailable.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant predictions at present about when this will happen.
China's chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said that  this could be completed by June  if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2  will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two .
According to a study by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said:  I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus because it's very easily transmitted will disappear completely  and that it could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year .
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of odor, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO says that about 1 in 6 people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult waking, and blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming infection, so the researchers made recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often five days.
Some information about how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is thought to be transmitted mainly through close contact and through fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can cause droplets to drop from a distance of 15 feet to 27 feet.
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected when speaking.
The pollen can land in the mouth or nose of others next to it or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore spread through the air.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some people fear that it may be transmitted through stool, this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms begin, however, it may be possible to spread before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms occurred suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few confirmed asymptomatic cases have been reported in the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected in some countries during contact research surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others.
The virus was detected three days later on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and four hours later on copper.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the UK authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, such as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease home.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thought to be zoonotic.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically related to the Betacoronavirus genus, the Sarbecovirus subgenus (lineage B) associated with two strains of bats.
It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and human viruses.
Comparison of the entire genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, final confirmation is by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RT) of infected secretions or scanning.
A study comparing PCR and the scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that the  scanner not be used to screen for or as a first-in-first-out test to diagnose COVID-19 .
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first appearance on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a sample of the rhinopharynx but a sample of the throat can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these products were proven reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral opacity in glass decolorated and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Because of the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is of limited accuracy for detecting COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scanners with PCR and showed that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its use as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neuron networks have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imaging on both X-rays and scanners.
Strategies for preventing the spread of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who have been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the outbreak.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been launched or proposed on a voluntary basis, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.False ideas are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organisations are currently working to develop one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after getting wet, coughing, or sneezing.
That's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended that alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol be used when soap and water are not readily available.
WORLD advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (within one minute of disinfectant exposure for a stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a daycare center, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their folded elbows or a handkerchief when they cough or sneeps, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the projected postmortem when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on where and when to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.
WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they are facing a significant risk, such as when they are caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it acknowledges that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their population to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical fabric masks.China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transportation or crowded areas.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make face masks at home and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without a mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of masks on everyone in public places, so that everyone can protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered everyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the use of masks on passengers on interurban trains and buses on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a mask mandatory for all outings, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask for those who cannot afford it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of disease by reducing contact between people.
The measures include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting one another without contact, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in the areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of gatherings recommended by the US government and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were thus invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. In late March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began replacing the term  social distancing  with  physical distancing , to clarify the  objective of reducing physical contact by maintaining social ties, whether or virtually keeping contact at a distance.
The use of the term social distancing meant that total social isolation was needed, rather than encouraging people to stay in touch with others through other means.
They include the recommendation that you have sex only with someone you live with, who has not the virus or has no symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in the affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the transmission is very high have been asked to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
The strategies for controlling an epidemic are to contain or suppress it and to mitigate it.
Lendiguement is being implemented during the early stages of the outbreak and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible to prevent, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow it down and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
Measures to combat and mitigate these risks may be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to inflate the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to reduce the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as closing schools and religious services; a public effort to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to control the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued travel warnings for infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who have quarantined themselves, and imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Simulations for the UK and the US show that mitigation (slowing but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (turning the epidemic back) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and healthcare systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression may be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), as otherwise transmission will bounce back quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term action to eradicate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing treatments.
Taking cold medications or drinking alcohol without a prescription and resting may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory support may be necessary.
Steroid use may worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO said that some  traditional and handmade remedies  can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO describes increasing the capacity and adaptation of healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response to the outbreak.
LECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for primary healthcare hospitals and services to redistribute resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent interventions wherever possible, separating and isolating patients tested positive for COVID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available fans and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei province in China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are usually linked to the wholesale market of seafood in Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have zoonotic origins. A foetus of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of an SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to start an investigation in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major railway hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted travel and put in place border controls.
National responses have included measures to contain such quarantine (also called stay-at-home, stay-at-home or lockdown orders) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of confinement, a figure that rose to 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests the first case was reported on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a case of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, which she reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of an SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have been warned about spreading rumors about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the largest quarantine in human history, a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built later: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government instituted new measures to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have introduced several measures, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transportation has been changed and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The report also highlights the importance of the role of the European Union in the fight against the spread of the virus in the global economy, which has been a major factor in the global spread of the virus.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international travellers entering the city.On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted within the country has been largely blocked, and that the outbreak has been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the lockdown began.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when this policy would end.
People who want to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and granted financial stimulus plans to businesses. The State Council of State Affairs announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10 a.m., which coincides with Qingming Day, although the central government has asked families to pay tribute online to respect physical distancing and avoid a renewal of the COVID-19 epidemic.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji worshippers who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of being the cause of the outbreak.
On February 22, 1,261 or about 13 percent of the 9,336 church members reported symptoms.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules have also been affected and therefore changed, and South Korea has introduced what was considered the world's largest and best-organized program to test the population for the virus, isolate all infected people and monitor and quarantine those who have come into contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by international newcomers via a mobile app, virus screening drives delivering results the next day, and an increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it did not quarantine entire cities.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be accused of mismanaging the epidemic by the government or praising his response.
On March 23, South Korea had the lowest daily case count in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was announced that from 1 April, all people arriving from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for assistance in testing for the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures announced by the government included cancelling concerts and other cultural events, sports and Friday prayers, and closing universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict interurban travel were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year has continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became a centre of spread of the virus after China in February.
In the context of allegations that the extent of the outbreak in Iran was concealed, more than 10 countries had identified the origin of their cases in Iran on 28 February, suggesting that the outbreak may have been more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government at that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, while 23 of its 290 members reported being tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all prisoners who meet certain conditions.

WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities had been accused of covering up efforts to prevent and contain it, and the current crisis, where the central government regularly reported on the panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO Representative Gauden Galea noted that although this was certainly not a WHO recommendation, it was a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated and he spoke of an unprecedented fact in the history of public health. On 30 January, following confirmation of an inter-human transmission outside China and an increase in cases in other countries, WHO declared that the epidemic was an international public health pandemic (IPP) since the US PPPI was declared a pandemic of public health in 2009.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that USPPI was due to the risk of global spread, particularly for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said:  there is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade  and  the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel .
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear.
Tedros then said that we were  as strong as our weakest link  and urged the international community to  invest today or pay more tomorrow . On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.

This virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared, adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid the worst.
Ryan then said that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that we accept absolutely that every human being on the planet is exposed to this virus.
On 11 March, WHO said the coronavirus outbreak could be described as a pandemic.
The Director-General indicated that WHO was extremely concerned about both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction. WHO faced significant criticism of its handling of the pandemic, which was deemed inadequate, in particular because of the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.

Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been removed from their posts following their quarantine management in central China, a sign of discontent with the response of policymakers to the epidemic in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some senior Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have rejected the initial idea that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has described the coronavirus as either Chinese virus or Wuhan virus, saying that in China censorship has overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic, which has since been labeled racism by some opponents and intended to divert attention from the administration's inability to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast has obtained a US government telegram exposing the broad lines of a communication ploy apparently coming from the National Security Council, whose strategy is quoted as follows:
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in every way possible, including at press conferences and on television. Press agencies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send aid to the countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda drive to gain global influence.
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "generous politics".
Borrell also said that  China aggressively insists that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner

On 22 March, following a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous senior political source as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was little or no use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of embarking on a charming geopolitical and diplomatic offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that by offering his assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to repay them if necessary.

President Hassan Rouhani of Iran wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has prompted calls for the United States to adopt common social policies with other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive" quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be accused of mismanaging the outbreak by the government or praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further notice, suspend parliament and elections and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's crisis management.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the outbreak, panic purchases and disruption of plant operations and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increasing consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also faced panic purchases which resulted in the disappearance of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, radiation, leading to shortages.
The technology sector in particular has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100.
This demand has led to prices rising up to 20 times the normal price and has also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and the WHO warns that this will put healthcare professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has given daigos a new opportunity to sell Australian products to China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that had been envisaged in Europe and North America.
The large agricultural output of Northern Italy did not see a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
The food supply was only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials unlocked pork supplies to provide sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store up reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy have been felt in China: according to a media report dated March 16, the Chinese economy was hit very hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a rise in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) described racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that the Chinese deserve the virus or receive a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese, both online and offline, and to the people in the affected areas.

The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which called them "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have been fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be eliminated.
Many paid access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific papers on the epidemic available to the public.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Anticorp detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate for the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported mortality rates, which may be considerably overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal discharge or expectoration.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing from pharyngeal swabs is only reliable during the first week of disease.
Afterwards, the virus can disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken into the deep airways by aspiration catheter, or a spit (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the  E  gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing their real-time PCR diagnostic device for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the RT International Resource Reintermediate Agency.
Among the earlier versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests yielded inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of testing at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were given permission to start screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced, and the collection and treatment of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervision Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be done in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing one device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S.A. from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 of these devices in the US, and Abbott plans to scale up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid (N-protein) protein of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
A bibliographic study from March 2020 concluded that  pulmonary X-rays have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of TMD [tomography] may be conclusive even before symptoms appear .
Typical symptoms seen in DMT include multi-lobal bilateral opacity in decolorated glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to TMD in Wuhan, where the current pandemic originated, suggested that TMD is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with several of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that  TMC not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19 .In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring. Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (CTL) or by point-of-care testing (POCT).
The automated broadband systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
For CTC, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
For PCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin injection.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that had duly informed the Agency and that can therefore now distribute their antibody testing.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after infection begins.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan whereby suspected cases can stay at home,  the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube , patients will spit inside, return it and later receive the test result.The British NHS has announced that it is running a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if they are not using it.
The  drive  centres have enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screening in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Physicians with Compulsory Health Insurance said on 2 March that it had the capacity to perform some 12 000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and that 10 700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch, President of the Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study found that in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested through the week 12/2020 included and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysing samples from 64 patients at a time, grouping the samples and testing only if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter improvised emergency detection laboratory called  Huo- (i.e.: 火眼, Yan  Eye of Fire) was opened in February 2020 by the French BGI and can treat more than 5,000 samples.
The modelling, which was carried out in 5 days under the supervision of Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan lab was quickly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 cities in total.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multiplex free models developed by Origami Assays have been released to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the UK and the US.
This has prompted some authors to review sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE was now testing most of its per capita population for Coronavirus, and was in the process of intensifying testing to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-scale broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first such capacity lab to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was only published on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits at the start of the outbreak, and these countries, as well as Australia, could not provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for screening by healthcare professionals.
However, experts say the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The capacity for screening, largely in private sector laboratories, has been enhanced over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying screening programmes as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has delayed hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the stocks of detergents and chemical reagents have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC developed test kits had  defects . The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic have provided false results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a high  error rate  and that it did not use them . The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and tracking of people who have been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two sets of tests on the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, approximately ten days apart.
Nearly half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement within the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracking, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on the scheduled holiday ending date of March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic by aggressively tracking contacts, restricting incoming travel, screening and quarantining, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and with limited experience of COVID-19 in their national laboratories send their first five positive and 10 negative samples of COVID-19 to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column  Positive in % of tests  depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to hospital will have a higher test positive percentage than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, with the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the practice of washing your hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain "key times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal route.
It is possible to get respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. your mucous membranes).
Washing hands with soap is important at five key times a day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's butt or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have water or soap in your hands, you can wash your hands with ashes.
before, during and after preparing meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing a baby's diaper or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after having coughed or sneezed;
after having touched an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
The Commission has also proposed a new approach to the reduction of infant mortality rates in home births.
According to a 2013 study, improved hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by nearly 50 percent.
The introduction of measures to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhea by about a third, comparable to the number of cases of water supply in low-income regions.
Hand washing with soap reduces diarrhea by 48 percent and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (AIRs).
Pneumonia, one of the leading causes of death among children under five years of age, is the leading cause of death for nearly 1.8 million children a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the practice of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the bathroom can save more lives than any other vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary measures under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor harmful effects, frequent hand washing can damage the skin causing dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or skin dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common in healthcare workers.
Too often washing hands is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Washing hands with soap at five key times of the day is important to reduce the transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (miction, defecation), after cleaning a baby's butt (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent disease transmission, including before and after treatment of a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or wetting, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand cleaning with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China had the lowest rate (23%) and there are now several methods to change behavior and democratize the use of handwashing soap at key times of the day. It is particularly possible in developing countries to offer schoolchildren to wash their hands at group times of the day so that children can make this a habit.
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a Primary Health Care Programme to promote the health and education of children.
Deparasitism twice a year, combined with daily handwashing with soap and daily toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soap or detergent should be added to the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are hardly soluble in water.
However, adequate water flow makes it easier to clean.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that  liquid soap vending machines are preferable 
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended for people who care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in the wild.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin-protective and stress-relieving agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the School of Public Health at the University of Oregon found that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for individuals and containing triclosan in preventing disease and eliminating hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in eliminating natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic water-based hand hygiene products (commonly called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for the hands or hand disinfectants) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickener such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to produce a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to produce a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4-5 logs) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to moisten or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the fingers and toenails should be faced for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not strengthened by skin emollients and/or moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/ or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, emollient-containing hydroalcoholic solutions caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dermatitis or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizers for non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Among low-income people, many do not have the means to buy soap, and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less soap.
Furthermore, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than curb them.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, when in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands properly to prevent disease transmission by following the following steps:
Wet your hands with running water, whether warm or cold.
Current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Splash a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse in plenty of running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can result in re-contamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.
Wet and wet hands are more likely to re-contaminate. The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
A moisturizer lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives to hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, running water from a suspended and pierced bucket or drain and/or using ash if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a cotton swab suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is debated.
Increasing research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper-wrapping industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the hygiene levels offered by more modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air-jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194 percent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 percent on the palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42%, and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms. Scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the apparatus at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the apparatus and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer allows the spread of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In a 2005 study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand drying has been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant towels is an alternative solution when travelling, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing became a medical requirement long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in preventing illness in hospital settings (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that using them reduced the rate of infection.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to mould and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a hair brush may be used to remove them.
Since germs in water can stay on your hands, it is important to rinse and wipe them well with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents further contamination of the hands when contacting surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the number of catheter-related blood infections by 66 percent.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines drawn up by the Organization can also be consulted on the website for comments from users.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance with the regulations is demonstrated.
The World Health Organization defines five indications for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (medicinal or antimicrobial soaps) gives the hand washer a germ-killing action.
It is desirable to remove these germs before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are widespread. To 'squeeze' hands for surgery, a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching with the hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine washing product, sterile hand towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile tool to clean the nails are required.
All jewelry must be removed.
In this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
After washing hands, dry hands should be done with sterile laundry and a surgical coat worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after dealing with a sick person.
In the case of the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there was very little additional benefit to increasing hand washing frequency by more than 35%.
Compared to regular hand washing with soap and antibacterial soap, the rate of foodborne bacterial infections is more than three times higher; similarly, comparing hand washing with an alcohol solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the latter.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing the influenza A (H1N1) virus and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. To improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible to train staff on hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to them, and to provide written and verbal reminders about this.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an inexpensive and essential tool for maintaining health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap, and hand washing facilities at home, at school, and at work makes it difficult to establish universal practices for hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, hand washing taps are rare to find near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building hand washing stations.
However, low rates of handwashing can also be attributed to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting hand washing with soap and raising awareness of it can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of soap and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
To achieve this, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, and social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting handwashing in schools, UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to encourage behavioural change. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy living earned (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for vulnerable people such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing in Britain.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by fetid odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and hospital-acquired infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a key means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating good hand washing techniques were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression 'to wash one' refers to a person's refusal to accept responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It comes from a Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has become widespread in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience in regard to the crimes she committed and that she incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and place more value on hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of purification, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which involves using water rather than soap to wash hands, is part of hand washing rituals promoted in many religions, including Bahá'í and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual hand washing (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, washing in the washing machine in Christianity and wudhu in Islam.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is compulsory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after every meal.
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace
COVID-19 workplace risk controls are the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control to prevent the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on an assessment of the risks from exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing labelling and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Employment at medium exposure risk includes those requiring frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high population density work environments and certain high volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of encounters with someone with COVID-19.
LOSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, and is at very high risk if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or sampling or manipulation of samples of people with suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for such workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to care for others or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both in terms of goods demanded and in terms of the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted.A plan for preparation and response to infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, family and community risk factors and individual risk factors for workers such as old age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the controls necessary to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms a framework used globally in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on workers' behaviour.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing labels, including covering their mouths and noses for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage bags, preparing for remote work or scheduled working hours as needed, dissuading workers from using other people's tools and equipment and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever controllers or other symptoms-reactive medications. They also recommend that flexible sick leave policies be applied, that employees stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be informed of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m), with people who are not suspected or known to have COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently travelled internationally to a region with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail environments.Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly efficient air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and installation of a drive-in window for customer service.Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, conducting in-person meetings via virtual communications, setting up a high-level social protection network, providing non-essential travel equipment to meet the risk of COVID-19 exposure, providing personal protective equipment to workers, including the use of personal protective equipment, and providing a means of protecting workers from COVID-19 and other workplace hazards, and providing a means of protecting workers from the spread of COVID-19 and other workplace hazards, including the use of social protection and protecting workers from the spread of COVID-19 and other factors that may affect the safety of workers, including the use of social media, and the use of social media, and the use of social media.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to wear respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following: separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a protective mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when they cough or sneeze.
Cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching organic fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include postponing travel in case of illness and self-isolation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if a person develops a fever or other symptoms once on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring should take place in the isolationist's cabin.For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has entered a school building, regardless of the community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate Community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir lessons or canteen meals, increasing the space between offices, scheduling arrival and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of a major transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered.For law enforcement officers carrying out routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to come into contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using a household detergent towel or spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
LOSHA considers certain health and funeral workers to be in categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or sampling or manipulation of samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough-induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs with high risk of exposure include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they are at very high risk of exposure if they are autopsied.Additional technical controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain sanitary and funeral settings.
Samples shall be handled using Level 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on suspected COVID-19. In addition to other PPIs, OSHA recommends breathing masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respiratory filtration masks or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide greater protection and comfort for workers. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a fluid-borne disease.
WHO recommends the wearing of a surgical mask only by screening staff at the entry point.
WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses or facial screens, a blouse and gloves for those who collect breathing samples, care for or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol procedures.
In the case of aerosol-producing procedures, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Given the insufficient global supply of EPPI, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a premises occupied by a COVID-19 patient to those directly involved in his/her care, using only the EPPs needed for the specific task, continuing to use the same breathing mask without removal for the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of EPPs, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJECTIVE: [Covid-19] Lightening the burden and preparing for the future
Date and time: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We're in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the kind of global empathy, cooperation and community strengthening that is at the heart of this organisation.
The camaraderie and kindness we've seen among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings we've been lucky enough to work with.
I cannot be more grateful and proud of you all as my colleagues.
Last week, someone thanked me for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol that this essential resource represents is that it remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible because of your work, whether you maintain the sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments in work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation we considered what we thought would be the appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organisation during this period.
Our primary concern was to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, contractors and contractors:
Our daily working time target will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful in the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we do.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please notify Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department so that T&amp;C can help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary management attention).
The hourly staff will be paid in full.
We have already announced this and reaffirm our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our contractors and our fellow hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we're here to help.
Many people use work as a way to relieve their stresses about the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to protect you.
We simply ask that you contact your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things we need to keep doing.
The SRE, Ops RH, Confiance &amp; Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are carrying out essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the fundamental tasks of our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to work twice as hard to catch up with the time lost when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and we will endeavour to set new objectives and timetables where appropriate.
What about the annual planning programme?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to budget so that employees can focus on essential work, taking care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines greatly reduces the workload and the pressure of current planning throughout the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office location, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of extreme caution, we have called on an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of our San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all the surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and the elevator cages leading up to our floor.
The building uses its own duty of care protocol which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork location, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington DC staff.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's guidance.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to working remotely know that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to give you some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them over several days.
Set the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Making videos the norm, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the Slack channel #remoties to talk to your work distribution colleagues
The HR team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increased distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or changed.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness over the upheaval and relief from the clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communication with them.
Staying in touch despite the COVID-19 issues
We'll send an invitation on your calendar for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll take this opportunity to share more updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns all of us and we're here to help you in any way we can.
Until then, you can still find the information in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all the information in one place.
We also endeavour to maintain regular communication with staff members living in countries currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a large workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, please contact the CRT.
We're here to support you and to ensure liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global Human Resources International.
None of these changes should be considered as a departure from our work and obligations.
It is a matter of acknowledging that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we feel are necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to give our movement the help it needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can count.
Our planned work will be here waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will take place in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need each of you to be able to do this, so that you can provide for yourself and your families so that you can give the best of your own time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and do not touch your face.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the marketing of certain dangerous goods.
bLangiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme bound to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
LACE2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of dangiotensin II and increasing the angular frequency (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. LACE2 is also the entry point for some coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Langiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminated renal amino acid transporter colectin domain.
LACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, whose enzymatically active domain is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
LACE2 is present in most organs: lACE2 is connected to the cell membrane mainly by type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle blood cells in most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate for the ACE.
LACE divides the angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
LACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxylic amino acid phenylamine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
LACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, lapelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
LACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, binding of SARS-CoV spike protein S1 and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of lACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both virus and lenzyme into the endosomes inside cells.
This entry process also requires the transformation of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 serine host protease, which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs should continue.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that  use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects. 
In addition,  the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those suffering from stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for overall pneumonia risk.
Human recombinant angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is presumed to be an innovative treatment for severe lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people with intolerance to conventional renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases with high circulation of dangiotensin II.
COVID-19 apps are mobile apps designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying people ( contacts ) who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on tracing the geographical location of app users, raise questions about privacy.
Other less intrusive options exist, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications into their Android and iOS operating systems.
The Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to verify if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, while Singapore has opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been provided as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched StopKorona! , a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia wants to introduce a georepairing application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and living in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, has discussed several possible practical problems with the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple only allows official or generally trusted organisations to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, particularly the possible dismantling of surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limiting this type of surveillance.
These organisations have set out eight conditions for government projects:
the monitoring should be legal, necessary and proportionate;
Extensions of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of the fight against COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrated in a way that is demonstrable;
Digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
protection against abuse and remedies for citizens should be provided for in the event of abuse;
 significant participation  of all  relevant stakeholders  would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present important potential privacy concerns.
However, not all central server systems need to access personal location data; several systems have been designed to use central servers for intercommunication only, which allows for privacy (see next section).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application has been used for tracing contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, which they then linked together to send SMS alerts to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following profound changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites.Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems to protect privacy.
Details were not yet disclosed on 6 April 2020.
Privacy tracing is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as early as 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all correspondence is made on the device.
The MIT Media Lab's Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white paper  Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic  published in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma's SafeTrace MPC platform, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising their privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the International Coalition was established by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their wide adoption by a wide audience.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would protect privacy and would combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-enhancing cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-respecting coronavirus tracking apps
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment, which is intended to help the Member States to ensure that the protection of the environment is not restricted to the use of the Internet, is also supported by the Commission.
Repositioning a medicinal product (also called reorientation, re-routing, re-assignment or change of therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) refers to the reconversion of an approved medicinal product for a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a scientific research area currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion from people recovering. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these link sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include papain-type protease, RNA-dependent polymerase lRNA, lhelicase, S protein and lADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds which they then optimized and analysed to determine their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of dhydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that the use, dosage or duration of lhydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection has not yet been established.
Doctors have recommended using this medicine when there is no other option.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Further studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen confirmed that favipiravir was clearly effective.
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received lumifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the drug is thin and preliminary.

According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already spread.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to have children.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that no benefit was observed.
These drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by the Cleveland University Hospitals; one in people with moderate pathology and the other in those with more severe forms.
There are three clinical trials currently underway on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin's lalvesco (ciclésonide), an inhaled corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A phase II trial is underway with 200 patients recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruited 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and had moderate symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or those who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several blood thinners are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients studying the use of sodium linoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifénovir: Lumifénovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repository for COVID-19 treatment:
tocilizumab (IL-6-anti-receptor): approved by the Chinese government.
Tests are also underway in Italy and China.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many attempts at development are underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, until at least 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing a Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak was reported worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investment and research into developing a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the ECI initiative for developing a vaccine, which were defined in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were leading research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets for Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (vaccine developer and candidate phase I: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (vaccine developer and candidate phase I: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As stated by the ECCI scientists in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) have been confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or design).
A phase I-II trial carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, placebo controlled and performed in multiple centres, with more precise effective doses determined.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular-clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in an accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle thanks to partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing laboratory research, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac  large sums of money to get exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine , prompting a protest from the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech for the joint development of a vaccine based on mRNA.
The candidate dARNm vaccine BNT162 is currently in preclinical testing phase with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
The other investment partners of the ECIEC for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the sequence being sent by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 medical countermeasures research projects, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national vaccine bank containing several new vaccines that can be used if further coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that micro-needle-administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits triggered a significant response to specific antibody antibodies of [mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities joined forces to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia involves 4 170 healthcare professionals.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as ACE-2 genetically modified mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates the need for implementation of Level 3 biosegurity containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protection vaccine for SARS that has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies worldwide.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were underway; all vaccines were viral, two adeno-viral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-MERS-S.
Social media posts have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
While most cases produce mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is spread mainly through close contact, often through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Since these droplets are produced at expiry, they usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than being an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during the later stages of the disease.
Masks are recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the general public vary, with some authorities advising against their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and blue face or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under study.The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; out of 166 infections reported today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both expectoration and saliva can carry important viral loads.
Speaking out loud frees up more droplets than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that a cough without protection can throw droplets from a distance of 15 feet [4.5 meters].
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and that air collectors located in the corridor outside patients' rooms produced viral RNA positive samples.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause airborne spread.
Although there are concerns about spreading through stool, this risk is seen as low.The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although it may be possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others.
The virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products break down the protective lipid layer of the virus, disabling it and eliminating the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease case home.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronavirus in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus reaches the host cells via the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called  spicule  (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12 percent of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be linked to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis.Optoses of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the epithelial cells of the airways that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
It is in particular GM-CSF secretory T cells that have been associated with the recruitment of lIL6 secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or dexpectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however they require two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and release the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experiment revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test nearest to the patient on March 21, 2020 for use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-local bilateral opacity in glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms seen at the beginning of infection.
Pleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with progression of the disease.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
There are four types of severity of viral pneumonia:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytary hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
ADD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) and severe hypoxemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leukopharyngeal reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a sleeve when you cough or sneeze and using the inside of your elbow when there is no sleeve.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC has recommended that people cover their faces with a cloth in public places to limit transmission in asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact between infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling important gatherings.
The distance guidelines also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no known effective vaccine in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element in managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also known as flattening the curve.
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after getting wet, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not an active antiseptic substance for the hands.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care which may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
External membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene, lifestyle and healthy eating have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments can be helpful for those with moderate symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Resuscitation doctors and pneumologists in the United States have compiled therapeutic recommendations from several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In terms of symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen as the frontline.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in care conditions where the performance of procedures may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals treating people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorised the use of these masks under an emergency use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unindicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends facial protection screens or, as a last resort, handmade masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are severe.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be prevented by using a high-speed nasal duct or positive pressure from the double-level airway.
It is not known whether either or both of these benefits are the same for people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the capacity of the healthcare system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimise oxygen delivery and minimise the risk of ventilation-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
Research into potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs under test are already approved in other indications and testing is already in progress.
An antiviral medicinal product may be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary approval for plasma from people recovering as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The application is able to detect close contacts using monitoring data and therefore to detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health authorities.Mass data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency, to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not meet quarantine.
In Italy, the regional health minister, Giulio Gallera, said he had been informed by mobile operators that  40% of people continue to move .
The German government has conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global appeal to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying,  Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail for damaging people's mental health and wellbeing 
The disease may progress moderately with few or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as colds.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection from data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data on COVID-19 is lacking. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiviscereal failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, blood clotting disorders, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Blood clotting disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6 percent of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with kidney failure in 4 percent of those in this group.
About 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care showed an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent, while the mortality rate for women was 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopath changes have been observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to data from March from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing diseases.The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate from the disease vary due to these regional differences but also due to methodological difficulties.
Undercounting moderate cases may lead to an overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong hospital administration has observed a 20 to 30 percent drop in respiratory capacity in some people who have recovered from the disease, and lung scanners suggest organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and animal-based, through the spread of infection.
The true origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the CIM-10 Emergency Pathological Codes U07.1 for laboratory confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio was 6.9 percent (153,822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who die from the disease and the infectious mortality rate (IRF) which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population of infection after the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19-related deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004 percent of the population) were confirmed as COVID-19-related.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate differ between men and women.
The mortality rate in humans is higher in studies carried out in China and Italy.
The risk is highest in men in their 50s, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors may be among them.
The differences in immunology between sexes, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development of co-morbidities such as hypertension in men at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not collect data related to the gender of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be  COVID-19 .
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus and D stands for disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses  COVID-19 virus  and  virus responsible for COVID-19  in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly called  coronavirus .
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called  coronavirus  and  Wuhan coronavirus .
In January 2020, WHO recommended that the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV be used for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of place names in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the limitations of the capacity of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as washers and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 valves needed in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is currently being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY trial to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the lACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, the researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to provoke a rapid immune response in the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spiculed S protein that helps the virus to infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Anticorps-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated already approved malaria treatments, including four studies on lhydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-converting antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries expected to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and lhydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in association with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest that remdesivir will be effective in March 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some call for an independent analysis of the research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of 1 gram, indicates that doubling this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of lhydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or lumifénovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initially spiculated protein that is initiated using serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE receptor 2.
Studies on chloroquine and lhydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies.
Cytokine shock can be a complication in later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that lhydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-stroke-fighting properties.Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was conducted.
He is currently undergoing a nationally non-randomized phase 2 trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected to be causing the death of some affected individuals.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of a different-cause steroid-refractory cytokine re-expanding syndrome, CAR T cell treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CFS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from people recovering, which is the liquid part of the blood of healed patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
