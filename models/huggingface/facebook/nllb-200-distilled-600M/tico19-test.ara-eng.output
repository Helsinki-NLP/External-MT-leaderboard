Rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that although the stage varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative factor is the novel coronavirus now referred to as the SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that about 80% of individuals infected with COVID-19 have a mild illness; that is, they have respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
In about 14%, COVID-19 infection worsened to a more severe hospital-dwelling illness, while the remaining 6% had a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The death rate of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA/UK country and compare them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After what happened in China, COVID-19 spread increasingly geographically and the dynamics of COVID-19 famine in the rest of the world are now being tracked by the dynamics of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the EuroSurvelins issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri and others reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases as defined by the World Health Organization.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 for people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, as between 31 December 2019 to this date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country around the world is being updated daily at 8:00 a.m., only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health in countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization.
This data was used to assess and compare COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK with those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases that occurred intermittently over 14 days, then observed the normal course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of reported cases from each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m., with comparison to the number in Italy during the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases reported over a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February, then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (substance).
This was often driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increases in cumulative COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK reported the total number of cases already similar to those in Italy just 3 weeks or less ago.
Our results suggest that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The notable trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, despite the different national public health responses, and the possibility of different country status definitions and protocols for choosing patients to be tested to confirm their COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas in Italy described the situation where about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on hospitalization and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not available).
However, it must be collected in a systematic manner to supplement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a great diversity in the availability of intensive care and mediocre care families in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 families per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and average care per 100,000 people in 201011).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK for the prevalence of COVID-19 cases that have entered hospitals at risk of 90% to exceed the ICU family capacity, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since cases have so far been collected in certain areas in the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional populations, information on cases and intensive care families is preferred at the level of the regional unit designation for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
So countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the scenario of sustainable community transition to SARS-CoV-2 and an increasing number of COVID-19 patients who need health care, especially intensive care, like what's happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As shown in the Rapid Risk Assessment of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the comprehensive proactive Rapid Approach is key to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as the shift from containment to mitigation approaches, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented beforehand.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity for countries to step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, healthcare systems in the EU/other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients requiring focused care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and injured more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2 can, like its similar SARS-CoV virus, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, also spread from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and affecting among older people than among young people and among men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We'll discuss the basics of the disease's epidemic, its causes, its virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help us understand and eliminate the disease that is a threat.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors for the entire holiday period and for many weeks afterwards due to a new viral outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (Cov) that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease associated with it is called Cov-19 disease (Covid-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has led to 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is the public enemy number one and could be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research on COVID-19 has been published, including the epidemiology of the disease, its causes, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report was released on January 7, 2020, which identified the sequencing of the isolated virus in many patients.
This review aims to summarize the research progress in the new and rapidly developing field.
Wherever possible, we'll try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by Cove, which is MERS, a 2012 outbreak.
We'll also discuss what we've learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some pressing questions that remain.
Coronaviruses were usually considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, and they primarily caused about 15% of the four common colds.
However, in this century, we have faced two serious human diseases caused by coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease quickly spread to many other countries at a terrible rate of spread and death.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups with unidentified pneumonia originating in Wuhan were first reported to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first case of death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, counties and countries.
On January 20, cases of infection were reported among healthcare providers, suggesting the possibility of transmission from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed with all public transportation shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that out of 41 confirmed cases of infection, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which considered the site of infection to be from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2) [2].
With the situation developing rapidly, the final extent of the outbreak and its seriousness still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more up-to-date explanation of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but it primarily affects people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half of those infected (47.7%) were over 50, and very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 affects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread between groups in and around Hobby primarily.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of infection to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time of injury from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base reproduction number (base reproduction number) was 3.77 (confidence range is 95%: 3.51-4.05) and the base reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases is rising exponentially before 23 January 2020, in line with the heavy travel operations ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed cases was 1.44% (confidence range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%) and the corrected mortality rate per patient was 3.06% (confidence range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a class of large, encased viruses that contain a single-stranded, trend-positive riboside DNA.
They can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and it's known that alpha and beta viruses infect humans.
The S-containing sugar protein is linked to its cellular receptors, the angioutensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the beta-deyl peptidase 4 (DBP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral riboside DNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is replicated, the genome riboside DNA, accompanied by the glucose membrane proteins and the nucleic cage proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity that exceeds 99.98% among 10 sequence-checked samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Wuhan Seafood Market.
SARS-CoV-2 is more like a SARS-CoV gene than a Mercer-CoV.
Electronic microscopy of the transmission revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airflow.
It was revealed that the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 with a weaker binding than SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less acute infection in patients than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make a short-chain protein encoded by orf3b and a protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and limit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional scale or pattern.
On February 18, 2020, Chu and others reported the full-length structure of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 under the supercooled electron microscope with a 2.9 Å resolution within a compound with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, could have accumulated to form a demer and that ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to S protein, providing evidence for identification of coronavirus and infection.
A sodium-based neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host.
It's been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through cats, respectively, the cat lizard and the camel.
By comparing the sequential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2, where the new virus matches 96% of SARS-like coronaviruses from bats and is called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the mediator host that helped the virus cross the strain barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and has not yet clarified the path of transmission.
J. and others suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous reassembly within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that ant scavengers - long-tongued ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the likely mediator host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic similarity to the coronavirus detected in ant scavengers and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across two genomes is still significant; therefore, we expect conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the lab for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol with a concentration of 75%, chlorine-containing purifiers, asphyxiant peroxide, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhoxide, could effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to get the novel virus.
Currently, there has been no detailed study of the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.
So, we can only go back to previous studies on other coronaviruses, specifically SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Figure 4)
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is recognized by the natural immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including ketine-like C-type receptors, tol-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding splice-scale receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLs).
Through different pathways, the virus triggers the appearance of inflammatory factors, branched cell maturation, and the formation of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate large lymphocytes to viral antibodies.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV-2 can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response soon joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate pro-virus cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
T cells produce inflammatory activated cytokines to help immune cells.
However, the coronavirus can limit T cell function by inducing programmed T cell death.
Mixed immunity, including protein-containing proteins such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential in fighting viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies neutralized a recovering MERS-CoV patient.
On the other hand, an over-reaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and worst of all, multiple organ function failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function has been compromised to have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or usually between 3 and 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average childcare period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as shown above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the timing of the effective stones based on the most accurate custody period, and thus prevent people who are infected but do not have symptoms from passing the virus on to others.
As a common practice, people infected with the virus are usually asked to undergo a 14-day hygiene.
Should the period of the stones be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, and it may not be accompanied by any symptoms or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal swelling, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have difficulty breathing and/or lack of blood oxygenation within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patients' condition developed rapidly to have acute respiratory syndrome, auto-impaired, metabolic acids, and atrial fibrillation.
Patients with fever or severe respiratory and fever symptoms should be screened, even without receiving a pulmonary malfunction imaging, in search of the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for diarrhea, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that had been infected by someone who had no symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them need much more respiratory support than COVID-19 patients and have been in line with the higher mortality rate for MERS from COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) have also been observed in patients with ME.
In SARS patients, it turned out that both fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and that respiratory support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2% while the confirmed cases worldwide were 66,576.
In comparison, the SARS death rate by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Merce, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that the baseline reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CA) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the baseline reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 ranged between only 2 and 4.
A comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and baseline reproductive numbers is shown in Table Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than Mercer-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.
So, it's much harder to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than it is to control the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of disease in the clusters often occurs in the family itself, or from the same cluster or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of mixing people or patients during the last two weeks before the disease begins.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending a warning to increase the time of the stones.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymph nodes) in the early stages.
For example, a lack of lymphomas with 4×109/liter white blood cells including 1×109/liter lymphomas, and high levels of aspartate amine transporter and blood transfusion were detected in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients increased, the C-reactive protein increased and the rate of red blood cell clotting in most patients increased.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of D-demer, which is caused by the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, increases and the number of lymph cells gradually decreases.
The radiographic disorders appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-spotted shadows or a glass casing in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have abnormal pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, out-of-control inflammation, fluid buildup, and elevated cough greatly affect gas exchange.
Lung malfunction of type 1 and type 2 cells reduces the level of surface activation and increases surface tension, thus, reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
So, the worst chest x-ray results are often compared to the greatest severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the shrinkage of lung cells, the formation of the hyaline membrane, cellular lymphatic drainage, and numerous nucleic stem cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome and is similar to what happens to SARS and MERS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 riboside DNA through a polymerase chain reaction of the BT-PCR has been used as a key standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative outcome rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which are no longer individually based on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation happened in the SARS diagnosis.
So a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiographic discoveries is essential and essential to an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol to use the Crisper-based Sherlock technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects fragments of SARS-CoV-2's created riboside DNA at a rate of 20×10-18 moles/liter to 200×10-18 moles/liter (10-100 copies per micrometer of input) using a submersion in less than an hour without the need for precise hardware.
We hope that the new technology can improve sensitivity and fitness significantly if tested in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can provide mainly supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed in the past to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immuno-capsules, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Plasma from recovering patients has even been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and antiviral vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also, to a lesser extent, attack other organs that release the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, such as the digestive system, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and malfunction are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-inflammatory respiratory systems, and artificial respiratory systems that are inflammatory depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMOH), a metaphorical cardiopulmonary technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and auto-impact, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It's known that the cytokine storm causes an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunodeficiency is essential in treating cytokine storms, especially in acute patients.
Activated hormones, tcelisomab, and a monogenetic antibody, the anti-interleukin 6, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other treatments for cytokine storm immunodeficiency inhibitors include modifying the T cell-directed immune response; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF block; genus kinase inhibitor; planatomumab; cytokine signal inhibitor 4; and histone desitylis inhibitors.
Antibiotics and immuno-capsules have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, the higher-dose steroids were not helpful with severe lung infection in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially vascular degeneration, which severely affects the prognosis of the disease.
However, it has been recommended to use short cycles of activated hormones in small to medium doses with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiviral treatment has been confirmed to be effective.
However, it was found that administering Remdesivir, a nucleotide counterpart, to a venom was effective with an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral developed by Gilead initially to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed a potential inhibitor of other viruses with a single-chain riboside nucleotide, including the MERS virus and SARS.
Based on these viruses, Gilead has submitted the compound to China for some trials on SARS-CoV-2 individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, parisetin, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/retonavir, and ribavirin are proposed as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with blufenavir/retonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and antibody generation .
Blood collection from patients recovering from a disease is a long-standing practice for treating other patients with the same disease or for preventing healthy individuals from contracting the disease.
Indeed, recovering patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are anti-agglobulin (AG) produced by peripheral lymphatic cells to fight off pathogens and other foreign bodies, which recognize and neutralize the unique molecules in pathogens directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation, viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are essential to present this method for wide use before specific treatments are reached.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can trigger an immune response by over-stimulating and trigger the release of cytokines, which are potentially life-threatening toxins.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating patients with critical conditions.
It's hard to develop specific antibodies and produce them fast enough to fight a global pandemic.
So isolating the e. coli from recovered patients and identifying the genetic code that encodes the active antibodies, or screening for the active antibodies against the virus's core proteins, is more decisive and practical.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are highly dependent on a set of multiple components in a composition that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or obscure as they are difficult to extract and verify from these ingredients or their optimal compositions.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Shu Feng Ji-do and Lian Hua King Wen capsules has been discovered for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China where traditional Chinese medicine was used in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and severity of their condition should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Chang and his work partners published a study comparing Western medicine treatment alone (WM) to the combination therapy between Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the time it took to recover from high body temperature, symptoms, and hospital stay was much shorter in the Western + Traditional Chinese treatment group than in the Western treatment group alone.
Most impressively, the symptom exacerbation rate (ranging from mild to severe) was much lower in the Western + Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine alone treatment group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western + Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine alone treatment group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine are still pending further well-studied experiments on a larger scale and at more centers.
It would also be interesting to describe the mechanism of the procedures and to explain the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected of or confirmed of COVID-19 often feel very afraid of a highly contagious disease and even fatal, and people who are on the hygiene routine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, infection symptoms such as fever, dehydration, cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as sleepiness caused by active hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorders.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor neuron thrombosis, psychotic symptoms, dizziness, and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Tracking the mixture and the mandatory sanity stone, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more worried and guilty about the effects of infection, sanity stone, and staining their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people who are affected by it, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include establishing multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication points with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and plans to treat it, and using specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct interference with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut the chain of transmission of the virus from infected animal and human stockpiles to infected hosts are necessary and often complement antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
The live vaccine was evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these filtered vaccines in the living body in elderly and lethal challenge models and in preventing them from becoming infected with an animal-borne virus before a clinical study began has not been determined.
It's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, cases and scattered groups of MERS continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions because of the continued presence of animal resources in the affected areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS were developed using inactive viruses, deoxygenated riboside DNA plasmids, viral transporters, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of the protein compound, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the challenge is challenging because of the length of time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a new disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without treatment.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also linked to high rates of disease spread and deaths in severe cases.
So building a model of disease outlook is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of disease in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the outcome of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
The age groups of 30 to 65 were mainly affected by COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed focused care were more likely to develop underlying diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not (average age 66 to 51), indicating age as a predictor of COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as shown above.
Complicated diseases: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart disease and irregular heartbeat.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to positive bile cells with the angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and disease are strongly linked and may interfere.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of the C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictor of disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The link between the level of C-reactive protein and the severity of COVID-19 and its prognosis was also uncovered.
In addition, elevated enzyme-containing hydrogen lactate (LDH), aspartate amine transporter (AST), alanine amine transporter (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So, they're traditional signs of functional disorders in the heart or liver.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and progression of clinical symptoms must be considered alongside other problems to predict the outcomes of COVID-19 and its complications.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the widespread use of high doses of activated hormones in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered vascular degeneration with a life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, the drugs should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As noted above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered extraordinary stress; they often endured prolonged periods of mental illness, severe uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to reproducing in the lower respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reproduce in the upper respiratory system and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common cold sores.
So, patients infected in the early stages or the nursery can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, making it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was considered to occur when patients were in a very satisfactory state, while most transmission of the virus did not occur in the early stages.
So, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
Intensive efforts are currently being made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous sanitation for almost all residents in the hope of preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures have caused a lot of damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the decline will continue for three to four months.
However, some other experts don't have the same degree of optimism.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have created a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-neck and throat surveys of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a periodic outbreak similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, which suggests that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to a million cases and half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
It could, like SARS-CoV-2, become weaker in infection and eventually disappear or become a virus that is less pathogenic to humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with virus-contaminated substances.
The virus was also found in the stool, which creates a new possibility of passing from the stool to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, great precautions need to be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passersby who have had contact with patients or infected people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series number 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from passing through the air or sticking to the surface of the material, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860s) can protect from small viruses inhalation as much as 10 to 80 nanometers, with only 5% of viruses able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size and is approximately 85 nanometers each.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks stacked together, the infected healthcare providers must directly wear N95 masks (series number 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers must wear appropriate insulation shells to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face masks or glasses when working with patients.
For the general population in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more clean soap than usual, try to stay home for self-cleaning and minimize contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered a good distance to keep people away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and also prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its strong resemblance to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 would have caused a state of extreme alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control did not reassure citizens until 19 January 2020 that the novel virus had a low infection rate and limited human-to-human propagation and that there was no problem preventing and containing the disease.
This message greatly diminished the public's alertness, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and it was a critical time to keep the disease at a minimum in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may benefit from this harsh lesson and make substantial improvements in the future.
For example, such agencies should be (1) more cautious when releasing public data because every word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive in containing a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; (4) more effective and targeted training to increase public awareness of epidemics and periodically test and improve the community response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar to COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a sense of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher in older adults than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients carry the virus even when they have no symptoms, whereas SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and much wider than SARS-CoV.
A normal SARS-CoV-2 DNA test may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who recover from the virus can get infected again.
These findings greatly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With this rapid progress in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be solved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What kind of animal was the medium species that transmitted the virus from its original host, like bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can't effectively stop the transition, and the outbreak could return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause satisfactory subsequent changes?
Does the virus also bind to the secreted angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick, accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it passes through humans?
Will it become a global famine, or will it vanish like SARS, or will it recur periodically like the flu?
It is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above questions and many others.
However, at whatever cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as quickly as possible and restore our lives to their normalcy.
Animal origin of the human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation has driven the joint evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human coronaviruses cause mild illness, such as a cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS has caused the other side to show how serious and life-threatening human coronavirus infections can be.
SARS-CoV-2's emergence in central China at the end of 2019 brought a new focus on coronavirus, and we were surprised by how quickly it spread but with the potential to cause disease compared to its SARS-CoV sibling.
The human coronavirus is an animal disease, so understanding the animal origins of human coronaviruses would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
They have also been known to host intermediate storage for some human coronaviruses.
Identifying host animals has a direct effect on preventing human disease.
Investigating interactions between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides an important insight into the origin of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the date of their discovery as well as their animal origins and species-to-species transmission.
What's important is that we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the reassembly of the genome.
In this context, the disease caused by the current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements for successful host switching and the impact of complications of virus development on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of viruses coated with a single-stranded, trend-positive ribose nucleic acid.
These viruses have the largest genome among riboside DNA viruses, with a 26 to 32 kg base, and are called "crown viruses" because their structure resembles a crown under an electronic microscope.
In terms of their compositional properties, coronaviruses have undifferentiated genomes that share similar regulation.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome contains large overlapping open reading pairs (ORF1a and ORF1b), which convert into the multi-copy protein types pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike S, E, M, and N.
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from specific strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (coronavirus alpha, coronaviruses beta, coronaviruses gamma, coronaviruses delta), among which are the types of coronaviruses beta that comprise most human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, W, and W).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic origin of most coronaviruses alpha and corona beta, while birds are the main repository of corona gamma and corona delta viruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently overcome species barriers and have emerged as the cause of serious human diseases.
Seven human coronaviruses are known so far.
These include human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-NL63 which belong to the coronaviruses alpha.
The other five beta coronaviruses include human coronaviruses-OC43, human coronaviruses-HKU1, SARS-CoV-2-associated coronaviruses, MERS-CoV-2-associated coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds, diarrhea or both.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory syndrome (ASS) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
It was isolated from human coronavirus-229E, genus I B814, from the nasal secretions of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Much information has since been gathered through intensive studies of human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-OC43, which automatically cure their symptoms.
In fact, it was a commonly held concept that human coronavirus infection was harmless until SARS.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is among the deadliest epidemics in our modern history, with 8,000 people injured and approximately 10% dead.
Ten years later, the updated MERS-CoV has spread into the Arabian Peninsula as a stable epidemic with spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (RHV-2019), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and injured more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses are from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Animal tracing of human coronaviruses has shown a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and restrictive factors for species-to-species mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the warehouse, intermediate host and the enlarged host animal (enlarged host animal) of SARS-CoV-2, with significant effects to prevent future repercussions.
In this review, we give an overview of animal origins, species-to-species transitions, and the causes of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we'll shed light on and discuss the common belief that the original viruses of human coronaviruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural host warehouses but become pathogenic after they've been transferred between species to a new host.
We also review the trajectory of the human coronavirus, where an increase in its transmission capacity often comes with a decrease in the severity of the disease.
We also discuss in this context the outcomes of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of human coronavirus-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretions of cold patients, various types of coronaviruses were isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the chronological history of the discovery of the human coronavirus (Table 1) will be educational and informative.
The first strain of human coronavirus-229E was isolated from the respiratory system of upper respiratory tract infection patients in 1966, and then adapted to live in the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with human corona virus-229E experience common cold symptoms, including headache, cough, nausea, throat inflammation, fever, and cough in about 10 to 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and the subsequent transfer was to the brains of the baby mice.
The clinical features of human coronavirus-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by human coronavirus-229E, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms of infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and nasal viruses.
Both the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-OC43 virus have spread globally, and tend to mostly pass during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of sickness for about two weeks.
According to a human-volunteer study, healthy individuals infected with human coronavirus-229E have had a mild cold.
Only a few HIV-positive patients showed severe respiratory tract injury.
SARS, also known as "LAMP", is the first well-documented human coronavirus-induced pandemic in human history and its cause was SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
The SARS pandemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the transmission of the infection, it is estimated that one case of infection can lead to about two cases per second, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak viral load appears on the 10th day of illness.
SARS-CoV symptoms begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea, and fever, followed by symptoms of delayed breathing, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Low lymphoma, impaired liver function, and high creatine kinase are common laboratory disorders of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 patients also observe widespread, apparent cell proliferation and increased glomerular cell count.
About 20-30% of patients then need focused care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, in severe cases many organs including the digestive system, liver and kidneys can also be affected and are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be especially fatal in HIV-positive patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to conduct research on the human coronavirus.
The human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, older people, and HIV-positive patients with respiratory diseases.
Cold, inflammatory fever, and smallpox are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the virus itself from a sample of an eight-month-old child's nose suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that the human coronavirus-NL63 is responsible for nearly 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
The human corona virus-NL63 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis, also known as choking.
In the same year, the human coronavirus-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and smallpox in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and smallpox, the human corona virus-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma attacks.
The human coronavirus-HKU1 virus has been found to be globally spread, causing mild respiratory illnesses, similar to the human coronavirus-NL63, human coronavirus-229E, and human coronavirus-OC43.
All four of these community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and generally the likelihood that they will mutate to cause a disease with high rates of spread is low, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more severe subtype of human coronaviruses-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe respiratory infection in China.
In general, when coronaviruses acquire this ability to efficiently transmit and maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less aggressive or pathogenic.
Merce-Kov was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and chronic kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases brought from abroad and a rare secondary transfer of mice have been reported in many European countries and Tunisia through close personal contact.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by MERS are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by acute, exacerbated pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MS also suffered from acute renal failure, which is what makes MS different from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal infectious symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making Mercer-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
During mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients later identified as having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international importance as it has been called by COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial mortality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in Hubei province in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the large homogeneity in the nucleotide sequence of 82% they belong to different branches of the genus evolution tree.
SARS-CoV-2 seems less severe but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It has been reported that people who have been infected with Cov-2 virus have no symptoms and may be contributing to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in gestation and disease duration.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is following the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 infection is tied to SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronavirus (i.e. human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63).
On the one hand, Cove-2 infection shows symptoms that are more common in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the appearance of undetermined, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen, as in SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmission of human coronavirus from society.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human transmission as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the oral anal canal plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
It is interesting whether SARS-CoV-2 may show a seasonal spread as in cases of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including the transmission potential, mechanism of disease and sustainable post-transmission spread to humans, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses, which are socially transmitted and cause mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
There's another perspective, which may also be true, that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the ancient human coronavirus epidemic.
The human coronavirus that infected humans with acute diseases has been eradicated as well as humans infected with acute human coronavirus.
To do this, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow adaptive mutations to accumulate that are faced by restrictive factors in the host.
And from that logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it's hard to stop its transmission between humans through a stony stone or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses spread among populations over many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.
These viruses don't need a livestock warehouse.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which cause severe infection with humans, have not adapted well, and we have not been able to continue to move between humans.
They need to stay in their animal sheds and breed there and then look for the right opportunity to move on to more vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar traits to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.
It's as contagious as human coronaviruses that are passed down from society, at least for now.
However, it causes more infections than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a medium animal repository or host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be useful to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, storage, intermediate, and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal plays the role of an evolutionary host of the human coronavirus if the virus has a closely related origin and shares a large similarity in the level of nucleotide sequences.
The original virus is usually well adapted and not causing infection to this host.
Similarly, the host repository hosts the human coronavirus continuously and for the long term.
In either case, the hosts naturally infect and are natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its paternal virus.
Conversely, if the human coronavirus enters the newly-infected host before or near its human attack, it doesn't adapt well to the new host and often causes a malfunction.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also plays the role of an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and thus transmit it to humans to expand the range of infection among humans.
A human coronavirus infection can reach a dead end if the virus fails to spread from within the median host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the medium host so that they can settle it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Epidemic data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with the outbreakers.
Pre-population surveys later indicated that animal dealers had higher rates of SARS-CoV IgG prevalence compared to normal people.
For the first time, the coated palm larva (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in live animal markets were found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are roughly identical to SARS-CoV.
This is indirectly supported by the fact that no other case of a stray has been reported after all the catfish were killed in the markets.
However, it has been reported that the SARS-CoV test result of wild or farmed live palm oil that is not exposed to live animal markets was largely negative, suggesting that the fermented palm oil may be only a medium-sized host, but not a natural warehouse for SARS-CoV.
Noting that while 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have SARS-CoV antibodies, the likelihood that multiple species of small mammals also play the role of an enlarged intermediate host of SARS-CoV is not excluded.
It looks like all these hosts don't move SARS-CoV.
Research later on on the natural animal host of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called the Chinese equine fever bat virus associated with acute respiratory syndrome HKU3, which is found in Chinese equine fever bats.
The SARS-CoV antibody test in these bats and the Chinese horsehair bat virus sequencing associated with acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 were positive.
This virus and other coronaviruses of bats have a 88-92% similarity in nucleotide sequences to SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human diseases.
Several AASV-like coronaviruses (AASV-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none of them can be isolated as a living virus except for WIV1.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 extract from bat bat bat sample was proven to use the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme in bats, cat bats, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum of those recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to equate to WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the most common SARS-CoV-like virus in bats, as they share a 95% similarity in nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct host of SARS-CoV-2 storage.
Analysis of the evolution of the Merce-Cove strain in the HKU4 coronavirus group in bats and the HKU5 virus in bats themselves is combined.
The corona-HKU4 virus in bats and MERS-CoV uses the same host, the peptide peptide 4, to enter the virus.
The MERS-CoV-based riboside DNA polymerase sequences are more closely related in evolution to their counterparts from the beta coronaviruses in bats that have been identified in Europe and Africa.
Merce-Cow hasn't been discovered to live in wild bats yet.
Mercer-CoV and the HKU25 coronavirus in bats closest to it share a nucleotide sequence similarity of only 87%.
So, bats may not be the direct host warehouse of Mars-Cov.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only beauty is serum-positive male to MERS-CoV antibodies, as well as beauty of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV corresponding to the human virus was isolated from the nasal swabs of the only male beaver, suggesting that the beaver is the original host repository of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that mild symptoms were common in a female who was experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but a high viral prevalence was observed.
The infected chick was not only transmitting viruses through breathing but also through the oral anus, which is the primary route for the virus to spread from bats.
However, questions remain because many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with the beauty before symptoms appear, and these cases have been logically attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission methods involving species of animals not identified by MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RaTG13 in isolated bats from horse-drawn bats is 96.2% nuclear-like.
The sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it's difficult to pinpoint the parent relationship, as in the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV cases.
This means bats may not be the direct host of SARS-CoV-2 unless they find a near-matched coronavirus for bats in the future.
The intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Wuhan seafood market, where many early cases of COVID-19 infection have been linked, suggesting a potential animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenome sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as predatory ant-eaters (Manis javanica) may also harbor the original corona beta viruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The genes of the novel coronavirus virus that feeds on these ants and SARS-CoV-2 share 85-92% of the same nucleotide sequences.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
Two strains of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses are grouped into the evolutionary tree of the strain, one of which shares a similar future-linking domain with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequences matching.
In stark contrast, the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ significantly, although the overall sequence of the genome is similar to the higher.
A previous study on sick ant-eating insects also revealed the presence of viral organisms from samples of the lungs, and it was also found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different assembly and manual processing methods to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of a full-length viral genome of approximately 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that predatory ants are an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that predatory ant eating is the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated corona beta viruses in predatory ant eating.
In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differentiation is less than the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated corona beta viruses in predatory ants.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, predatory ants, and other mammals is still under development.
While the highest sequence similarity in receptor binding domains between SARS-CoV-2 and predatory ant-eating was found, the corona beta viruses associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest sequence similarity of the entire genome.
It is common speculation that the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains in predatory ant-eating SARS-CoV-2 is critical to selective approximation evolution.
There is a proposed counter-synthesis between SARS-CoV-2 in predatory ant-eating of Corona-Beta viruses and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Rearrangement is widespread among corona-beta viruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of Sarkof-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of human coronaviruses-229E, human coronaviruses-OC43, human coronaviruses-NL63, and human coronaviruses-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence for the evolution of the strains has suggested that both the human coronavirus-NL63 and human coronavirus--229E may have originated from bat corona viruses, while the paternal viruses of human coronavirus-OC43 and human coronavirus-HKU1 were found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (High-Plastic Corona Virus) detected in North American three-colored bats has been reported to be closely related to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, human coronavirus-229E was found to be genetically linked to another coronavirus in bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and the infection was also suspected to be hosted by the mediator.
For clarification, the current information on the animal origin of the human coronavirus known is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Gene evolution analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission between species throughout history.
When the human coronavirus-OC43 species passed to humans from livestock around 1890, an outbreak of respiratory infection was recorded.
The date of transmission of human coronavirus-229E between species is still less clear.
The alpha coronaviruses in bats have been found to be closely related to human coronaviruses-229E.
Among them is the alpha coronavirus in Algeria.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological home.
While humans have a close connection to the Alpacas.
Second, human coronavirus-229E, which is related to the corona alpha virus in bats, is multi-pathogenic and nonpathogenic in bats, while the corona alpha virus in the Alps causes outbreaks of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca-related corona virus has not been detected in wild animals.
So, the possibility that the Alpacas were infected with human coronavirus-229E, which is related to human coronavirus alpha, cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause human diseases including the dog disease virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats can transmit human coronavirus-229E directly to humans.
While the corona alpha viruses in bats play the role of assembling the human corona virus genes-229E, alpacas and the unicorn camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just like in Merce Cove.
Merce-Cow provides an excellent example of species-to-species transition. It transitions from bats to unicorn to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the Myrtus-Cov was known from the beginning of its identification and was also reinforced by later results.
Clearly bats provide a rich collection of virus species to exchange genetic fragments within a species and transfer them between species.
Bats have longevity, living in crowded colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly - all favorable conditions to make them the perfect "virus transmitter".
On the other hand, Merce-Cove has moved into the only female beauty in decades.
He could adapt well to this beauty until he went from a middleman host to a natural, stable warehouse host.
Merce-Cov causes a very minor disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its intermittent transmission to humans remains as random as it is, and man is a non-transmitter host for Mars-Cov, where its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of predatory ants, if found, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the Corona-Beta viruses associated with predatory ant eating cause severe disease.
They may be non-carrier hosts for the SARS-CoV-2 of the Corona-Beta virus, like the cat cat in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies will determine the many possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animal species to humans by either proving it or excluding it.
First, bats may be a host and a repository for a virus associated with Cove-2 SARS, which is mostly the same as Cove-2 SARS.
Humans and bats may share the ecological habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, predatory ants can be one of the mid-sized hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans get the virus by slaughtering and eating predatory meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be susceptible to Cov-2 SARS.
There's a reason for the antibody scan in pets and wildlife.
Third, as mentioned above, a reassembly and adaptation of the KV-2 SARS in a third species may have occurred that has contact with bats and predatory ants.
The search for the animal origin of Sarkoff-2 is ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side, there are three main and also important factors in making it easier for coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, the mutation rates are relatively high in riboside DNA duplication.
Estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses, compared to other single-stranded riboside DNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average rate of ~10-4 mutations per year for site 2, depending on the stage of the corona virus adaptation to new hosts.
Coronaviruses include an external corrective ribonuclease enzyme, which causes its deletion to be highly mutagenic and delectable or unable to evolve.
Interestingly, Remdesivir is known for its ability to clone the coronavirus by inhibiting the outer ribonuclease enzyme and the riboside-based DNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is an anti-cancellate agent of SARS-CoV-2, and is scheduled to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations are about a million times higher than the rates of hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt properly to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably low when compared to a high-rotation SARS-CoV, which indicates a higher level of human adaptation.
It seems he may have already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the Merce-CoV, which adapts well to the single-clawed beauty.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the large ribose DNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional chromosome modification and reassembly, thus increasing the likelihood of species-to-species co-evolution, which helps to produce new coronaviruses when conditions become appropriate.
This is backed up by the unique abundance of open reading templates and encoded protein functions near the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly replace the templates through replication of riboside DNA through a unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host that's like a mixing pot, the sequence changes frequently during the replication of the RNA of the coronavirus.
Highly homologous RNAs of full length and secondary genomes may reconstitute to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence for the evolution of strains for natural reconstitution has been discovered in human coronaviruses-HKU1 and human coronaviruses-OC43, in addition to animal coronaviruses as in bat-like acute respiratory syndrome virus-like coronaviruses and bat-like coronaviruses-HKU9.
The virus interacts with the host associated with the transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another major factor influencing species-to-species transmission.
In this regard, we take SARS-CoV reassembly as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during species-to-species transitions.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and cat lizards, it was thought that SARS-CoV is subject to rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations that occur in the receptor binding domain of protein S.
Generally, the receptor-binding domain of the S-protein of the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely propagated by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the amino acid receptor binding domain from 318 to 510 occurs in S1 segment, which is linked to the angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme in addition to the receptor that helps enter the virus.
The receptor-linked domain in SARS-CoV-2 is able to identify the receptor-assisting angiotensin-2 transcriptional enzymes in various animals, including bats, caterpillars, mice, and raccoons, which allows the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only six amino acids have been observed to be different from human and cat spiders' viral isolated samples in receptor binding, four of which are in a future-binding sequence pattern to interact with the future of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
The K479N and S487T variants are found in the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain in cat spiders, which may increase the likelihood of a spike protein interaction in the future of the human angiotensin-2 transcriptional enzyme.
In other words, these two types of amino acid substitutes may be irrelevant to human viral adaptation.
It's worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor found in SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in the S1 unit of S protein, which implicitly indicates that the likelihood of S protein binding in the human angiotensin-2 transcriptional enzyme has changed.
Indeed, a study of the ultra-cold electron microscope indicated that there is a 10- to 20-fold higher likelihood of this association compared to what happens between the human angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme and the S-protein in SARS-CoV.
It's also interesting to determine whether any other type of auxiliary receiver might be needed to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
It's also interesting that the human corona virus-NL63 is also linked to the angiotensin-2 transcriptional enzyme but in a different part of the S protein.
There are many other human coronavirus progenitors, such as the protein analyzer N for human coronavirus-229E, and the 9-O-insulated silica for human coronavirus-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after species have been transferred from their animal hosts.
In addition to the cell receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also subject to other factors of dependence and host restrictions.
The mass of these host proteins between humans and hosts of natural coronavirus repositories, such as bats, unicorns, and rodents, could be a barrier to species-to-species transition.
Human coronaviruses need to control host dependencies and weaken restrictions to carry out successful species-to-species transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this space remain important for the virus's interaction with the host to be detectable and characteristic.
Extensive, unbiased analysis of the genome can be used to look for the dependencies and host limitations of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology.
The emergence of the new human coronavirus: Back to the starting point
The variety of coronaviruses in bats offers ample opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
And from this logic, the coronaviruses in bats are a genetic complex of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic reintegration also drive the evolution of the human coronavirus, which are two important points in the process.
For example, acquiring or losing recovered protein encoding genes involves the ability to modify viral phenotypes to a significant degree.
Among the regulatory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV was isolated from viruses in bats but was found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
The 29 properties of SARS-CoV-like nucleotide erasure were found to be present in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion led to the division of ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptation mutation that enhances host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible reintegration through the strains of the coronaviruses alpha and gamma, where a large number of small reintegration zones have been identified in the RNA-based RNA polymerase.
The reassembly locations were also specified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic has seen cases of reintegration between different breeds, which occurred in the only Sunni beauty in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, rearrangements have also been reported in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have been incorporated with other animal coronaviruses in their nonstructural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also aid in unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely caused by viruses releasing the selective stresses exerted, as happens by the host's immune system.
The loss of the full-length ORF4 protein in the human coronavirus-like-pattern strain 229E due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although the correct ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses associated with human coronavirus-229E, the alpha corona virus that infects the alpaca shows one nucleotide stitching, leading to a cytoplasm.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their own warehouses.
Cases that did not have symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronaviruses, which indicates the mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It showed that bats adapted well to coronaviruses surgically and physiologically.
For example, reduce the weak activation of the inflammatory support response in bats by effectively reducing the pathogens caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the normal killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to an increased rate of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor and a decreased expression level of the major tissue conformation compound class I molecules.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen compound species) arising from high metabolic activity in bats can lead to both the capture of a coronavirus and the effect of correction by the external ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the formation of strains of viruses that are highly pathogenic when a new host is infected.
Additional disease-causing strains of the coronavirus may be created by reassembly, which leads to new protein or protein characteristics to be adapted to the host.
So it's no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in host host animals such as bats and camels.
They clone strongly without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why virus carriers who show no symptoms see and why severe cases of human infection occur.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in patients with non-symptomatic disease, the immune response is separate from the coronavirus replication.
A similar strategy to immune response isolation may have useful effects in SARS-CoV-2 anti-therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking type I interferon can benefit at least in the first stage of human Cov-2 infection.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particle cryopyrin NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, inhibiting the inflammatory particle cryopyrin NLRP3 using the inhibitor MCC950 is useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While it was discovered that the beta corona virus in bats shared SARS-CoV-95% in nucleotide homogenization, there was also a corona virus in bats that shared 96% of nucleotide homogenization with SARS-CoV-2.
While caterpillars and other animals in the markets were found to have SARS-CoV-like viruses, they did not detect the intermediate direct hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Corona beta viruses have been detected in predatory ants that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting predatory ants may be an intermediate host or that corona beta viruses in predatory ants have contributed to genetic cuts that led to the arrival of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was man-made either by accident or accident.
Coronaviruses have returned to the spotlight with the onset of the latest SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studying coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our thinking about the importance of animal disease origins and animal repositories of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The damaging evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that SARS-CoV infection originated from human-cat contact in the markets, closing the fresh produce markets and killing the cat was supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
In the same logic, predatory ants should be eliminated from fresh produce markets to prevent animal-borne disease transmission, in light of the discovery of multiple strains of the beta corona virus in predatory ants that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans, and whatever its transmission method, through predatory ants and other mammals, remains a topic that needs clarification in future research.
On the other hand, Merce-Cove was found in the only male beauty for a long time.
These beauties are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for local citizens.
It's widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it's impossible to sacrifice the best to control Mars, as well as what wildlife market officials in China have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV beauty vaccines, as well as other measures to combat infection.
To prevent these viruses from being completely eradicated, new genetic patterns may develop and cause outbreaks.
There are a variety of coronaviruses associated with animal diseases that originate in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses are highly diverse in bats, which imply the likelihood of causing animal diseases.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and reintegration of animal-borne coronaviruses, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to minimize unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the hardships faced by humanity due to SARS, MERS and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be developed.
The fact suggests that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural warehouses until they have the opportunity to spread and multiply.
Although bats have many characteristics that prevent the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that forces them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary step to better understand the environment of coronavirus and its natural hosts, proving its usefulness in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-borne viral diseases is to distance humans from the natural environments of animal-borne virus stores.
The mystery of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to predatory ants, it's important to know the conditions that led to the bats and predatory ants sharing the same ecological environment.
Second, if bats play a direct role in transmitting disease to humans to a greater extent, then the way humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third species of mammal is the true mediator host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and predatory ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether the host is a bat, predatory ant or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or the parent virus from which it branches is expected to be identified and approximately matched in its natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathway of Cove-2 SARS in animals, with important measures to prevent and combat COVID-19 in humans.
The need to update the criteria of "suspected" and "confirmed" when diagnosing COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection, and this guidance provided our experience and included relevant reference information to fight the pandemic globally.
Although the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is a new disease, our awareness and awareness is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiments; and so diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to Ward's comment on our guidance and introduced the newest diagnostic criteria, "suspected status" and "confirmed status", in line with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (edition 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (RCoV-2019) broke out, which has now officially become known as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and has given the virus the name Corona virus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team prepared a quick guidance and published it online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It's been getting a lot of attention since it was published.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and awareness is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; and so diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, issued from the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (/http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, seven total releases with some contexts changed with a substantial change.
Now, our guidance is responding to a comment from Cho and others, who made a simple suggestion for monitoring scores based on clinical trials.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guiding principles and have also become a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their great efforts and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest guidelines for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment (trial version 7) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirming a suspected condition requires combining any of the characteristics of the epidemiologic history and two clinical manifestation elements to arrive at a comprehensive analysis, or requires verifying three elements of the clinical manifestation elements in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemic patient history: (1) a history of travel to and residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported, within the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (with positive DNA test results); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported within the last 14 days before symptoms began; (4) a history of contact with more than one case (of the cases and/or other cases, including those in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, and in the home, in the home, in the home, in the home, and in the home, in the home, in the home, and in the home, and in the like.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics demonstrated by imaging for COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a normal, low, or low total white blood cell count of lymphocytes in the early stage of infection.
The diagnosis of the confirmed condition must be based on the suspected condition involving any of the following evidence elements: (1) positive result of a real-time PCR SARS-CoV-2 test; (2) high homogenization of the full viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus characteristics; (3) positive results of IgM and IgG antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 in serum; or a change in IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or that the level of the standard in recovery is equal to or greater than 4 levels in the same phase.
We see that the real-time sequence polymerase interaction test for DNA in respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second version (January 18, 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020).
The discovery of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then the blood serum interactions guide was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications have been based on the ongoing work of researchers to come up with the perfect set of DNA detection tools for rapid diagnosis, plus respiratory samples including blood samples, which has led to increased availability of various samples, and supporting the transfer of positive antibody outcomes to confirmed case standards.
In addition, there is growing evidence that calls for caution when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and uncommon conditions.
So the content of the information flow chart should be updated for DFO and others, where they classified the clinically symptom-free person as "low risk".
The score monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and in additional clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to get more direct evidence as we invite readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose a suspected and a confirmed case, we call for the most recent guidance from the countries of origin of the persons to be followed and followed.
Our team will also provide our timely guidance to help.
Bangladesh records five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
That's the most deaths in a single day from the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology and Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, the number of registered cases has reached 114 active cases and 33 home-based recovery cases.
There have been 17 deaths.
Director of the Institute of Epidemiology and Research, Dr. Mergady Sabrina Flora, reported at an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mergady, there were two cases of people over 60, two cases of people between 51 and 60, and one case of people between 41 and 50.
She also said two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An Anadolu hospital official told the local news agency that one of the dead was Jalal Seef Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Agency, who was being cared for at Kuwait Maitrey Hospital.
Bangladesh's Minister of Land Transport and Bridges, Abid al-Qadar, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport will be shut down for longer than originally scheduled, until next Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transportation of basic goods, namely medical products, fuel and food, is still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, for two people from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three had already recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases has surpassed 2 million worldwide.
The data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of the coronavirus that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome has exceeded one million cases worldwide, with SARS-CoV-2 being the most common.
COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus has caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first cases of the coronavirus, and the first death related to it was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it is one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization has reported 105,1635 confirmed cases, as of yesterday, of which 79,332 cases during the 24 hours prior to 10 a.m. central European time (00:00 GMT) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths associated.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday from coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced on Thursday that the city's lockdown will be extended until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians will continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes, 10 abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the two holy cities of Mecca and the holy city of Mannah to the whole day, where it was previously only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor, Mr. Mike D. Wayne, announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australia's stores are lowering the purchase limit for toilet paper per treatment.
Two Australian Wal-Worth and Coles retail chains on Saturday and Sunday evenings have tightened restrictions on toilet paper purchases to reduce them to two lofts of Wal-Worth stores and one loft of Coles stores per transaction across the country.
And I set aside one roll of Aldi's stores, which was Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as letters at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have offered to store them out of concern about COVID-19 in case people need self-isolation.
Wall-Worth stores on Wednesday passed a restriction on toilet paper delivery to homes to become one wrapper per purchase order.
These changes came after previous restrictions passed by the Wallworths stores on March 4 and the Coles stores on March 5 allowed only four wrappers per transaction.
Coles Stores reported in its March 8 press release that despite the four-wrap restrictions, "many stores still sell everything they have within an hour of receiving it", and described the request as "unprecedented", as well as Aldi Stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as "unexpected".
Sales have increased "a lot" in the past week, according to a spokesman for Wall Street.
As Costco's store in Canberra last week determined, the amount allowed to buy is two liters.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles Stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased delivery speeds, and Wal-Worthes Stores asked for additional inventory, while Aldi Stores made their inventory available for special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retailers' Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on delivery times made it harder.
Production costs are expected to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with limited special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi's announced that due to early availability of stock, some stores will not be able to offer Wednesday's special offer.
Dr. Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, reported in a report to News.com.au that shops fill stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large commodity, which leads to a decrease in inventory in terms of numbers, and when sold in full, leaves a large amount of empty space on the shelves, which increases the feeling of want.
Russell Zimmerman, quoted by ABC News, said: "Cool's and Wal-Worth stores have a view that [that] if there are too many goods on the shelves, and if they can [buy] products like toilet wrappers and sterilizers and save them in large quantities, that might lessen the panic".
Who Gives a Crap, a recycled toilet paper company, reported last Wednesday that its stock was running out.
According to News.com.au, Cumberly-Clark, which makes Clinix toilet towels, and Solaris Pepper, which makes Sorbent towels, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue to supply their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some real estate sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at the Melbourne auction, while fewer auctions were held due to buyers not working on the long Labor Day weekend.
A Thursday edition of the Daily News, a daily newspaper in Darwin, included eight-page advertisements made so that they could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores initially hesitated about restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on 3 March, where stores said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including blankets, sterilizers, dry goods, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, a British online store called Okado noted that it was specifying the purchase of Andres toilet paper in two 12-fold sheets.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) - has reached the epidemic level.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the disease, not the severity of certain cases, the World Health Organization has warned of the need to push governments to take the necessary measures:
"All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gibresos said: "If countries discovered and tested people, treated and isolated them, tracked their cases and mobilized them to confront them".
"We are all very concerned about the levels of spread and alarming risk as well as the levels of risk-advised decline".
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a statement published by CNN in February, he said, "No other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset of its onset to its continued global spread, except the flu".
Gibrisos expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never been hit by a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"And we've never seen a controllable flu at the same time".
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the outbreak of a public health emergency of international concern.
"The bottom line is that things are going to get worse", said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide since Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The basic treatment is supportive treatment and symptomatic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people in contact, monitoring and self-isolation of those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world are responding to this risk by imposing travel restrictions, sanitation, travel bans, workplace hazard controls and closure.
The pandemic has led to a severe global social and economic disorder, with postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread on the Internet, and there have been incidents of foreign terrorism and discrimination against Chinese, and others with East Asian and Southeast Asian origins and appearances, and other areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel rates and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China reported a group of cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
Cases are mostly linked to Wuhan's wholesale seafood market, so the virus is thought to be of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to coronaviruses in bats, coronaviruses in scabies, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person to show symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and that person had no clear contact with the later discovered wet market group.
Of the group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning newspaper indicated that a case dating back to November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, may have been the first case. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although new cases in China have been reported to have declined, they have increased abruptly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases inside for the first time.
There may be a significant lack of reporting, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with adults aged 19 and under constituting 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of Britons would need to be infected before an effective herd immunisation procedure could be performed.
Cases indicate the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and confirmed infected according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has ever tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have official policies not to test only those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China, as of January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
Statistical analysis estimates published on 30 March indicated that the number of casualties in Italy was much higher than the recorded cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 ranged between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 has caused approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China since February 5 have been concentrated in people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths from COVID-19 flu generally refer to those who have been confirmed to have COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without being tested - for example, at home, or in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official recorded number of COVID deaths by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States acknowledged "that we know that [the number of deaths announced] reflects a lower estimate than reality", a statement supported by narrative reports that point to the inaccuracy of the limitation in the United States. Such underestimates occur in cases of epidemics; such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China was on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths outside mainland China had been recorded in both Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options and time taken since the outbreak began, population characteristics such as age, gender, and public health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death to injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of injury mortality dropped from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measurements indicate a case mortality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of patients who died from the disease, and an infection mortality rate (IFR) that reflects the percentage of patients (who were confirmed to have and who were not confirmed to have) who die from the disease.
These statistics don't have a time frame and they track a specific population from injury to the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medical Center estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate for this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 test in Germany, and with a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on estimates of the mortality rate.
The World Health Organization stresses the feasibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
"Infectious disease outbreaks that go uncontrolled usually peak and then begin to decline when the disease is not available.
But it's almost impossible to make any logical prediction right now about when that will happen".
Chinese government chief medical adviser Chung Nanchan said it could be "finished by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Conservation Health and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 "will be widespread for perhaps a year or two".
According to a study by the London Imperial College under the supervision of scientist Neil Ferguson, we will have to rely on physical distancing and other measures "until a vaccine is available (possibly after 18 months or more)".
William Shaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's possible that this coronavirus will disappear completely because it's easily transmissible", and "it could turn into a seasonal disease that comes back every year".
The severity of the return will depend on the group's immunity and the extent of the transformation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecified and may not show symptoms in those infected.
The two most common are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, breathing blockage (blom), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cramping, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or diarrhea. The World Health Organization reports that about one in six people suffer from severe illness and difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States limits emergency symptoms to difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and bruising of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Some patients, who do not have clinical symptoms, may not show symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm their infection, so specialists suggest that people who have been infected should be monitored for confirmed cases and examined closely to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the number of cases without symptoms range from a few to 44 percent.
The usual incubation period (the period between infection and symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of a confusion case, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and then recently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being investigated.
The disease is thought to spread mainly during mixing or by spraying when coughing, sneezing or talking; this is when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without mouth covering can result in spraying that ranges from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some believe that the virus may also be transmitted by airborne spraying that is stuck in the air for a long time, which may be produced during speech. It may also produce respiratory spraying during the whispering process, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally transmitted through the air.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary prevention and rehabilitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray and then spread through the air.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Despite concerns about the potential for spreading from the stool to the mouth, it is believed that the risk is limited.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from feces to the mouth. The virus is more contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been confirmed to have the disease up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that it can spread before severe symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of lab-confirmed symptom-free cases, but symptom-free transition has been identified by some countries during misdiagnosis surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some uncertainty as to how easily the disease spreads, one person can generally infect two to three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on polypropylene and 304 stainless steel, one day on hard-paste paper, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend washing hands after mixing animals, as is the case when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
The coronavirus 2 associated with SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, where three people with mixed pneumonia were isolated for the first time for a group of cases of severe respiratory disease in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all its characteristics with naturally occurring coronaviruses. Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus, where it melts its immune membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It's thought to have animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically related to the corona virus genus beta, and is classified under the subgenus of the SARS virus (genus B) plus two bat-derived strains.
It matches 96% of the entire genome with other bat coronaviruses.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between viruses created by predatory ants and viruses created by humans.
The entire genome comparison so far has resulted in the discovery of a maximum 92% genetic link between the coronavirus of predatory ants and SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is insufficient to prove that predatory ants are the median family of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by the reverse transcriptase sequence polymerase (RRT-PCR) reaction of infected secretions or computed tomography.
A study in Wuhan compared the interaction of the polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography to indicate that computed tomography is more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties intermingling with pneumonia and other pathogenic stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiography recommends "not using computerized CT to detect COVID-19 or as a preliminary screening for diagnosis".
The World Health Organization published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time on January 17.
The test uses the real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on samples of the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done by a nasal swab, and a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing a linear test to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them have been sufficiently accurate to be widely adopted.
The silicon-based serum test developed by SELIX has been approved for emergency use in the United States only in licensed laboratories.
The imaging characteristics of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) imaging for people with unparalleled endothelial disease symptoms such as glazed glass fog and distorted crystalline lavage.
The Italian Radiological Society has compiled an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiographic imaging without the sequential polymerase interaction is a limited precision procedure for detecting COVID-19, due to its interference with other diseases such as gastrointestinal viral infection.
A large study in China compared CT scans of the chest and the interaction of the polymerase chain reaction and proved that although the imaging is less accurate in terms of proving infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it be considered a screening tool in infected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging properties of the virus in both radioactive imaging and computed tomography.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, using a towel when coughing or sneezing and then throwing it directly in a garbage can.
Those already infected are advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical isolation measures are also recommended to prevent transmission of infection. Several governments have banned or advised against unnecessary travel from and to the countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading to entire society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they got it. Healthcare providers, who care for a person who may be infected, recommend that they take the appropriate measures, mix precautions and eye protection. Tracking infected people with a mixture is an effective way to help health authorities identify the source of infection and prevent its spread.
Governments' use of location-tracking data from mobile phones for tracking purposes has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding restrictions on such surveillance.
Many mobile apps have been designed or launched for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have worked to find privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach someone who has been proven to have COVID-19. It promotes misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, washing the nose and throat with mouthwash is not a good solution.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, despite the work of many organizations to produce a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when there is a clot on their hands, before eating, after empty noses, coughing or thirst.
That's because household soap kills the virus outside the body, destroying its immune membrane.
The CDC also recommends using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when water and soap are not available.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be purified using several purifiers (within one minute of placing the purifier on a stainless steel surface), including: ethanol 6271%; isopropanol 50100%; sodium hydroxide 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodophophedon 0.27.5%.
There are other purifiers, such as benzodiazepine chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, that are less effective.
The CDC recommends that when someone is suspected of having or has been confirmed infected with COVID in an office or care facility, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces, and shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, either bend their elbows and place them in front of their mouths and noses or use a paper diaper and get rid of any diapers immediately.
For those who are likely to be infected, medical masks are recommended, as wearing the mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it travels when it spreads due to speech, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce [people's] desire to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if their hands are not properly cleaned".
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as those caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun encouraging ordinary people to wear face masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing non-medical facial masks made of cloth. China specifically recommended healthy people wear disposable medical masks, especially if people are mixed up (one meter (3 feet) or less) directly.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out into public places without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has required anyone entering grocery stores to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on trains and intercity buses wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a face mask when going out mandatory, while also recommending making face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes anti-infection measures aimed at slowing down the spread of disease by minimizing interpersonal mingling.
These include roadblocks; travel restrictions; closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without touching, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if COVID-19 is not detected in the region) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings for more than two people. Elderly people and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure, weak immune systems are at increased risk of serious diseases and complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised them to stay at home as much as possible in areas of outbreaks among communities. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health bodies began using the term "social distancing" instead of "physical distancing", to illustrate that the goal of reducing physical contact with the public is to maintain social distancing, or to maintain social distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommending that you only have sex with someone you live with who is not infected or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for COVID-19 patients and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-isolation stone on all residents living in the affected areas.
The strongest self-hygiene stone instructions were issued to those of the most vulnerable groups.
Those who have dealt with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted are advised to have self-medication for 14 days from the time of another possible exposure.
Strategies to control outbreaks are to contain or curb and limit the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected as well as introduce other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease becomes impossible to contain, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Containment requires tougher measures to reverse the course of the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the infectious disease outbreak management tries to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of stress in health services and saves more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-medical interventions that may address outbreaks include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-health stone; community actions aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gathering events; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. Tougher measures were taken to contain the outbreak in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as applying sanitary stone to entire cities and imposing a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and local sanitation, and issued alerts about the movements of the infected.
Singapore has provided financial support to injured self-isolate individuals and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Simulation of the United Kingdom and the United States shows that mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic rather than stopping it) and containment (contrary to epidemic growth) face major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for healthcare by two-thirds and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress on health systems.
Containment may be preferable, but it should be maintained as long as the virus is spread to humans (or until the vaccine is available, if this happens first), as the transition on the other hand reverts quickly when measures are mitigated.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and rest may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen, venous fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
Using steroids can make the results worse.
Many compounds that have been previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are undergoing testing for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" could provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare centres to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 patients, increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available artificial respirators and household.
There are multiple theories about where the first case (called patient zero) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hobi, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these animal species; or in other words, it has animal origin. A group with pneumonia was observed for an unknown reason on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jiejian at Hubei County Hospital, who reported it to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control in Buhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Lee Wen-Liang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ewen, was reprimanded by her superiors for setting off the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the World Health Organization.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia have been reported to the Wuhan health authorities, prompting them to start investigating in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, with the help of movements during Chinese New Year and Wuhan becoming a transportation hub and a major railway junction.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later announced official data show that 6,174 people already had symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy in the world's highest number of confirmed cases. As of 9 April 2020, reports indicated there were over 1.61 million cases worldwide, with over 97,000 people dead and over 364,000 people recovering.
I've reported about 200 countries and territories with at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as sanitation (known as stay-at-home orders, place-of-protection orders, or lockdowns) and a travel ban. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, had been subjected to some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people had been subjected to lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people had been subjected to lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people had been subjected to lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were subjected to some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jiejian noticed a series of pneumonia cases whose cause is unknown on December 26, and she reported to her hospital at the Jianghan Bohan Center for Disease Control on December 27.
A preliminary genetic test of samples of patients on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
The WHO was notified the same day.
In the presence of these notices, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of the transfer from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
Described as "the biggest health stone in human history", a health collar was announced on January 23 to stop traveling from Wuhan and beyond, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
Private vehicles are prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been canceled in several places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshinshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, the Lichenshan Hospital, to handle the additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health advertisements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken several measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Remote action measures have been taken in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hobby.
Public transportation has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed throughout China.
Public traffic controls were restricted in several cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) were subjected to some form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "bringing" it from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory health stone on all returnees to the city from other countries. On March 23, one local case was transferred to mainland China over the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chairman of the State Council of China Li Keqiang stated that the spread of locally transmitted infections and control of outbreaks in China had decreased.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were relaxed on the same day, except for Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the suspension of entry of visa holders or residence permits from March 28 onwards, with no specific details on when this policy expires.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to resume work on March 30, and provided a set of monetary incentives to companies. The State Council announced a three-minute day of mourning beginning with silence on April 4 at 10:00 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to show respect online in consideration of physical distancing to avoid a COVID-19 outbreak again.
COVID-19 transmission from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, and this is greatly encouraged by a rally in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheongji Jesus Church.
I suspect Shincheongji's followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan are the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 people, or about 13% of the 9,336 church followers, reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest alert levels on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were sanitized after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and then changed. South Korea implemented what was considered the world's largest and best regulation program to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected and track who was infected and subject them to a sanitizer.
The screening methods included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via a mobile app, testing the virus on people in their cars until the test results were available the next day, and increasing the testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program represents a success in controlling the outbreak despite the lack of sanitization of entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either to isolate Moon, alleging that the government has abused the outbreak, or to praise his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that from April 1st all newcomers from abroad would be subjected to quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test the virus.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, where two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting activities, Friday prayers, closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine the affected areas, only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to limit inter-city travel were announced in March, although heavy inter-city traffic continued ahead of the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrine in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Amid claims of Iran's cover-up of its outbreak, more than a dozen countries have tracked cases from Iran since February 28, suggesting that the outbreak could exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly infected with the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful protest, and also temporarily release qualified prisoners.
She said there is a high risk of the virus spreading in indoor areas like prisons, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 current and former Iranian politicians and government officials have died from the disease by March 17.
By March 23, Iran was registering 50 new cases of coronavirus in an hour, and one death every 10 minutes.
According to a World Health Organization official, the number of cases in Iran may be as high as five times the number reported.
It is also believed that US sanctions on Iran may affect the state's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for easing economic sanctions on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on January 31, when SARS-CoV-2 tests for Chinese tourists in Rome came back positive.
Cases have begun to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights from and to China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated set of COVID-19 cases were later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, including sanitation for more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "It will not be allowed to enter or leave the outbreak areas.
I have already been ordered to suspend work and sporting activities in those areas". On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, with 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including first-class football matches, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthetics, Rehabilitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics regarding the allocation protocols that can be used.
On March 19, Italy overtook China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On March 22, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, the number of confirmed cases was 128,948, the number of deaths was 15,887, and 21,815 cases were reported in Italy, most of these cases in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report suggested that a combination of a large number of older people and the inability to test all those infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the higher mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as the slowest among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive sanitation measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its remarkable lack of speed and severity in responding to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising to avoid unnecessary travel or social disruption, suggesting people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a maximum of £2,500 per month to reduce unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, with gatherings for more than two people prohibited and travel and outdoor activity restricted except for the extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police by issuing fines and dispersing gatherings.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for "essential" commercial projects, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and nurseries.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the leading public health institute of the U.S. government, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed the start of the test, blocking the real extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test corrupted a defective test set produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental test sets (by academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor's order was required afterwards).
By February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests were being conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

On March 25, the governor said social distancing appears to have been successful, with estimates showing a slow doubling of cases from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died from the virus. On March 26, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people died.

The Trump administration's crisis has not received widespread acclaim, causing widespread polarization among parties.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized the U.S. reliance on importing essential materials, including basic medical supplies, from China.
Air travel pattern analysis was used to map and predict the prevalence patterns and was published in the journal Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Union 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei had the highest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for travelers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable of more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia released its emergency response plan to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
She said that not much has been discovered yet about the COVID-19 virus, and that Australia will emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a state of emergency for human biosecurity was declared in Australia.

A medical examination is conducted before departure, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus are left to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans whose test results were negative were returned.
The test results showed that South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who all remained, as a precaution, under surveillance and quarantine at the Ranch Resort for 14 days, were uninjured.

Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa have welcomed China's help well. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The World Health Organization noted the difference between the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of blackout that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government has provided "regular updates to avoid panic before the Lunar New Year holiday".
On January 23, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gooden Galia noted that while this was "not necessarily a recommendation from the WHO", it was "a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is heavily concentrated", describing it as "unprecedented in the history of public health". On January 30, after the confirmation of the transfer from person to person outside China, and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEI), the sixth state of emergency from the state of public health to the state of emergency to be declared by the UN since the country's adoption in 2009.
The WHO Director-General said that the outbreak is considered a public health emergency of international concern because of "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that are unnecessarily in conflict with international travel and trade" and that "the World Health Organization does not recommend restricting trade and mobility".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization urged the international community to contribute $675 million to the strategic funds prepared in low-income countries, pointing to the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus, even if it does appear".
Tedros also made statements declaring that "we are only measured by the strength of the weakest person in us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a big price later". On February 11, the World Health Organization launched the disease, at a press conference, as COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros reported that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to present "the full potential of the UN system in response".
As a result, a UN crisis management team was set up, which allowed the UN to coordinate its entire response, and the WHO would allow it "to focus on the health response while leveraging the expertise of other agencies to learn about the broader social, economic, and developmental impacts of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was set up to bring international experts and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist local management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and city level, including urban and rural areas". On 25 February, WHO announced that "the world must do more to prepare for a potential coronavirus pandemic", noting that earlier because it was described as "starving", countries should only be "in the vaccination phase".
In response to the spread of the outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "extremely high", its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that "this is a real test for every government on earth: so we have to be prepared.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared for it", urging the right response measures that can help the world avoid "what's worse".
Ryan also noted that the current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means "we basically accept that every person on this planet will be exposed to this virus".
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said it was "deeply concerned by the alarming levels of prevalence, severity, and alarming levels of decline". The WHO faced severe criticism of what it saw as an inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including delaying the declaration of a public health emergency, and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
The violent reaction included a petition by World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts affirmed respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government has the responsibility.
The group stressed that a lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts stress that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, the homeless, the homeless, those living in very poor conditions, the detained, as well as refugees and other unnamed groups who need government support.
International non-governmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

Several CPC directors at several sectoral levels have been fired for their handling of quarrying efforts in central China, in a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe that this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public discontent over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Cao Lijian, have previously denied that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of US or Italian-backed conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The US administration of Donald Trump has described the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying China "imposed a blackout on the news that has exacerbated the virus that is now a global pandemic", which some critics have criticized for being racist "and distracting [attention] from its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast got a U.S. government cable that reviewed the communications schedule from clear sources at the National Security Council, stating strategically that "Everything is about China.
We were asked to seek out and publish these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "News sources such as Politico, Forensic Policy and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push for global influence.
European Union foreign policy official Josep Borrell warned of the existence of "a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of circumvention and generosity policies".
Burrell also said, "China is pushing hard for a message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
U.S. sanctions have banned Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
The US authorities were also accused of transferring aid to other countries to their own country.
There have been reported masks-related conflicts between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Mauritz Masari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said, "China has responded only on a bilateral level.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity".
On March 22, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military ambulances, special cleaning cars, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italy's La Stampa quoted a "high-level political source" who did not mention that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "ineffective or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" attack on Laft.
Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, and Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when he offers help to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American medical equipment and materials manufacturers get active again, they will also be able to repay if necessary".
NATO's planned "Defense 2020" military drills will be held in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest military exercise NATO has conducted since the end of the Cold War on a narrow scale.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 Guns Training, saying: "Due to the current public health crisis, the training not only endangers the lives of troops from the United States and many European countries involved but also the populations of the countries in which it will be conducted". The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about 20 MPs as well as 15 other former or current political figures infected.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020 asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted calls to the United States to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, including comprehensive health care, comprehensive child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative sanitation efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be put in sanitation at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have either signed petitions calling for Moon's isolation because they claim the government mismanaged the outbreak or praised its response. The pandemic allowed states to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this might allow governments to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by an indefinite decree, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who published false information about the virus and the government dealing with the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for many supply shortages due to the increasing global use of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply cuts.
Many areas also saw panic buying, which led to shelves empty of basic groceries such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing a shortage of supplies.
The tech industry has warned in particular of delayed shipments of electronic goods.
According to the statement by World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adenom, the demand for personal protective equipment could double by 100 times.
This demand has led to prices rising up to 20 times the average price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed for between four and six months.
It's also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has given Diego shoppers a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived the severe shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat the storage and illicit trade of bio-products have succeeded in avoiding the severe food shortage expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy's large agricultural production has not seen a significant decline, but prices may rise as industry representatives expect.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork supplies to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to keep inventories for such emergencies.
China has felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was badly hit in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, the virus outbreak has been noted as posing a major, alarming threat to global economic stability.
Agatha Demaris of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential outcomes was revealed.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the global supply chain is affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
OPEC has reportedly seen a "disruption" after sharp fall in oil prices due to declining demand from China.
Global stock markets plummeted on February 24 due to the large increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded their biggest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, its biggest one-day decline since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
The three weeks ended with the index falling more than 10%.
On February 28, Scop Ratings confirmed GMPH's sovereign credit rating for China, but it kept negative expectations.
The stock fell again due to fears of the coronavirus, and the biggest drop was on March 16.
Many people think that economic recession is possible.
Economist Mohammad Al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than they did in the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the warning of travel to governments around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Kants, while British regional airline, FlyB, crashed.
The impact on the cruise industry was unprecedented.
Many train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The pandemic coincided with the travel season of the Chunyun Spring Festival, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of crowded events, including New Year's celebrations, with private companies also closing their stores independently and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibits.
In 24 provinces out of 31 provinces, and in municipalities and regions across China, authorities have extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, and have issued instructions to most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the response to infectious diseases to a high level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled New Year celebrations.
Travel to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50 to 60 percent decline.
This also led to a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping centre operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermometer scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of reactors. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would otherwise be without famine.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the Wuhan pandemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's roughly 300 million rural migrant workers are trapped in their homes in Inland Provinces, or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs lost in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The closure in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid by daily wages) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian families suffered some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany sent their workers into government-backed short-term business plans known as Courzarbet.
France and Britain have adopted a German short-term work compensation plan.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sector has been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organisations as well as working and independent individuals globally.
Institutions in the arts and culture sector have sought to support their (often government-funded) mission to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, maintain the safety of their staff and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, around the world, to varying degrees, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, shows canceled or postponed.
In response there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Among other recent accelerating repercussions of the disease are the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian season of Lent.
Many Christian parishes have recommended that older Christians stay home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live Internet or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome's churches and chapels, and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, synagogues, and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as its residents from entering the holy places in Mecca and the city.
This pandemic has caused the biggest disruption to the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 Europa League, the 2019-20 NBA NBA season, and the 2019-20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak disrupted the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be rescheduled to post-2020 but no later than summer 2021".
This has led many gamblers to switch to online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with different bands suspended or concert tours canceled.
Many big theaters like the ones on Broadway have suspended all the shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing the work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live concerts or creating online "celebrations" for artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
There are many internet memes about the coronavirus on the Internet where a lot of it turns into humor and entertainment in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, extreme prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, against people of the hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries have been observed.
Incidents of fear, doubt and enmity have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, Asia and the Pacific.
Reports released in February (when most cases were still confined to China) documented racial feelings expressed by various groups around the world towards Chinese people that they deserve the virus or receive what is allegedly justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also been high in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in the areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak spread to new hot spots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may be exposed to skepticism and foreign hatred. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to pressure Chinese to stop entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan# is released on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and the US reported rising levels of racial abuse, as well as assaults.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzary.
Students coming from northeast India, which shares a border with China, and who study in India's major cities, have faced harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal unit, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God has avenged them".
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned these statements, calling them "wrong". In China, the pandemic has led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, where foreigners have been described as "foreign garbage" and targeted "to get rid of them".
Many newspapers have removed paid subscription pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers on the outbreak open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their findings on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

The practical testing of the 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus where antibodies that produce an infection response are identified.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where the ribose DNA of the coronavirus is detected.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect the riboside DNA of SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm very recent or active cases.
Antibody detection (antimatter) is used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were so mild that they were not reported or who showed no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population in March 2020.
On March 23, no country ever tested more than 3% of its population, and there's a huge increase in the number of tests done by different countries.
This discrepancy is also likely to have a significant impact on reported mortality rates, which may be overestimated in some countries.
Using the RRT-PCR (reverse transcriptional momentum polymerase chain reaction) examination can be performed on respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including a nasal pulmonary swab or a bulg sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
It's not based on RT-PCR, which is only done with a throat scan in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are screened in the second week, a sample from the deep airway can instead be taken by a cough catheter or using a coughing agent (plug).
One early PCR test was invented at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the reverse transcript random sequence polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech also developed a SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) suitable for safe clinical use and based on PCR on 28 January 2020.
Looking for the "E" gene in which all SARS-CoV-2 viruses share the beta and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp genes, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection team. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes its 2019 novel coronavirus (CoV-2019) diagnostic panel based on the current RT-PCR on public health labs through the International Disposable Materials Provider Agency.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits resulted in inconclusive results due to faulty detectors, and one test phase was delayed from others at the CDC in Atlanta; this has resulted in the successful completion of an average of less than 100 samples per day of testing throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two trusted ingredients did not have until February 28, 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The FDA approved the test under an emergency use permit. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a nationwide COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; the sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Center for Research in Virology and Biotechnology has developed and produced a COVID-19 test, Victor.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Health Care Administration registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be done in 3.5 hours on large quantities, allowing one machine to conduct nearly 4,128 tests over 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EAU) to Abbott Laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Svend received a similar emergency use permit from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the equal-temperature DNA amplification technique instead of PCR.
Since this doesn't require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a single-gen antibody specifically bound to the novel coronavirus's nuclear cage protein (protein N), in the hope that it can achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "Chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed CT] results may be clear even before symptoms appear".
Common features that appear in computer-generated imaging include bi-sided multi-slit glass barrel with an irregular peripheral and backward distribution.
The spread develops under the gland and irregular spots appear and intensify as the disease progresses.
A study in Wuhan compared PCR and CT imaging with respect to the origin of the current pandemic, indicating that PCR is more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties intermingling with pneumonia and other pathogenic stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiographers recommended "not using computed tomography to detect COVID-19 or as a preliminary examination for diagnosis of disease". In March 2020, the CDC recommended using PCR for preliminary examination.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in individuals within a period starting from 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immunity, and in case of population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or by testing at a clinical point of care (POCTs).
The highly-performing automated systems in many clinical labs will be able to perform these tests, but how much they are available will depend on the output rate of each system.
For central laboratories, one sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although sequential samples can be taken to monitor immune response.
For clinical point of care testing, one blood sample is usually drawn through a skin piercing.
Unlike PCR methods, the synthesis step does not need to be performed before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA identified 29 entities that submitted a notification to the agency in accordance with the requirements and so these entities can distribute what they have of antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one test under emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European accreditations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test takes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is then much faster than traditional PCR analysis of viral riboside DNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK discovered that the antibody testing equipment it had purchased was not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has a plan under which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department gives patients a sample tube", spits in the tube, and returns them again to get a test result after a short period. The UK's NHS has announced that it is testing a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus excluding infection from patients upon arrival at the hospital or the need to sterilize the ambulance used. When testing COVID-19 for suspected cases without leaving the car, the healthcare authority withdraws appropriate risk of transmission from the infected.
The South Korean in-vehicle testing centres have enabled a collection of the fastest and most comprehensive tests globally. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians announced on March 2 that it was able to conduct about 12,000 tests daily for outpatients and 10,700 people were tested last week.
Health insurance will cover the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests a week.
On March 19, vehicle virus detection tests were conducted in several major cities.
On 26 March 2020 the total number of tests carried out in Germany was not known, as only positive cases were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting from the calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of the week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technician and Rambam Hospital devised a method to screen samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and subjected that method to testing, by collecting samples and not conducting further tests until the sample group turns out to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI opened a temporary emergency detection lab with an area of 2,000 square meters and an English name: FireEye, which can now be used for more than 10,000 eyes.
With Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, overseeing the construction and taking 5 days to complete, modeling operations showed that the cases in Hubei would have risen by 47% and the associated cost of sanitation would have doubled if the capacity to perform the test had not been met.
Wuhan Lab may immediately follow the establishment of Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 daily tests. Origami Assays has released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 samples for a patient to detect COVID-19 using just 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for automated fluid processors.
In March, the lack of detectors and their inadequacy caused a standoff when a large number of tests were conducted in the EU, UK and US.
This is some specialists to explore sampling protocols that include heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release the riboside DNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is ranked top of the world in terms of coronavirus testing for its population, and is on track to raise the level of testing to reach most of the population.
This was through a combination of activating the test capability inside the car, and purchasing a population-friendly, high-productivity lab from Group 42 and BGI (based on their own Huo-Yan emergency detection labs in China).
The lab is being built in 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory of this size in the world to operate outside China.
Different methods of testing targeting different parts of the coronavirus' genetic traits have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German equipment manufacturing plan that sends to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own equipment.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was not available until January 28, which delayed testing available in the United States. China and the United States have faced issues regarding the reliability of early-outbreak test teams, and these two countries and Australia have not been able to provide enough numbers to meet demand and follow the testing recommendations made by health experts.
Experts, on the other hand, have stated that the abundance of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for intensified testing programs as the optimal solution to curb the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests being piled up in US private laboratories, and supplies of polls and chemical detectors have been cut.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test equipment.
In the United States, "defects" were found in the test equipment developed by the CDC; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented the test from being carried out in particular. Spain bought test equipment from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to not use the equipment properly.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will withdraw from purchasing equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matevich proposed tossing them into the Danube River. Professor Agnet Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and had been "prohibited from being used". The UK also purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unfit for use.
The tests, followed by a healthy stone for those who were proven infected and those who confused SARS-CoV-2, showed positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which saw Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about 10 days each.
Nearly half of the people whose tests were positive showed no symptoms, and all cases detected were isolated.
As a result of the inter-city movement, the new cases have been completely eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore saw a significant decrease in the prevalence rate compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments; this through strict pattern tracking and restrictions on inbound travel, testing and quarantine.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore had already begun urging residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened on March 23 on schedule after the holidays had ended.
Several other countries have also controlled the pandemic by strictly tracking the routes and imposing restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries that have more tests than the number of deaths have much lower death rates, perhaps because these countries can detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct tests or have local laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send the first five positive and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 accredited labs, there are seven in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "% positive of tests" is influenced by the state's policy in conducting the test.
A country that tests only people who are admitted to hospital will have a higher percentage of positive cases of tests than a country that tests all its population, whether they have symptoms or not, on the basis of the equality of other factors.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is a hand cleaning process for removing dirt, grease, microbes or other unwanted materials.
Constantly washing hands with soap at certain "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, that are transmitted through the oral anthracytoma.
People can also get respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five essential moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important include: before and after urinating, after cleaning the baby's ass or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, poultry and afterwards.
If there is no soap and water, you can wash your hands with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing a baby's diapers or cleaning them after use for the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, or coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, their food, or their waste.
Hand hygiene refers to the health hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before medication or medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it's also an important procedure for individuals.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious diseases that cause diarrhea, and reducing respiratory infections.
And lower infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing practices could lead to slight improvements in the growth of height in children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing minor behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea by nearly a third, which is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the decrease in diarrhea episodes can be related to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and least cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (AREs) when applied to automatic behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the number one cause of death among children under five, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before meals and after toilet use into an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrheal deaths by about half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (water, sanitation and hygiene).
Hand washing also protects against contagion that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor harmful effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can lead to dry skin damage.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that overwashing hands can lead to a skin condition of dandruff and itching known as eczema or skin inflammation, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing is also often seen as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five essential moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral cavity: after using the bathroom (pissing, urinating), after cleaning the baby's ass (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing should be practiced in other cases to prevent disease transmission, including before or after cutting or wounding, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate, estimated at 97 percent, the United States is closer to the average at 77 percent, and China at 23 percent. Many behavior change methods now exist to increase the use of handwashing at times of need.
The "Basic Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education is an example of a broad action to promote children's health and education.
Worm therapy twice a year, along with daily handwashing with soap, and daily flossing of teeth, is central to this national program.
As we have done successfully in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergents to water promotes the removal of germs from the skin.
The main effect of soaps and detergents is to reduce decomposition barriers and increase melting.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because fat and protein, the organic components of soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, the flow of a proper amount of water helps to purify the...
Because of its reusable nature, hard soap can carry bacteria from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transfer is unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still states that "liquid soap is preferable to touchless soap-pumping devices".
Antibacterial soap is highly recommended for health-conscious consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended purifiers or sterilizers is being chosen to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of organisms.
So if the antibacterial soap doesn't affect the antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it's marketed.
Along with a surface tension reducer and skin protection factor, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as an acid regulator and antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (sacs, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that regular soap is as effective as the consumer class antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and spreading to bacteria from the hands.
Hot water for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer is a non-hydraulic hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-hydraulic and vacuum-free alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as handwashes with alcohol or handwashes or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most depend on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compounded with a thickening agent such as a carpomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effectively germ-killing.
Alcoholic strains are used to kill bacteria, drug-resistant multicellular bacteria (methycin-resistant golden cluster spores and vancomycin-resistant intestinal compacts), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory viral infection, nasal, otitis, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcoholic sprays containing 70% alcohol through the pharynx consume 99.97% (logarithmic decrease of 3.5, similar to a decibel decrease of 35) of bacteria on the hands after 30 seconds of placement and 99.99% to 99.999% (logarithmic decrease of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of placement. Hand sprays are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk), the most common cause of infection-induced gastrointestinal infection. Enough hand sanitizer or alcohol rubbing must be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
Rub the front and back of the hands, between all the fingers and the extremities for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with a hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increasing use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating germs; however, they should not be a substitute for washing hands properly unless water and soap are available.
Repeated use of alcoholic hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless you add rainwater or moisturizers or both to the composition.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin, other sprays, or both.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing rainwater cause less irritation and dryness to the skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic tachycardia, tachycardia syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcoholic handwashing products rarely occur.
The lower the risk of inflammation of the irritated contact skin has become an attractive factor compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Although non-hydraulic detergents are effective, they do not work to cleanse hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and composition, and historically, their effect has been significantly less than that of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers that rely on alcohol rubbing.
Recently, compounds that use benzodiazepine chloride have been shown to have an accumulated and persistent effect as an antimicrobial after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to progressive skin reversals.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford to buy soap and use ash or dust instead.
Ash or dust may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dust or ashes are contaminated with germs, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also a purifying agent because it forms a calcium solution when it is in contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The proper hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing pools may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The friction creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and it removes friction for longer periods of time.
Rinse well under running water.
Washing hands inside the basin can re-contaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it to dry in the air.
Wet, wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are ignored are the thumb, wrist, between fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail paint may contain fine objects.
Wet lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands, and dry skin can cause damage, which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water, soap or both are not available, such as pouring water from a suspended vessel or drilling suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supplies (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to water consumption, such as "Tibet pipe" and other low-cost options.
Tipping is a simple technique that uses a rope-tied jar, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is a key part of hand hygiene, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public water systems.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many water cycles.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Towel Industry, to compare the hygiene levels of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and hand dryers with the latest exhaust air.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average by 194 percent on the fingertips and 254 percent on the palms of the hands.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and on the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips dropped by an average of up to 76% and on the palm of the hand by 77%, and scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of infection passing to other users of the water cycle and the water cycle environment as a result of each type of drying method.
A jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and device, and may transmit infection to other water cycle users and the water cycle environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
Using a hot air dryer spreads microorganisms 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after the hands were dried:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers are powered by paper towels.
Handwashing with hand sanitizer is an alternative when traveling due to lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became compulsory for a long time after the Hungarian physician Agnatus Simmelvis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that record hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that using it reduced the incidence of infection.
Wash your hands for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap, water or jelly to make foam and rub each part of your hands.
You have to rub your hands together and your fingers together.
If there is debris under the fingernails, a rough hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water on your hands, it's important to clean them and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare setting is to remove germs and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing is still unacceptable in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to wash their hands routinely before touching patients, transporting germs.
One study showed that washing hands properly and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization published a paper explaining how to wash hands and how to wash them in healthcare sectors.
A draft hand sanitization document provided by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others did a relevant review.
Businesses can measure and verify hand hygiene if they need to demonstrate compliance with regulatory rules.
The World Health Organization has five minutes to wash your hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before the sterilization mission, and
After patient care. The addition of purified chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antibacterial") adds a disinfectant to the handwashing agent.
This exterminator may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic resistant organisms are widely distributed. When someone "screws" their hands for surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching their hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry their hands after washing, sterile screw brushes, and other sterile tools for cleaning under the nails are required.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and aids up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
Long time frills (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from boiling from the hands.
After washing your hands, dry your hands with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
To control the infection of the clot in hospitals, the biggest benefit of hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and it gained a very small additional benefit when hand cleaning frequency increased to over 35%.
Comparing hand rubbing with an alcohol-like solution to hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds was found that alcohol rubbing reduces bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than alcohol handwashing to reduce influenza H1N1 type A virus and severe hand hygiene. Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating staff about handwashing, increasing availability of alcohol handwashing, and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is a cost-effective tool for good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to reach general handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps are rarely found near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building handwashing plants.
However, low handwashing rates can be due to inherent habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap and advocating it in policy decisions can affect, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term population change.
To make this work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower-middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "three-star approach" designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can eventually move from one star to three stars.
Handwashing stations can be part of handwashing campaigns that reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that try to achieve behavior change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an expression code for handwashing.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries and its relationship to age adjusted for disability.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of handwashing for human health was first recognized - especially for people who are going through critical conditions such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Agnates Simmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Englishman Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing".
Most people at the time still thought the infection was caused by the foul odors called meazama.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-care-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "The Right Ways to Wash Your Hands" were hung next to handwashing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "wash your hands of" means an announcement that you don't want to take responsibility for something or be complicit in it.
It originates from a passage in the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, but it has become a much broader phrase in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs Macbeth begins to wash her hands excessively in an attempt to clear a fictional spot that represents her guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes that her husband was incited to commit.
It was also found that people, after pointing out or thinking about immoral actions, tend to wash their hands more than others, and tend to appreciate handwashing tools more.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other "cleansing" compensation procedures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without the presence of hand washing soap, is part of hand washing rituals that have appeared in many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu, Teflá, hand washing in Judaism, washing in Christianity, and lighting in Islam. Religions also impose the washing of clean hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after every meal.
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace are the application of occupational safety and health procedures for risk controls to prevent the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Proper controls for workplace risk management are based on workplace and job function, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in society, and the risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be at risk of COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), businesses with minimal exposure risks involve contact with the public and other co-workers, a situation in which it is recommended to apply basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing coughing and sneezing customs, and maintaining common practices for cleaning and cleaning the work environment.
Medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected individuals who have been infected with COVID-19, but may become infected by ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have been in contact with the general public as in schools, work environments with high work density, and some large retail outlets.
Risk controls for this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, blocks to prevent odor, and the use of personal protective equipment available in case of dealing with someone infected with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers that healthcare workers and the repository of dead bodies who are exposed to or suspected of COVID-19 are exposed to high levels of exposure risk, which increases the risk of exposure if workers are taking over the air pollution generation procedures, or collecting samples from or handling a known or suspected COVID-19 infection.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of exposure.
Business patterns may vary, both in terms of the quality of goods required and the ways to obtain them (such as shopping outside peak hours, via delivery services or without leaving the car).
Finally, cargo shipments from geographically severely affected areas of COVID-19 may be halted. The infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the risk levels associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community places, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also sets out the controls necessary to address those risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The outbreak response goals include reducing infection transmission between employees, protecting people most at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in a business community affects responses.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to classify risk controls by effectiveness.
Since the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution in terms of implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policy or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and management controls, but it can help prevent some exposure sites.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected based on the risk to the worker, the correct fit as necessary (such as respirators), continuous and correct wear, regular inspection, maintenance and replacement, as necessary, removal, cleaning, storage, or correct disposal to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that involve less risk involve minimal contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic measures for infection prevention recommended for all workplaces include washing hands frequently and thoroughly, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and thirst customs including mouth and nose coverings when coughing and thirsting, providing paper towels and garbage containers, preparing to work remotely or alternately if necessary, dissuading workers from using other tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and cleaning of the work environment.
Immediate identification of individuals who are likely to be infected and isolation is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms stay home until fever, fever and other symptoms disappear for at least 24 hours without using anti-fever or other symptoms-improving medications, that sick leave policies be flexible, that employees be allowed to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, jobs with a moderate exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19, but may become SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing infection transmission in the workplace community, or because a person has recently made an international trip to a COVID-19 infection site.
The engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include installing efficient air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic thunderstorms, installing windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the car. The management controls for these and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to show up at home, replacing the social networks with a range of cleaner access, establishing unlimited work schedules, and setting up a non-developmental framework for the needs of the individual, including the needs of the employee, the needs of the employee, the needs of the employee, the risks of the employee, the use of the equipment, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, the risks of the employee, and the risks of the employee, and the risks of the risks of the employee.
Rarely do workers in this risk group need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on board, appropriate prevention controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the sick passenger at a distance of 6 feet from others, assigning one crew member to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or thirsting.
The crew must wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biological hazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. For commercial cargo, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include postponing travel when sick, self-isolation and immediate notification to the medical center on board if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the ideal situation, medical follow-up should be done in the isolation ward. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or cleansing if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of the spread in the community.
When there is a limit to the transmission of infection in the community ranging from limited to moderate, social distancing strategies such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes or band classes or eating at the bomb shelter can be implemented, increasing office distances, organizing successive attendance and departure times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health desk for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a large transmission of infection in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the length of school leaving dates can be taken into account. For law enforcement personnel who perform routine daily activities, direct health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who should contact individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as medical emergency services, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during detention, workers should clean and clean work belts and tools before reusing them with a household spray or cleaning wiper, follow uniform work procedures to deal with contamination, dispose of used personal protective equipment, collect and wash clothes.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers that some healthcare workers and the body repository fall into categories with high or very high risk levels.
High-risk jobs include those who provide healthcare, support, treatment and transportation services to patients known or suspected of having COVID-19.
This becomes a very high risk level if workers perform airborne waste generation procedures, as well as collect samples from patients confirmed or suspected of having or dealing with COVID-19.
Airborne waste generating procedures include piping, cough induction procedures, rectal examinations, certain dental procedures and tests, or the collection of a tooth sample.
Functions of the high-risk coroner portfolio include staff involved in preparing the bodies of people confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death; those with an extremely high risk level become exposed if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these at-risk groups include isolation rooms for patients known or suspected of having COVID-19, including when performing airborne vapour generation procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare facilities and for the preservation of the dead.
Samples must be handled with Tier 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating patients arriving in separate waiting areas based on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those performing air pollution generation procedures.
In the United States, respirators with face masks with a N95 type filter, approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or better, should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation and fitness testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve workers' comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend using respirators, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends that surgical masks only be used for screening staff at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, take care of them, or transport them without any airborne vaginal delivery procedures, the World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks, protective glasses, face masks, and gloves.
If airborne vacuum generation is performed, the face mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through remote medicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the personal protective equipment needed for the specific task, and continuing to use the same breathing mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis and monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, while using the masks for individuals who do not show symptoms.

We found ourselves in the midst of extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a stark demonstration of global human connectivity and the responsibilities we have to others.
Our history has never seen such challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on a kind of global compassion, cooperation and community building, which are the building blocks of this organization.
The intense friendship and care we have experienced among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable practical demonstration of the amazing human emotions that surround, fortunately, the way we do business.
I feel deeply grateful and deeply proud that you are true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a note expressing their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of the enormous importance of the world's ability to move toward Wikipedia right now, and the symbolic power that this vital resource has to remain online and accessible to all individuals.
Your efforts have made this possible, whether it's by continuing to operate websites, getting our colleagues paid, or providing security for our communities.
The world is in greater need of the information available on Wikipedia than ever.
It's a moment where the positive impact on the world is not just on our efforts, but also on the way we do it.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role, we're going to make major changes to how we work together starting next week.
Changes to working methods and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C team met yesterday to discuss our method and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we saw could be the appropriate response to what we were facing, and the perfect way to keep the business going during this period.
We wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce the burden and tasks, that's fine.
For all workers, contractors and contractors:
The expected daily work time is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a vacation, so if you can work longer than usual, you might add to the task.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries, or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We're not following your timeline.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should be understood to be allowed to go unspoken, but we're calling it a statement.
No sick leave or paid leave is required, you should simply inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor has a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, please tell Brian in the Training and Certification Department so that the Training and Certification Department can provide support and ensure that you receive appropriate care from the administration).
The hourly colleagues get their full pay.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
Each employee will receive his or her salary according to normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we're here for you.
Many people are using work to overcome the rampant pressures of the world around us.
What we can do will be incredibly productive, especially during difficult times like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We only ask that you contact your manager so that he can find out what to expect and adjust the procedures accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things we need to keep going.
Reliability site engineering teams, HR operations, trust, honesty, fundraising (and others) are doing a very important job, which may need more support.
We will begin a process of working with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There's a lot of work we all have to do, and we'll just focus on the most important projects.
Going a little slower now won't hurt us later.
We don't plan on doubling down the work schedule to make sense of the past after the pandemic ends.
We're not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept that those circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and timetables when it becomes appropriate.
What happens in the annual planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and daily work hours forecasts, we intend to modify the delivery schedule of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time to budget to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while aligning the situations of those who need to work within a schedule with reduced working hours or want to, over the next few weeks.
This schedule extension eases the current planning workload and the pressure across the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and inform the delegates and teams of the updates regarding the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their pioneering role in this.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
We learned last week that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, starting with the strict precaution and prohibition, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to clean all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team used a virus-resistant solution of the class used in hospitals to clean all the surfaces, as well as the hallways and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its own duty of care protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We're comfortable that the office is now properly set up until we decide to get back to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is in a building owned by Weaver, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with all of our staff at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C. office moved to a completely remote location on the same direction as our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our New York City headquarters know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing, but they may be delayed for a while.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote colleagues know that it could be a change, and they wanted to give you some advice:
The time of meetings should be set at a maximum of one hour or gradually increased to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, you should consider how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly scheduled, an agenda should be prepared and the reading material should be sent in advance.
Video should be made a virtual solution, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
The initiative should facilitate each meeting, with a person monitoring the conversation to find out the questions and follow up the list of speakers, and another person to help write notes (or carry out the process of co-writing notes).
Technical support should be emailed when comfortable headphones are needed.
Health and safety compensation can be used to pay for snacks.
You can join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed business.
The HR team is looking for user-friendly guidance based on online meetings, to support the growth of business distributed through our organization.
Last week, we asked all community grants recipients to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the Editathon webinar until the World Health Organization declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions would make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities, and that no fines would be imposed on anyone because of the need to delay or modify those goals.
Next week we'll be releasing additional follow-up guidance on Wikimedia and other regional community and thematic conferences.
The general emotions that dominate the global community are intertwined between grief over disorder, and comfort over clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and others.
In light of the progress in these procedures, the crisis response team is working on designing a MetaWiki page to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up on all contacts.
Stay up to date on COVID-19-related topics
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific time for the working group meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional news, answer questions, and spend time communicating with each other.
We're going through this together and we're always ready to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, we can continue to get information from this email, and all the other necessary COVID-19 information available at Wiki's office.
The crisis response team will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with workers living in severely affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, major business areas, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to inform us and cooperate with the crisis response team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have a sensitive or confidential issue, please email Brian Goodin, Global Human Resources Manager.
Any change in these changes may not be considered as a departure from our work or obligations.
Instead, it's a realization in this present moment that our work and our commitments are in dire need of adapting to situations in a way we haven't had in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work and provide our workers with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work we've planned will be waiting for us when it's time to do it.
Now, it's time for everyone to lend a helping hand and create space for the important work that's coming in the coming weeks and months.
We all need you to achieve this, and that's why we all need you to take care of yourself and your families to be at your best when your time of need is over.
Please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, Director of Crisis Response Team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jimmy V, Jenin U, Lisa S, Robin E, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is linked to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 counteracts the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an input for some types of coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a metallic enzyme that contains the element zinc and is located on the surface of membranes and other cells.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme protein 2 contains the peptide M2 domain with an amino acid, and the carboxyl-terminal colectrain chain is a carrier of renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type 1 monocylindric membrane protein, with active enzyme receptors found on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The outer part of the cell's angio-tensin 2 transducer is separated from the membrane by an enzyme called shidaz, which results in a soluble protein being released into the bloodstream and then excreted through the urine.
The angiotensin-2 transducer is found in most organs: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 synaptic cells in the lung, in the gut cells of the small intestine, in the lining cells of the arteries and veins, and in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
The messenger RNA of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is found in the cortex, the spinal cord, the subclavian region, and the brain stem.
The primary function of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is to act as a balancer for angiotensin-converting enzyme.
The angiotensin-transforming enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin-1 to angiotensin-2 that binds blood vessels.
In contrast, the angiotensin-2 transducer isolates the carboxylic end of the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin-2 (aspartite-arginine-valine-thyrocin-isoliosin-hestidine-proline-phenylalanine) and converts it into angiotensin (1-7), (hestidine-aspartite-arginine-valine-thyrocin-isoliosin-hestidine-proline-phenylalanine).
The angiotensin-2 transducer is broken down into a number of other peptides including [des-arginine9] - bradricinine, aplenine, neurotensin, denorphine A, and gerlin.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 also regulates the membrane passage of the neutral carrier of the amino acid parity SLC6A19, and has a role in Hartnob disease.
The angiotensin-transferase 2 enzyme, as a membrane-containing protein, is the main entry point into cells of some coronaviruses, which include the human coronaviruses NL63, SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19 disease).
Specifically, the Spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 binds to the enzyme range of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on the cell surface to cell repair and the virus and enzyme transfer to the inner particles located in the cells.
This insertion process requires the preparation of S protein by the membrane protease enzyme, serine2, of the host, which is still being tested as a potential treatment. This makes some believe that lowering the levels of the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme in cells may help resist infection.
However, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend that you continue to use the usual angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A methodological study and telemarketing analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a marked 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to the reference group".
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was lower among patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a decrease in the mortality rate from pneumonia, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lung injuries, and has been found to improve pulmonary blood distribution, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by high fat sugars.
The half-life of the angiotensin-2 transducer is about 10 hours, while it begins to work after 30 minutes, and its activity (time period) continues up to 24 hours.
There is considerable evidence that the compliant angiotensin-2 transcriptase may be a promising treatment for patients with intolerance to traditional resonance angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and in diseases accompanied by high blood angiotensin-2 levels. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the effect of the compliant angiotensin-2 transcriptase injection on the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile application software apps specifically designed to help track people who are infected in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people ("the infected") who may have been infected with an infection.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some jurisdictions and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been put in place to design applications to track bugs.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, especially about systems that rely on geolocation tracking for app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record nearby user from other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced together that they have integrated a feature that supports these Bluetooth-based applications, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have confused people with COVID-19.
It's an app that people use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, people use an app called TraceTogether.
A local information technology association has taken over the design of the app, and released it as an open source app and is scheduled to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched the!StopKorona app, an application based on the use of Bluetooth to track exposure to the mix of individuals with potential injuries and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology has taken over the design of the application in cooperation with the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting approval of the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the malware tracking app was in advanced development and could become available for distribution in weeks. Ireland and France plan to launch a similar app, called StopCovid.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering designing apps based on the TraceTogether app launched by Singapore, as well as the Blue Tris protocol. Russia is proposing an app that uses the geographic virtual environment for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by doctors from residents of Moscow, and is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and a potential lack of effectiveness if the use of applications is limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that could add their own coronavirus-related apps to its app store; it limited this to only "official" or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of collective surveillance resulting from the use of coronavirus apps, particularly as to whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
The surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and surveillance extensions should include provisions relating to the timing of their suspension;
The use of data should be limited to purposes related to COVID-19;
The security of data and the confidentiality of its owners should be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be determined by law;
Protection against abuse and protection of citizens' rights should be provided to address abuse;
"Effective participation" is required from all "stakeholders concerned", including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also released review lists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing monitoring problem by removing tracking mechanism from device operating systems once it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based site tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download apps and allowing tracking to be avoided.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to the primary data of sites involve potentially large privacy issues.
However, not all central server systems need access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems are created that use central servers for intercommunications only (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-app-based system to conduct rogue tracking operations.
Instead of using a custom app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and incorporates this data to send text messages to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential miscreants, the government has also made the location information publicly available, which it has allowed because of the wide-ranging changes in information privacy laws that have occurred after the coronavirus outbreak that causes the Middle East respiratory syndrome in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, have looked at the use of both centralized and privacy systems.
On April 6, 2020, details about this have not yet been released.
Privacy-conserving mixtures follow a consistent and successful concept and are supported by strong research papers dating back to at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to come up with privacy-compliant solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (PLE) to record near-user from other cell phones.
However, BEPB-PT was a coordinated effort that contained both centralized and decentralized approaches, not individual protocols. Decentralized protocols include privacy-protected decentralized approach tracking (DB-PBT/DB-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols, and mobile device error tracking (BACT) mechanisms.
In these protocols, the ID data does not leave the device, and all matching processes occur on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab was developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy technologies when collecting location data or cross-tracks and leveraging them to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research from the March 2020 report "Applications' Face: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Shadow of the Pandemic", SafeTrace's platform is another similar effort from Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company that also originally originated at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with users and other officials without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, a Global Contact Tracking Coalition was established by groups focused on what was basically a similar approach and highly overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing distraction and enabling global interchangeability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature of achieving widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the Blue Tris Protocol, which is used by the official government application, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced a bug tracking initiative; they claimed they would maintain privacy by combining low-power Bluetooth technology with privacy-preserved encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to put the system in three stages, namely:
We're introducing tools to enable governments to create official privacy apps to track the coronavirus.
This feature is integrated directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to solve the ongoing usage and monitoring issues by distributing systems first through operating system updates and then by removing them the same way as soon as the threat is over.
Drug reuse (also known as reuse, re-allocation, or target change or treatment change of a drug) is the re-definition of the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than was originally designed for its treatment.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently using to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfer of the subcutaneous. The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which contains multiple ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these linked sites provides a reasonable plan for developing an effective antiviral drug that destroys COVID-19 proteins.
Among the proteins targeted for SARS-CoV-2 are papine-like protease, ribose-dependent DNA polymerase, helix, S protein, and adenosine-diphosphate ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A.A., and others studied several candidate compounds that were then refined and analyzed to resemble more similarly-approved drugs, with the aim of accelerating the development of a potent anti-SARSCoV-2 drug in his preclinical study to recommend it in the design of a clinical study.
Chlorine is a malaria medicine that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chlorine and its related chlorine hydroxide could be among four drugs under study as part of a clinical solidarity experiment.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that New York State trials on chlorine and hydroxy chlorine may begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA issued a certificate of emergency use (AU) using hydroxy chlorine sulphites and chlorine phosphates.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA through clinical trials and is licensed under an emergency use license only as an emergency use trial treatment for patients who have been admitted to hospital but cannot get treatment in the clinical trial.
The CDC has announced that it has not yet determined "the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, its treatment, dosage or duration".
Doctors said they use the drug when "there's no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Big studies are taking place at Duke University and Oxford University.
New York University Langon School of Medicine is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Favivir was "clearly effective".
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative for an average of 4 days, while the incidence of illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given favivir and the other half were given omefinovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has warned people that the evidence supporting the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan to add to its reserve, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has held preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in treating more severe cases where the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to get pregnant.
One study using Lupinavir/Retonavir (Calitra), a combination of the antiviral compounds Lupinavir and Retonavir, reported that the results "found no benefit".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV from copying with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to reach a compound linked to the SARS-CoV-2 protease, and the scientific community has seen a state of criticism about redirecting resources to the purpose of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has added Lupinavir/Retonavir to the international solidarity experiment.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in the laboratory against several viral, mucous and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is to develop resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one is for moderate-to-severe patients, and the other is for more severe-to-severe patients.
There are three clinical trials on vitamin C antiviral on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 illness, as well as two controlled trials using fake medicine (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial in Italy.
New York State began trials on the effects of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial on the use of Teijin-produced alvesco (cyclosonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, to treat patients with novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A phase 2 trial using a form of an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is currently being conducted on 200 patients required to join the trial of acute hospitalization in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, which is called Colcorona, included 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without having to be hospitalized.
Pregnant or nursing women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight hybarin is currently widely used to treat patients, requiring the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines for its use.
A multi-center study in Italy of 300 patients to investigate the use of sodium inoxabarin in disease prevention and therapeutic doses was announced on April 14.
Because of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, scientific attention has been focused on reusing approved antiviral drugs designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as the Mars virus, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Repavirin: Repavirin is recommended by specialists for COVID-19 treatment according to version 7 of the Chinese guidelines.
Omfinofer: According to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines, experts recommend using Omfinofer for the treatment of COVID-19.
Some antibiotics that experts have identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments include:
Tosilizumab (interleukin receptor 6) approved in China.
Experiments in Italy and China also. See also Tosilizumab #COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, there are many attempts underway to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes it, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccines candidates in the first phase of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity for vaccine development.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition Initiative for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations for vaccine development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread deployment and global reach.
In April, coalition scientists involved in pandemic preparedness innovations reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform which has progressed to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (oxygen-deficient riboside DNA and riboside DNA) (first stage developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, and mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (developer of the first stage and vaccine candidate: Moderna, and type 5 gastroenteritis carrier)
According to coalition scientists concerned with pandemic preparedness innovations in April, there are a total of 115 vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more announced, but with little public information available (supposedly in the planning or design phase).
The first and second phase trials are an initial safety and immunity test, usually randomized, and controlled by randomization, at multiple sites, with more accurate and effective doses determined.
Phase 3 trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including the reference group, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, with the negative effects of the optimal dose monitored.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under "preclinical" research).
On approximately January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular adhesive vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune response.
On approximately January 24, 2020 in Canada, the Vido-InterVac International Centre at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
The vaccine development projects at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention were announced on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On or about January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, led by Haneke Schweitzer, announced that they had started work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with her biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, OncoGen Lab in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with a similar technology to that used in cancer treatment with a novel anti-cancer vaccine.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and that they were starting to conduct tests.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had started a vaccine project to create the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Equipment Command at Fort Derek and Walter Reed Military Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On approximately March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had formed a team with Novavax Inc.
In developing and manufacturing a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even with the pace of work accelerating it would take at least a year and a half to about two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it had developed a coronavirus-like particle partially funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with plans for human testing in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which was required by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to participate in the development of a vaccine based on the transcriptional RNA.
The candidate RNA-based vaccine, BNT162, is currently undergoing preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will receive preclinical test results in April 2020 and the final candidate vaccine could begin human trials by autumn.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, driving the total investment of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
Coalition partners involved in the COVID-19 vaccine development pandemic preparedness innovations are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing for six different filtered vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplified riboside nucleic acid vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of 275 million Canadian dollars for 96 research projects on COVID-19 medical measures, including several vaccines that are being nominated in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced Canadian $192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national vaccine bank of several new vaccines that can be used in the event of another outbreak of the coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "Sars-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines given with a microscopic needle triggered strong responses to antibody-specific antibodies [in mice] that were evident starting 2 weeks after vaccination".
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-deficient ribose-based filter vaccine as a potential nasal spray.
Using the anesthesia, the depleted riboside DNA will design oxygen to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM's giant computers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have altered effects, also called undesirable effects.
That means it can have benefits beyond the disease you're fighting.
Another random experiment in Australia seeks to register 4,170 healthcare workers.
Current vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as genetically modified mice with the angiotensin-2 enzyme, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for Tier 3 biosecurity containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against MERS.
When Mars spread, it was believed that research based on SARS could provide a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against Mars-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one vaccine for MERS (based on the DNA-deficient ribose) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines in development, all of which were virus-targeted vaccines, two Gastroenteric Virus-targeted vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, and BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-targeted vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have sparked a conspiracy theory that claims that the virus that causes COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in many social media publications refer to existing patents for gene sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-causing coronaviruses.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is now caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with the acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported injured in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during mixing, often through the spraying of coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When the spray is spread during the sponge process, it usually falls to the ground or on the surface rather than being contagious over distances.
People can also get infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on rooftops for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious in the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it may spread before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the interaction of the reverse-current polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) through a nasal swab.
Masks are recommended for those suspected of being infected and those dependent on them.
The general recommendations for people to wear masks vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some say otherwise, and others mandate their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment specific to COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not have symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is recommended if there are emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, pain or pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking up, or blurring of the face or lips.
In less common cases, symptoms of the upper respiratory system such as nausea, runny nose or throat may be observed.
Symptoms of the digestive system, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, have been observed in varying proportions.
At first, some cases in China suffered from chest tightness and only claws.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
It's called the nursery period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of disease carriers without symptoms in the transmission of infection has not yet been fully identified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may have contributed to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people who are infected without symptoms is currently unknown and are under study, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases showed no symptoms during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began listing cases with no symptoms in the daily count on April 1st; out of 166 cases that day, there were 130 (78%) of these cases with no symptoms when tested.
Bulldogs and games can carry large amounts of the virus.
It's more of a sparkling sound than a normal speech.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering the mouth can cause spraying to spread to a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted through air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted through bioavailability, and examination of samples from air collectors in the lobby outside individual rooms has yielded positive results for viral riboside DNA.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary prevention and rehabilitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray, and the virus can then spread through the air.
Although there are fears that it may spread through feces, it is believed that the risk is limited. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although there is some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can generally infect two to three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to remain present for one day on paper, up to three days on plastic (polyprotein) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective provided used properly; soap dissolves the virus's protective adipose layer and stops it from working, as well as cleansing the skin and other surfaces of the virus.
Other solutions, such as benzodiazepine chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are available, with lower efficacy. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospital transport.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test, the sixth patient had the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus associated with severe respiratory syndrome, where three people with pneumonia were isolated for the first time in Wuhan's group of cases of severe respiratory disease.
The new SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, the household soap destroys the virus, destroying its immune membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant of the type 2 synaptic cells found in the lung.
The virus uses a special superficial sugar protein called Spike to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of the infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, had a severe heart attack, more common in critical cases.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and are involved in its function.
The incidence of clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 increased, which may be linked to a doubling of predictability of what the disease will lead to.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is directed toward the ECE2 expressed spinal cells in the respiratory system, severe COVID-19 patients suffer from symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that secrete disease-causing GMCSF have been shown to be linked to the single cell release of inflammatory interleukin-6 and inflammatory lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
I'm also reported to have a spinal cord injury at autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several protocols for testing the disease.
The RRT-PCR polymerase chain reaction is the standard test method.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a sample with a mine can also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require taking two weeks' difference in blood and the results are straightforward.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of the coronavirus and spread the gene sequencing so that labs around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were being developed, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese test experiment showed that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical point of care test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the Chungnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The double-sided multi-slit stained glass windows with an irregular peripheral and backward spread are common early in injury.
The spread underneath the side may appear as a stone rise (thickness of the pituitary gland with an uneven sinus filling) and merge with the progression of the disease.
There is little data available on the pathogenic microbiology and physiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological conclusions of autopsy:
Microscopy: bronchitis, pneumonia, swelling of the lungs and pneumonia
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, hypertension of the lung cells, large, non-specific synaptic cells, and vaginal inflammation with a buildup of lymph nodes and the formation of giant multi-nuclear cells.
Acute pneumonia: A widespread DAD damage with widespread synchronous secretions.
The widespread sinus damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute blood oxygen deficiency.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in the sinus cavity and pulmonary embolism
Blood: diffuse blood clotting within the vessels (DIC); white blood cell interaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of injury include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a bandage when coughing or sneezing, and it is recommended to use the inside of the bandage if a bandage is not available.
It is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended using cloth face masks in public places, partly to reduce transmission of infection to those without symptoms. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distance guidelines also include people being at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no known drug for its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19. Given that no vaccine is expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "flattening the curve".
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are clearly dirty, before eating, after cleaning their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not only available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two ingredients for domestic production.
The antimicrobial activity is generated in these two compounds from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial defects in alcohol; it is "not an effective hand sanitizer".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that anyone suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Oxygen is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene, reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may help those who have mild symptoms during the early stages of infection. The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for caring for those who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19.
Intensive care and pulmonary care professionals in the United States have collected treatment recommendations from a variety of bodies in a free resource, a critical care book available online.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some doctors recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as a first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when carrying out spraying procedures, such as vaccination or manual breathing.
For healthcare professionals who care for COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) as well as standard precautions, mixing precautions and airborne disease precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended devices: Personal protective equipment buttons, respirator or face mask, eyewear, medical gloves. If available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators were adopted for industrial facilities, but the FDA authorized the use of masks under the EIA.
They are designed to protect against airborne molecules like dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain if used for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends using face masks, or homemade masks, as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 cases are not so bad that they require artificial or alternative respiration, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for those in hospitals is actively studied, with some evidence that it is possible to avoid the injection using high-flow nasal passage or positive bi-level airflow pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options will benefit those with a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive industrial respiration whenever available because this technique limits the spread of vacuum particles compared to high-flow nasal cavities. Critical cases are more common among older adults (over 60, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for the population, limiting the health system's ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of dangerous COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed industrial respiratory support, and 1.4% of cases died.
In China, about 30% of those who are admitted to hospitals because of COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.
Industrial respiration becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
The respiratory system must have high-pressure control and ultra-positive sphygmomania to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory and chest lung injury.
High positive endopharyngeal pressure may not be available in older respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesphere seems to be the most gospel-oriented.
Although it may take until 2021 for new drugs to develop, many drugs undergoing testing have already been approved for other uses or are already in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested on people with a critical medical condition.
The World Health Organization recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted a temporary license to use hygienic plasma as a trial treatment in cases where a person's life is threatened seriously or directly.
It has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove it is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect 'mismatches' using surveillance data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential danger is detected, the app not only recommends self-cleaning stone, but also alerts local health officials. It uses big data analytics of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence to track infected and mixed people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security services to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus infections.
The measure is taken to impose sanity and protect those who may be interfering with injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the collected phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition to detect stones.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Julio Galleria, said that mobile phone companies told him that "40% of people are still moving everywhere".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend, which attracted more than 42,000 people.
The President of Estonia, Kirsty Kalilaide, has also made a global appeal to showcase innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel upset because of a health problem, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
The BBC published a statement to Rory O'Connor: "The increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are a major storm that is damaging people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may take a mild course with mild or no symptoms, similar to other common diseases of the upper respiratory system such as colds.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to get severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data on COVID-19, and COVID-19 can affect the lungs in some people by causing pneumonia.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, traumatic brain injury or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include intravenous, abnormal blood clots, heart, kidney, and liver damage.
6% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital were diagnosed with anemia, specifically increased prothrombin time, while 4% had kidney dysfunction.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated levels of liver enzymes (amino transporters).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in the hospital.
However, the average time for those transferred to the ICU between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In an early case study, the average period from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and overall cases ranged from six days to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission, the male mortality rate was 2.8 percent, while the female mortality rate was 1.7 percent.
Patient tissue anatomy tests of lung samples after death show widespread synchronous damage with cellular fibromycin secretions in both lungs.
Changes in viral cell proliferation have been observed in the stem cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage from high levels of thrombin or heart attack was found in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those admitted to the hospital had previously had a medical condition. Availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic status of the region could also affect the mortality rate.
Estimates of deaths from the condition vary due to these differences between regions, but also due to systemic difficulties.
The reduced limitation of simple cases may lead to higher estimates of mortality than the truth.
However, the fact that previous injury causes deaths may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer from severe symptoms of COVID-19, 2.4 times more likely to die than non-smokers, and concerns have been raised about long-term complications of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority revealed a 20 to 30 percent reduction in lung capacity in some recovering patients, and lung tests indicated damage.
It can also cause post-concentration syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections gained those recovering from the disease effective and long-term immunity.
The acquisition of immunity is considered a possibility, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported to have recovered from COVID-19 and then later re-infected.
He believes these cases get worse if the infection continues longer than it does when it repeats.
He thinks the virus is natural and has animal origin, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely a result of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date for symptoms to appear.
Official publications from the World Health Organization reported that December 8, 2019 is the first date for symptoms.
Many procedures are usually taken to determine the death toll.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time it takes since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender and public health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization, under the 10th revision of the International Classification of Emergency Diseases, allocated U 07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U 07.2 for COVID-19 COVID-19 deaths diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory-confirmed virus infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the worldwide fatality rate from injury was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of those who were diagnosed and died from disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of those who were diagnosed and who were not diagnosed and who died from disease.
These statistics don't have a time frame, they track a specific population from the time of the infection to the time of the fate.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected people, their presence may provide information about the number of infected.
At the center of Italy's outbreak, Castilloni di Ada, a small village of 4,600 people, has already killed 80 people (1.7 percent).
In Junglet, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and spread to young people, causing a relatively low mortality rate, and perhaps not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified as a result.
Moreover, the German health system has not been dismantled.
In the Netherlands, I probably have about 3% antibodies, according to a blood donor fee assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate resulting from it differ between men and women.
The mortality rate for men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is at age 50, with the gap between men and women narrowing only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, the low prevalence of smoking among women and the simultaneous disease of men, such as high blood pressure, may have contributed to higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track gender-based data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
The proportion of health workers, especially nurses, is higher than women, and they are at increased risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "Covid-19".
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Jibrisos explained that Co, short for Corona, and Virus W, short for Disease W, 19 refer to the year the outbreak was first discovered: December 31, 2019.
Choose the name to avoid referring to a specific geographic location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with international labeling recommendations aimed at preventing staining. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus.
In addition, the WHO uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public data.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as the Corona virus.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended using the 2019 novel coronavirus and the 2019 novel coronavirus-related acute respiratory illness aliases as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines prohibiting the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The two official titles covid-19 and sarcov-2 were released on 11 february 2020.
Because of the limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital manufacturers are exporting healthcare products like nose scanners and respiratory parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier could not deliver it in time, a local startup reversed its engineering and released the 100 required valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
It seems humans are capable of transmitting the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus multiplying in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines for treating the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the Solidarity Experiment to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the best promising efficacy.
No vaccine is available, but various bodies are actively developing filtered vaccines.
It's leveraged previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 because it's similar to SARS-CoV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being studied.
First, the researchers aim to develop a full vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether dead or inactive, is intended to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, the molecular vaccine, is to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain molecular modules of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on a Spike S protein that helps the virus break into ACE2 enzymes.
The third strategy is in DNA vaccines (colonic or riboside DNA vaccines, a new technique for vaccine development).
Trial vaccines produced by any of these strategies must be tested to ensure their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an unharmed, outdated genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been cited as a potential challenge facing the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this is contradictory.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven approved therapies for malaria have already been tested, including four studies involving hydroxychloroquine or chlorokine.
The proposed antiviral drugs to be reused in the treatment of the new disease make up most of China's research, with nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir across several countries scheduled to report results by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs as of April 2020 was conducted. Several antiviral drugs available for COVID-19 treatment are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chlorokine, hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/retonavir and lupinavir/etonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is preliminary evidence of Remdesivir's effectiveness, as of March 2020.
My bed improvement has been observed in patients treated with Remdesivir for the use of eczema.
Phase 3 clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorokine, formerly used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and has initial results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorine.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Virological Research suggests that although a dose of one gram is recommended, a weak dose is extremely dangerous and can cause death.
On 28 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use license for chloroquine hydroxy and chloroquine according to the estimate of doctors treating people with COVID-19. Version 7 of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or omefinofer for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Initial data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the lab.
Further study of the effect of nitasoxandide on organisms was recommended after it was shown to inhibit the low concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial preparation of protein Spike by membrane-transfering serine protease 2 (TMPRS2) is necessary for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant shortcomings that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory and has no known role in treating COVID-19.
The cytokine storm may be one of the complications of the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydrochloride may have anti-sitokinetic properties. The National Health Commission of China added to the guidelines for treatment after completing a small study.
It is subjected to a random stage 2 test at national level in Italy after showing positive results in patients with severe conditions.
In addition to being used in serum ferritin testing to identify cytokine storms, it is aimed at countering such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some patients.
The FDA approved Interleukin-6 receptor therapy, a receptor T-cell therapy for an anti-chemical, based on case studies of relapse to treat cytokine secretion syndrome in non-reactive steroidal patients with a different cause in 2017.
So far, there is no rigorous, disciplined evidence that tosilezumab is an effective treatment for cytokine secretion syndrome.
The purified, concentrated antibody transfer method produced by COVID-19 immunosuppressants is being studied by those who need it as a non-vaccine method of negative vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and the results were inconclusive.
Viral neutralization represents the expected mechanism of action through which negative antibody therapy can act as a defense agent against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cellular toxicity based on antibodies, saliva, or both may be used.
Other forms of antibody-adverse treatment, such as the use of single-generation antibodies, are in development.
The production of the serum of the infected, which consists of the liquid part of the recovered patients' blood and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased to spread faster.
Coronaviruses, a group of closely related syndromes.
Lee Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
