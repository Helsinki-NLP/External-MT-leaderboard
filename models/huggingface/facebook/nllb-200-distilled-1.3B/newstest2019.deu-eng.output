DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil to come back
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel does not see any basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team at the moment.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on getting in the conversation, on talking to him about why he felt the way he did in his statement", Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrase Cutter" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite months of debate over the pictures of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have liked to have seen Mesut Özil continue to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case up to a certain point", Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had announced his resignation from the DFB team in July, also justifying it by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist animosities during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He said he didn't want to put pressure on the players, but he knows from football that when you leave a team or change clubs, you talk to your coach about it and I think it's a shame that that conversation hasn't happened yet.
Linz: A garden hut in the Schrebergarten district burned
At 14.13 hours, the professional fire brigade in Linz was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in the past.
The professional fire department went out and found the cabin on fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed virtually entirely and the necessary amount of fire debris removed.
According to the owner of the burning garden shed, he had a battery plugged into the shop at noon.
That could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the fire department said the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
It must have been considerable, however, since the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Lindsay Lohan attacks a refugee family on the open road
What could have driven Lindsay Lohan to this most bizarre action?
Apparently, she was trying to snatch the children from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial clip of the stream.
Here you see "Kissed for Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan.
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and walking to a possibly homeless family that she claims is a Syrian refugee family.
As the family nearly runs away from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She's accusing the adults of trafficking children.
She's not giving any evidence in the video.
"The whole world is watching right now", Lohan can be heard in the video following the family down the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, though, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
Then, in tears, the actress admits how shocked she is - and holds her tongue.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: this mission has "mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 spacecraft was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It's supposed to get close enough to the asteroid Ryugu to suck material off its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticklers: death toll in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
The earthquake and tsunami that followed in Sulawesi, Indonesia, killed at least 420 people.
The death toll could rise even higher.
Rescue teams have not yet reached the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk is stepping down as Tesla's chairman.
It started with a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused a stir in the stock markets in early August when he announced the electric car maker's withdrawal.
The SEC sued him for fraud, but now they've settled.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is stepping down from the board, but he can stay on as chairman.
The British Conservative Party Congress
The Tories' convention is under heavy guard
Birmingham is becoming the scene of a power struggle.
The party's convention is expected to focus on foreign policy, trade and development, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, led by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new name for the country
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but it is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting over these name spellings for years.
Now they've made a deal.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia and the people will vote on it this Sunday - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" (The one who is not) - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is presenting himself as an anti-system candidate and is leading the polls.
His most bitter rival is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labour Party.
Audi: Dieselgate is taking longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still there", said Peter Mertens, head of development, to the industry magazine Automobilewoche.
The arrested and on leave Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested", he said at the time.
Mr Mertens said: 'At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in the resolution of the diesel crisis.
We've completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Commission has also examined whether the aid measure in question constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" to ensure that such a scandal never happened again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to continue the discussion on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false emission values after the emissions scams became known.
He either knew about the manipulation or he deliberately ignored it.
Currently, sales manager Bram Schot is managing the company as Chief Executive Officer.
The new standard for emissions and consumption tests, WLTP, has led to production downtime at Audi, Schot told the Heilbronner Stimme.
In principle, he sees a declining demand for sedans such as the Audi A6, A7 and A8 models produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult", he said.
Scotland is relying on electric mobility.
The e-tron, Audi's first electric car, has already received 15,000 reservations.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm to DFB presidium
Reinhard Grindel wants to run for president of the German Football Association again next year despite criticism of his personality after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can", Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Aktuelle Sportstudio".
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, and I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "strange" if, after the award for the 2024 European Championship, he did not "have the desire to work on the future project".
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the Sommermärchen affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB presidium, according to Grindel.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he will continue to be a member of the Bureau in this role and then, of course, he will be warmly invited to contribute his experience on sporting issues", said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation about whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, the office is held by Cacau and Celia Sasic, both Brazilian nationals, the latter with family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background clearly intervenes in society and football and says 'this is an important issue, we need to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration needs to work", Grindel said.
Weight Loss With a Semi-Smart Scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates body mass index, but that's more for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about me replacing fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: clear opening game results for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match for over 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the leading scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national team player Johannes Thiemann (18 goals) also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators in his debut in the national team.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won at the official debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the leading scorer with 24 points.
The professional from Würzburg, Gabriel Olaseni, came in at 14 points.
Last year's playoff semifinalist MHP Giesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners of Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
Newcomer Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter on the team under coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
The basketball Lions Braunschweig had a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
New quarterback Will Cummings led the Oldenburg with 25 points.
The Bruins, who have had NBA star Dennis Schröder as majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the baskets quickly cleared the balance.
Erdogan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdogan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gulen supporters living in Germany and to crack down on Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow PKK or Gülen sympathizers to upset our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship", he said.
The opening of the Ditib Mosque had partially closed down the Cologne city centre.
Several thousand policemen were on duty - including snipers.
The Islamist Association Ditib is under criticism because it is considered an extension of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: stars, boos and a moment of terror
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been promoting more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can", Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of some 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here. This is a dream.
Cardi B was performing in a red outfit with fringe and a gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here, and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations, and aid organizations, also appeared on stage for the hour-long spectacle.
But there was a moment of terror when many in the audience mistaken the sound of a metal lab barrier collapsing for gunfire, became frightened, and tried to flee.
Soon there was panic, people were running around.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
But the NYPD and musician Chris Martin calmed the crowd off the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anybody", said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the Global Citizen Festival concert were available online for free, as they are every year.
Those who wanted to get their hands on one had to read and share texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
The crowd cheered for the many musicians and actors, while Republican Senator Jeff Flake received a standing ovation.
He was speaking on stage with his fellow Democrat Chris Coons for greater equality between men and women.
But on Friday, Flake spoke in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee to support the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, shocking many women.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake demanded an FBI investigation into the allegations after he was confronted by two women who claimed to have experienced sexual assault on their way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can always come with me in an elevator", Flake told the crowd at the New York concert.
Press freedom: Federal government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt, he said, was not the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had caused a great disturbance, which was unacceptable.
He said that's why he had bodyguards take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellery.
This applies irrespective of whether the concern is legitimate or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or supporting or being members of banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership holds the movement responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
The latest case of the jailed journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel has caused a stir.
They were released and allowed to return to Germany, but the two are still on trial in Turkey.
Florian David Fitz is drunk with Ina Müller
As fresh and handsome as he is, his fans usually know him as Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice, and yes, that's Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
- Hamburg The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the German Broadcasting Corporation, is known for its cheerful conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
The hostess Ina Müller and her guests drink a few beers, some wine or even higher-profile drinks to lighten the mood and lighten the tongue.
Many celebrities also take courage from the mandatory vocal contributions.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz, known for such films as "Hearts of Men", "Terror - Your Judgment" and "The Sexiest Day Ever".
The Munich man didn't like the trip to the far north.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled on it, his eyes just two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a powerful hangover.
He posted some lessons to his fans, which he has now learned: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule number two: never drink the black pig.
And the spray.
And the round of egg liquor Ina throws at 2:30, leave it out.
The 43-year-old's drinking is really on his face.
His fans posted a few tips on how to fight the hangover.
They ranged from instant broths, fish rolls, or - perhaps most effective - headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the usually attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nighttime drunken state is still unknown.
But since she's been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be a lot more experienced...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has a history of vandalism and disorder.
The entrance to the 36-kilometer-long railway cycle route in the Red-Capped Country in Treysa is hard to find and is paved.
Recipes for rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and junk, demolished garbage cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance to the cycle path on Haaße Hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the model object, the railway cycle path in the Red Cap country, a more than infamous sight.
The issue has been a concern for members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt for some time, but others have also been concerned, according to the city's cycling commissioner, Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from moving the seating area to regularly emptying the waste bins and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of any other possible activities", says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local council.
Not only is the garbage driving cyclists and residents around - the seating area is a regular meeting place for celebration on weekends.
Not only is the noise often loud, but the rails are also destroyed: poles torn out of the ground, garbage cans demolished, signs knocked over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers had cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
They're upset that the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for drunkards.
"The whole cycle path is clearly centered on Haaße Hill", says the cycling officer, who is now also looking after the new cycleway in Ziegenhain, which opens today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be very expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may raise the threshold for the use of public property significantly.
That would, however, require a police patrol to be on the scene soon.
The main aim of Desertshagen is to develop the Haaße Hill.
He said it needed to be made more attractive.
The frequency of cycling so far is very satisfactory.
The tourist marketing is still expanding.
Our cycle path is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany", say the ADFC members.
The situation in Ascheröder Street in Treysa is considered extremely dangerous by ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
There's no turning on the hatred hill.
In busy traffic cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two traffic flows", she explains.
This is not a problem for sport drivers, but it is for older people and especially for children.
Music competition at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
D "A song for Hiltrup", is the appeal of the Hiltrup district campaign, in the "Music Contest for young and old, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with winking in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it soon became a family gathering over coffee and cake by the volunteers of the Cultural Station.
Seven bands took part, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time resident of Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the writers see themselves as?
The locations were the Hiltruper Lake and the Marktallee.
Rolf him cut the alley in his hit song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
It was always about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short rebuilding pauses with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg was discovered to have studied chemistry but now taught guitar.
Franke knew about the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, who had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has, in the meantime, posted it on YouTube.
"It's not about winning", Franke said.
In fact, all the participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
But there was something special for the jury favorites - so that others could hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: him with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again at the final - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, the appeal of the melody and its recognition value.
The jury was made up of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The district offensive had called the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" at the soon-to-be-full cultural station.
The word game "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams, facing each other.
Each page has a viewfinder with four keyword cards that you can only decipher - the old red-slide trick - once you insert them.
This ensures that the other party cannot read anything even by mistake.
The maps then say, for example, from left to right: "1.
Second window.
Three, the dice.
Fourth, firm".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
Because the guessing game is not about terms, it's about codes.
One player per team is the code breaker.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2".
The purpose of "Decrypto" is not to guess the terms behind the secret slide, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe the terms "cube", "party" and "window" in this order and in this example, so that his own team can recognize the correct order and the opposing team can't, because he wins the game if he can crack the code twice.
So the code-breaker takes notes and reads out loud: "Toss" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to "Fest"; of course, something like "Party" would be possible here, and "Prague" because he's been watching in school and knows the window fall there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You may not know the terms of the other side, but they can be more closely related to any clues the encoder gives.
So the descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, or you're making it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book, unfortunately.
The players will probably have to study it long and hard before they can play it.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you start, you will be fascinated by the depth of emotion involved in this unpretentious game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primum "Codenames", which also focuses on an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're just trying to guess and not score points, you can easily come up with a version for two.
Man shouts Hitler salute to police and harasses guests in pub
A 48-year-old man doubled the number of police officers at Kulmbach Police Station on Saturday night.
He first showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper Town, and later he was also caught in a bar in the Upper Town harassing other guests.
After he failed to comply with the police's order for a place in the police station in Kulmbach, he had to spend the night in the police inspectorate's cell.
He will also be held criminally liable for using the badges of unconstitutional organizations when sober.
The factory Pressig was home to the Schublocks
The Pressig railway station was the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railroad history came to an end.
"When buffers banged on buffers, it was heard in the whole of Pressig", recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the town and the station.
It didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons squeaked.
That was a railroad.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's home town of Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald has a place been so affected by the railway.
This was the starting point of the steep-ramp mountain route to the north, which after a climb of about 220 meters has its summit in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, formerly, train and shovel blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, conducting and railway workshop.
"The heart of the project was the rotary drive, which, after a renovation in 1899, had a diameter of 18 metres", says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railway worker for 47 years.
The Pressig railway company, which was taken over by Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalbe subsidiary lines.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steamers and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already reduced the need for train and shunting blocks.
From 1977 onwards they were used only on freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10 000 wagons were still being sorted each month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were dismantled, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that no better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport, has been considered".
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld, the Nuremberg railway directorate held a grand festival in Pressig on the day of Pentecost 1989.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here", recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, it's off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and Pressig Rangier Station was history.
"The most difficult work in the train was done by the rangers and the brake-layers", recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have been fatal.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Scoring the opening goal at the China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon champions Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the Beijing tennis tournament, as Julia Görges has already done.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina as the number 13 Russian gave up.
The Swabian now has to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition opened in Mittelehrenbach over the weekend as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open air of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It is organised by the Tourist Association "Rund um Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 examples of 20 artists are now on view in Mittelehrenbach.
The opening ceremony was attended by Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann, Minister of Finance.
He's been with us since the first class.
So did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as both a master arranger and an artist.
But somehow, a few days ago, Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in the hands of proven, young people with good prospects for the future.
Both have been active in the selection of artists and in the design of flyers in the past.
Once again this year, they will be presenting a 70 cent stamp designed by them for the occasion of Art & Enjoyment, available at every art station.
The poster "Betzn austanzen" by Volker Hahn, designed by the artist, is also available for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high response to the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was chosen to be the musical director.
As the visitor walks through the spacious garden, he quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "luck tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a luminously colored log with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes, and 24 aluminum tubes as its sounding device.
With the sun flashing through the bush in the background, the object seems fairy-tale-like and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to write in three-dimensional letters about the event 15 years K&G.
There's a lot of pieces moving in the wind.
Halfway through the exhibition Siegrid Frey from Eckental showed her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows off his colorful imaginary clay, cement and stainless steel figures.
The theme of "wind performance" to stroll through the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition is open to the public until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtans also expressed their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They were not willing to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no singing life in the district.
It's now legendary, they raised the MGV 68 Albacht from the ashes on a bench in the tin bush.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in a grand way in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today", presumed chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
150 guests were present, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the foundation celebration for the anniversary.
It was a tradition for years, then we took a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was it, so festive attire had been asked for before.
Instead of sitting in rows at the "House of Meeting", the guests sat comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, the crowd was in for a treat: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of MGV 68 Albachten have let their voices be heard.
Fittingly, happy songs were sung.
Almost put, "A day like this, as beautiful as today".
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" was pronounced, which is the Latin word for "hop".
Once again, the choir was led by Richard Homann, one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under him", Holstiege said. "He has such a light manner, it's a masterpiece he accomplishes".
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
And then there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at his desk until three in the morning, creating his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented a well-sounding poetry.
There was a big raffle, too.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the All-Weather Zoo for the children of the Albatross Youth Center.

Volleyball: Women's third league: USC II wins first-class derby against BW Aasee
The Ascendant is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well equipped in League three.
No shyness or fracksaws, the independents doing their thing.
And that was a very good 3-0 against city rival BW Aasee.
"It was not crystal clear, but we have already made an impression", says the moderately satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied".
The evening was a good one at a birthday party for Ronja de Boer, and the game was decided.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get it to the finish line, a game like this can be a turning point", Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, USC, with its routine forces, made it through and took full advantage of the situation.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby like this.
It won't break our necks.
I've seen some really good volleyball", Annacker said, not arguing with the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents goes seems unpredictable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that", says Axel Büring.
Only one thing he feels is validated: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
They're not even close to being in the same league as Regional League volleyball".
If the vest doesn't get dirty in the next few weeks, they'll have to look up.
But you can't get a first score until you've played ten or eleven games.
We're not going to Emlichheim until Saturday.
Aasee will play in Essen on 14 October.

And of course, the fans are already thinking about a successor.
While Didi Cowboy is considered a favorite, some fans are showing some humor.

Four injured in accident at intersection in Hildburghausen
Four people were injured in an accident.
According to the information so far, a driver had not noticed the other's driveway in Coburger Street on Sunday just before noon.
The cars collided.
The four injured were taken to a hospital by ambulance.
There were traffic jams.
The cars had to be towed.
The fire brigade of Hildburghhaus evacuated the accident site.
Flight crashes - student pilot dead
The pilot died in the crash of a glider in Essen.
The one-seater plane crashed on a parking lot near the Essen-Mülheim airport on Sunday afternoon, a police spokesman said.
The parking lot off Highway 52, which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair, was largely empty, no other people were injured in the crash.
Emergency nurses continue to provide care for flight students and eyewitnesses on the ground.
Nearby was the site of an Oktoberfest, and many guests were expected to attend the evening.
The cause of the crash was unclear at first - the weather was good, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport, used a lot by pilots with light private jets.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody, Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband.
On the "Dream Ship", Heide Keller became a star.
Now she's openly talking about how the show may have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star may have been partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this job, travelled the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues looked at me as if I were their equal", Keller told Bild am Sonntag.
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the only place the reporters called was Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much".
She feels that while it is possible that her husband at the time may have been jealous, "like many men, Hans was afraid to talk about problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried to be the one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I was pretending", she explains.
She always felt that she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared sassy and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes once again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil marriage, I was crying in the dressing room, wanting to cancel.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why didn't it work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller said he imagined love "like a movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I was too naive about love".
The night butterfly, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ department of Zurich, has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but it is a little light-fearing.
And the brilliance of the green carpet on the six-tone floor dazzles him beyond measure.
But it's a film festival, and there are a lot of celebrities who want to shine in the spotlight.
So he stumbles across the square late Thursday night to take a nap in the Aquatic Toilet Oasis.
The name of the public toilet, sponsored by a large sanitary company and premiering at the festival, is: The service centre on the ground floor of a new pavilion is working hard to create a luxurious ambience.
But tonight, for some reason, the men's oasis is stinking up to heaven.
So out here, across the street, guests, who just had their opening movie, Green Book, entertained at its best in the next theater, celebrate the festival's opening with a party in the three-story warehouse, as they do every year.
The name of this festival is perfectly appropriate , because the works on display come from all over the world .
What do you have to do to get your head around an article about this festival to avoid falling into the trap of underwriting its 190 partner companies?
The butterfly ties a band around the tentacles that a fairy has given it, and two bully doormen actually wave it in generously.
Inside, the guests crowd, dancing to live music well into the middle of the night or letting DJs play rhythms to which they shout at each other, and sipping delicious snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen in the basement, oysters are waiting for mouths to sip, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the thing is, all the shelves full of exclusive products haven't been cleared for the occasion.
It's been like this for years, so it seems to work without any major losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If those are two separate instructions, he's got the dress code wrong.
But it's more of a conditional construct, and it's certainly saved lives.
In the upstairs household goods section, the chicken is tipping off an espresso cocktail called "Golden Eye", to match the festival award.
The prize for the best drink is not necessarily awarded to the mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for years for that brand, is not here that night either.
But between local celebrity, cash register and kitchenware, a face that seems familiar to the viewer moves past: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
I don't think his lead actor is far away.
And really, Viggo Mortensen, who is almost sixty, almost like a choirboy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being chatted to, or picked on, or even seen.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as a lack of enthusiasm, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is happy for his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home of Mexico.
After a 2-0 win for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the booth, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip, a member of the team dances in a yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division champion had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: USC 1st Division: Last-minute broadcast of "Destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His defenders were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had played well, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, for long periods of time.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept through", the ASV coach was angry.
The hosts quickly led 8-1, and Bieletzki's early break did not bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a shock came over the team", Bieletzki summed up the second quarter.
At halftime, the gap was two goals.
The best of the show, Marius Hintze, was the second time in a row.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst was out at 15:15, after which the relegate led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly reassuring three (29:26).
And then what?
The impartial parties must intervene.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for blame on others.
But the 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought hard, they were good in the back against seven guys and they kept throwing to the empty goal.
They can't buy much for the compliments.
"Now we must win a damn victory", said the unreserved Bieletzki.
The following are the goals scored by Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old girl from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are searching for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, emergency workers dug up a road near Marxgrün.
The police and prosecutors said that the pavement and several layers of pavement were removed.
New evidence suggests the missing woman may have been buried not far from her home.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
The investigators didn't rule out a crime back then.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian State Monuments Protection Agency, the investigators used a ground radar to find an unusual feature under the road at Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained to sniff human bones, the officers narrowed the scene to a few feet.
The results of the excavations were expected to be announced in the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users highlights the dangers that lurk on the net.
However, users can also provide additional security themselves.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should use passphrases to secure their online accounts.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it is not harmful to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his threatened dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the SEC filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost his license to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk also steps down as chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German supervisory board.
He can stay on as chairman.
In the settlement, which still needs to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous executive in Manhattan federal court for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not guilty
Musk has said he did nothing wrong and is sad and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company public and pay $420 per share, saying the funding was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Musk later backed down, saying Tesla should stay on the stock market.
Now, following the agreement, Tesla must find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Sturridge saves Liverpool by 1-1.
Liverpool were still 1-1 at Chelsea.
In the first leg of the match against Chelsea, the striker who was just replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp scored in the 89th minute for 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins to start, Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remain third, new leader is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard took the lead with his sixth goal of the season in the 25th minute.
After that, the Klopp team missed the equalization several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared after a solo by Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31.).
Just before the end, Sturridge delivered the Reds with a slugger in the corner.
Manchester United, the reigning champions, are slipping deeper into crisis after their worst start to a season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United deservedly with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven days of play only in the middle of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion with goals from Raheem Sterling (29.) and Sergio Agüero (65.).
Leroy Sane prepared the 1:0 and Ilkay Gündogan was not used by the new leader.
Let's Dance judge Joachim Llambi and Mrs Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi seems to have separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert became known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Beshal content) reports, citing Lamb's lawyer, about the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert.
"Our clients have parted company by mutual consent and in good faith", said lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, according to BamS.
The two now have the welfare of their two daughters as their most important concern.
The couple met in a pizza place in 2003 and married two years later, according to the report.
Joachim Llambi is from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his jury work on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as through various appearances in quiz and entertainment shows.
Arrests at demonstration in Barcelona
Barcelona - Demonstrations in Barcelona on Saturday have seen clashes with police.
Separatist supporters threw paint powder at police who were preventing them from holding a counter-demonstration.
According to local media reports, 14 people were lightly injured.
Six people were arrested in total.
Polls: 46% do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, GroKo has taken several survey lows.
The SPD is falling behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday nationwide for the first time.
In the weekly poll by the polling institute, the AfD is up one point to 17 percent, while the SPD is down one point from the previous week to 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU are also losing a count and are down to 27%.
This is the lowest level for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens are at 15%, the Left 11%, and the FDP 10%.
If the German parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only get 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The government parties consistently get 43 to 45 per cent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
In the 2017 federal election, they collectively won 53.4 percent.
The other parties also have a wide range: the AfD, the second largest party in several polls, has 15 to 18 per cent.
The Greens are up to 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an upward and downward uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent, depending on the share of the vote.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 German parliamentary election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person to hold the chancellorship, as the Emnid poll commissioned by BamS showed.
Only one in two (50 percent) currently wishes the grand coalition to last until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, according to the survey, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday showed a clear decline in Merkel's popularity.
The German people are also divided on whether Merkel should run for CDU presidency again in December.
47% are in favour, 44% are against, according to Emnid.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
A billboard at Aldi: reduced price for love
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says there's no more romantic dating in Tinder's day should go to Aldi's and talk about turkey.
Munich - In an era of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a meeting place for the great love exudes an almost anachronistic romance.
Yeah, right, a conversation about reduced turkey, a boxers' shorts bargain at the dining room table, or a favorite pudding is still a better story for the grandchildren to have than a simple swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being less of a contact exchange and more of a slippery exchange.
We've been testing how women react to not being talked to for a long time in the first message.
Here's the amazing result.
It has the potential to be a real Hollywood love story when the love story is preceded by a lost-and-found plot.
If the guy also contacts his lover at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So the woman who wrote this ad in an unknown Aldi office is hoping to find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about "30 percent reduced organic turkey".
For believing in the magic of analog dating, she definitely earned her Hollywood happy ending.
Billerbeck: 500 caps for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri school has been participating in the campaign "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, called polio in German, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the poliovirus, can only be contained by vaccination, according to a press release.
Reus and Zorc call for peace for idols
BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate over Mario Götze's fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
It's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us", said the Götze-friendly giant after the 4:2 win in Leverkusen on Sky TV.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Eberl: "No rush in negotiating with Hecking"
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football league Borussia Mönchengladbach does not see any hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a contract yet.
There's no set date for when we're doing this.
"But there will certainly be a moment when we sit down and talk", Eberl said on Sunday night on Sky TV.
Football: District league: researcher VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this young season when Alois Fetsch and his men went to court.
He was a poor man of words, but the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, withdrew (inwardly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
Meanwhile, it's back to the way it was.
A fresh proof is the 1-1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, which was only a breath away from advancing in the previous season.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We've narrowed the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That was obvious", Fetsch praised his boys and called each one of them after the game, to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After Nico Frerichs injury (muscle problems) - Luca Rehberg came in for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was in the front waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had a lot more game in the first half.
And the chances.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This almost took its revenge when the SCA in minute 41 twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously hit the Wolbecker box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his field.
After the break, the VfL brazenly took full control.
Thewes was a close 18 yards.
Schroer was also late for a Thewes submission after 58 minutes.
With the substitution of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side missed another fresh cell treatment.
When Chris Naberbäumer of Altenrhein fell Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 meters before the guest house.
The foul played himself and demonstrated his danger at Standards.
Westhues' right-handed thing hit down the left from the shooter's view - 1-0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be a hell of a long time.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck in the 80th minute, unfortunately, took the leather in the penalty area.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Wolbeck had to survive for a few minutes in the final stage before Geske still had the winning goal in the 87th minute from twelve metres.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Data Protection Supervisor.
The article's headline was "VfL Wolbeck's research performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging"
Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4 to 1 against Hanover 96
Starting position: four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96 Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home victory.
Forward Ante Rebic, who was in the starting lineup for the first time after an injury, was supposed to help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a leg injury and should have prevented the SGE from conceding more goals according to standards with his head ball strength.
Readings before the game: How Eintracht Frankfurt wants to keep climbing, which construction sites Eintracht Frankfurt will have to close soon - and how Allan Souza still wants to win at Eintracht Frankfurt.
In retrospect, Eintracht Frankfurt lose to Borussia Mönchengladbach after a disappointing 3-3 performance, according to the analysis of our sports reporters Ingo Durstewitz and Thomas Kilchenstein.
Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
The accident happened while I was landing on the runway.
The four occupants were lightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, a tragedy occurred at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
Turbulence occurred during the landing of a helicopter, police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught in a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill.
Immediately, the police, emergency services and fire departments were notified.
The emergency services arrived at the accident site with a large order.
The ÖAMTC medical helicopter was also called in to be cautious.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, it all turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident are still unclear and are under investigation.
According to firefighters' spokesman Franz Resperger, the fire was a small one, but it was quickly extinguished.
Report by the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity on company boards
This means that only 8 percent of the board members were women on the date of the survey, September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was pre-submitted by the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to change their approach, or international competitors will be outpacing them", said Wiebke Ankersen, Foundation Director.
In the USA, Britain or Sweden, he said, with few exceptions, all-male management teams are long since unthinkable.
The lag makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and forward-looking.
It's a different company culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German listed companies was also due solely to positive impulses in the companies in the MDax index.
Although Allbright reports that only 6.8 percent of the board of directors are women.
The previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 per cent.
The 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - had a stagnant female share.
The last time 26 women were on the board.
"I am sure that Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again next year - in their own interest", Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have indicated that they will not commit to increasing the share of the previously 'zero percent'.
The figure for the supervisory boards is different: As of September 1, the percentage of women on the boards was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year earlier.
"If the same number of women were recruited to the board of directors each year, the proportion would reach 40 percent by 2023", says the report.
Some even make a mess of it: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer makes the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians earn 280,000 euros for every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: that slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble vendors makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers earn per car they sell?
This is the question that Autopapst and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhoffer have been asking.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of €69,000 for every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only makes around €800, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of money into every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are in the race with prices averaging between EUR 33,000 and EUR 38,000 per car and around EUR 3,000 profit before interest and taxes EBIT.
On her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she was going to be a mother for the first time.
The longtime No. 1 finished her career late last year with 25 Grand Slam titles - five in singles - for good.
In July she married the Zuger Harald Leemann.
She didn't give up her date of birth.
Torchlight parade to mark the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
The tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight parade.
For the 60th time, the association is organizing the wine festivals, which will henceforth take place every Saturday in October in the large tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the leaders of the festival moved through the place to the festival square under the sounds of the march of players from Wiesenbronn.
In the already packed tent, the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests.
You can be proud of that", Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically toasted the guests from the stage.
"It's nice to see so many people have found their way back to us in Abtswind".
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder church dedication was also celebrated, the association had fixed the drink prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A feast evening for the 60th Festival of Wine will be held on Friday, October 5, at the guest's home before the second round will be held in the tent a day later.
In Bonn, a taxi crashed into a notary's car
An ambulance is heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured.
When emergency medical services are called, they should help - preferably even save lives.
One such rescue operation ended in death for a 26-year-old woman in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in a collision between an ambulance and a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the paramedic and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance had run a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then ran into the taxi at a crossroads, which was driving at green.
The doctor's car slammed into a traffic light and a tree after the collision.
He caught the passenger, who died at the scene.
Ambulance driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the ambulance driver were seriously injured and were trapped in their vehicles and had to be rescued by emergency services.
The 29-year-old paramedic, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency physician who was called in tried to do so - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police are working closely with the Bonn prosecutor's office to determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After a disgraceful defeat in the League Cup, Manchester United are now losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
ManU are down 1-3 against West Ham United.
The scene in the 74th minute was symbolic, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored 3-1 for West Ham, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside on Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defenders stopped, giving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball to helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously insufficient output over long distances.
The mood at United's city rival Manchester City is very different.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's arch rival Pep Guardiola, came from behind to win 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defense for the first time for the home team.
Sergio Aguero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, secured the sixth win in the seventh game, and thus the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool are no longer the leader
Three days after losing 1 to 2 in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool in the Premier League 1 to 1 against Chelsea.
As in the Cup final, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final.
Shaqiri, who came on in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge was better in the 89th minute with his shot.
So after the Reds started the week with a perfect record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and then the Blues dropped Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated a 2-0 victory.
The Gunners fans, who were playing Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success story against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart punched an inside-the-park home run by Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal have moved past Watford with their fifth consecutive win and are now in fifth place behind their arch rival Tottenham.
Wolves are unbeaten in the league for the fifth time in a row, with a 2-0 win over Southampton.
VW's core brand is missing: Paris motor show in the wake of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
The German carmakers are also expected to be busy at the Paris meeting, where the diesel scandal and the fight for driving bans and retrofits will be a major issue.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new products in the French capital next week, along with competitors from all over the world.
Diesel is no longer a major factor.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are nevertheless likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny backdrop of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models with them: the e-tron from Ingolstadt is due to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC from Stuttgart in 2019.
Officially, they've both been presented.
BMW's iNext is not due to launch until 2021.
The new 3s is the center of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their respective halls.
The exhibition, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, alternates with the IAA in Frankfurt every two years.
In 2016, there were well over a million visitors.
The massive earthquakes and the resulting tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, more than 500 people have been injured.
The island had been rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake was 5.9 on the Richter scale, the second 7.4.
The Commission has not yet received any reply from the Member States.
After the quakes, the tsunami struck the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
The number of victims is expected to rise sharply.
The numbers so far are from Palu only.
But many other communities along Sulawesi's west coast are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate a worship service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the bikers' graduation service was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship service (MoGo) takes place at Nordhelle House on the last Sunday of each month.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by the bikers in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers gathered for a service that was far from ordinary.
By 10 a.m., the men were lined up in front of the church's entrance.
The first was the biker breakfast, which was to be served with coffee and cake or with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also there.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical score was composed by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests more poetic-calm tones", says Pastor Frank Schröder.
Yesterday was certainly a new development in the history of motorcycle worship.
The homeowners' association in Füchtorf is having a big party.
And even during the actual day of action, Borish was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.
The project was also very interesting to Georg Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished audience step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Many of the children did not yet know how to make a tasty drink.
But they were able to see this important work step too late that Friday afternoon.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apple pieces, which looked a bit like pickled apples, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice ran slowly into a large vessel.
But the Vegetarian farmer had already bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older visitors with the latest feathered stuff.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents started talking while the children not only followed the process of apple pressing but also discovered the hop-on hop-off for themselves.
Activists of the Fuehtorf Association of Former Soldiers also took part in the festival and invited people to play games at some stations.
The home club will also be hosting an action day next year.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, the home in the heart of the savings village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
1:4 against Frankfurt, Hannover with fourth straight season's best.
After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around him and encouraged them.
However, there was not much to see in the previous 1:4 (0:2) of the table final at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to come out of it as a team", said 96-year-old football pro Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "That's disappointing of course, because you always do a lot".
Lower Saxony, which is further away, with only Florent Muslija (86) joining, is at the bottom with two points and is a candidate for relegation in its current constitution.
Led by the superior Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful general practice for the Europa League match against Lazio Roma.
Croatia's vice-champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of Hesse on his debut and never got caught by Hannover's defence.
The striker, who has been struggling for a long time since the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for the unity.
Alongside Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by Liverpool, was in the starting lineup of the Frankfurt team for the first time.
A headball by Lucas Torró (17), thrown into the net, was a first-time danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last minute by the 96-yard linebackers by Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) who was out for a short period.
The leadership for the masters fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a corner, Haller extended head to head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to stop the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who came from French second division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still in the game before the break.
This time, Haller was able to match his teammate Rebic, who was able to refuel and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser did not have a chance.
In the half, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his XI and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons were now playing a little more boldly forward, but the ideas remained out until just before the end, when at least the next hit was successful.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put it across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a showdown for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, Jovic also scored a minute before the end.
Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Despite the cool temperatures, the atmosphere was good at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter was able to make it to the opening of the 185th Street in front of a million people.
Munich won last week by two strokes.
Geisingen: Christians in Geisingen celebrate the feast of the Holy Cross
The Catholics of Geisingen celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or the Sunday after.
The service is held in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, which dates from the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Then the gunshot wound bled.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
It is still unfinished, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The church service was poorly attended, despite its importance for the parish of Geisingen.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended with the final blessing.
For many years the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the Catholic parish for the secular part of the celebration.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty meals as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather-adapted farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours of the town church, and on behalf of the parish community, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction works, which will continue until next year.
The fact that the scaffolding has been in place for some time has made it possible to determine the damage more precisely and to prepare the individual tenders more concretely.
The renovation is certainly more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has been found, which was only possible with the opening by scaffolding.
The plasterwork is complete, the natural stone work is to begin before winter and it is hoped that well over half of this work will be completed this year.
Opening ceremony: New residential building in the Münsterblickstraße in Neu-Ulm
The Donau-Iller Life Assistance Foundation is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" in Münsterblickstraße is now being handed over to its intended purpose - that was agreed upon by all present at the inauguration.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of the Donau-Iller Life Assistance Centre for some time now rely on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger spaces and accessible accesses for all areas were all considered in the design by architect Rudolf Bader.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army Officer's Building was put to the test for handicapped residents: "The house had aged and was no longer modern in its furnishings", Bader said, looking back.
In 2016, the diggers moved in to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, the architect said.
The Donau-Iller family opens a new residential home
The new building was built with an investment of around EUR 4.6 million.
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million and the County of Swabia EUR 450,000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has been carried out within the planned framework - both in time and in terms of funding.
The director of the German charity, Jürgen Heinz, thanked him for this too.
The trade-off between an accessible and at the same time fireproof design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with many specifications that would allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move around without assistance.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also expressed similar sentiments: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need aids to be mobile".
The company's main business is to provide a service to the local population.
He added: "The land in this location is a real lucky break, because it is no longer available in the current situation".
The new residential home in Münsterblickstraße, which covers almost 1500 square metres, can accommodate 30 disabled people in three groups.
Heinz, the head of Life Assistance, is proud of the 11 full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a fixed-rate basis.
Germany: Sister complains about differences between East and West
- Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the Deputy Chairman of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all her compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences", the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the daily Mirror on Sunday.
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than people in West Germany but were paid 15 percent less.
"I can't explain it to anyone almost 30 years after German unity", Sister said.
North Korea: Does this neat dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan is supposed to smooth the waters between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae-in a gift of two North Korean Pungsan hounds.
Moon's office said Sunday that the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
They were therefore passed through the border town of Panmunjom with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the animals' adjustment".
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears, and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the friendship at the third summit between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to jointly compete in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to jointly bid to host the 2032 Olympics.
In the course of the rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile test facility.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
To mark the centenary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months this year, numerous new books have appeared that answer this question, usually in the light of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, explains it in a different way in his magnificent picture book Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to work - that is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition working week starting today.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the situation in the country.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to ask the right question, what is the difference between work and manual labor, but never mind.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself once again to its task - to govern - it should not be deterred by debates on concepts.
The European Union and the SPD will have to work together to achieve something after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet in the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the fighting.
The first is the diesel upgrades and the law on skilled immigration, which have brought conflicting issues back on the agenda.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
While the diesel crisis over the weekend has brought the Union closer together, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned law on skilled migration.
The SPD calls for a residence prospect for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is firmly opposed to the 'reversal' of the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute between the coalition partners - and how could it be any different?
It is not Gei und Gleich that has joined forces to create GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different societal images and priorities.
Fighting is good.
A society characterized by such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests cannot move forward without a dispute.
But to be constructive, the dispute must not be re-ignited for partisan reasons over the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should argue - but always keep in mind the reality of people's lives.
What is possible and beneficial for many?
This key question will help to clarify both the diesel and the change of track question in a pragmatic way - and thus to restore confidence.
The people's parties must fight for this now.
Pilz checks hours at Hartinger
Minister in the crosshairs
Does the Minister of Labour violate the law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" their legal staff had been working on the social security reform, a boisterous social minister reported at the presentation of the reform two weeks ago.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
It is assumed that the Minister was merely expressing her enthusiasm for the work of her team and did not intend to announce any breaches of the law in front of the cameras.
However, she now has questions to ask Hartinger 'to clear her of any suspicion'.
Police are ripping up a street in search of female bodies
Marxgrün - Lange, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, excavations have been underway on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained to sniff out old human bones, was able to narrow the relevant area down to a few meters in a series of operations with its guide.
In addition, scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian State Monuments Protection Agency discovered a soil anomaly in the area of the road.
For more than a year now, the prosecutor's office and the criminal police have been working on the missing persons case.
A cycle path was blocked and examined with sonar equipment at Marxgrün because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here during the construction of the new state road 30 years ago.
Paint and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will take place for the first time.
But even before that, there's a fight.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the fall of 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence supporters, among other things, with paint powder, when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the national police and the civil guard.
Some 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to hold a rally to honor their colleagues who participated in the illegal referendum in the polling stations last year.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting had also led to violence.
Catalan police have formed a chain to keep separatist demonstrations and central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 or so separatists then tried to break through the police chain by force, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in detention.
New elections were held in the region in December.
The new Catalan government took office in May and the forced administration was ended.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Westphalia: Confusion gathered: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate without a goal
Red-white cloves continue to step on the spot.
FC Gütersloh also lost 0-0.
The final light and the third-last one turned out to be a confused crowd in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald Stadium.
The first half was pretty manageable from the entertainment factor.
So those who wanted to get a beer or a hot dog could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a torchance, for there were virtually none.
First shot in half an hour .
The first (harmless) goal of the whole game was scored by Güterslohs Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener team had the best - and in principle the only - chance when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was to change early.
Forward Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the switch, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 metres just over the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher also made their first offensive appearance.
After a ball conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it went smoothly.
The quick count over Sinan Aygün was "crowned" by Nick Flock (62) with a but sloppy shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also added a header from Wieckowicz (66) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It didn't work.
The Ahlener did not achieve anything more than visual superiority on their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had his last chance, but that didn't help either.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive afterwards: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"We were not as dangerous as against Holwickede this time, even though our opponent didn't want to play here", said RW Ahlens' interim coach.
Offensively, "it was all a bit of a blur" against a team that just wanted to defend.
I didn't feel we could get a goal back", says Daut.
But to his chagrin, the spectators did not feel that his team could score a goal.
The show was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Luckily there are enough creamers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table-Distribution Office are delighted to receive these donations.
The volunteers assure us: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the space was still a little empty.
"This is such a nice, social place, that's why we're here today", said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival, Franz Josef Holthaus, greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper touch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer intervened shortly.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creamers.
And the "substitute" was able to entertain the growing audience with music.
The response was so good that some folk songs were sung late in the evening.
"It's just great", Marcel Kreimer said with delight.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to fit the opening date into his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many assets with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be such a thing as a board", he said, thanking the men's choir for their action.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who worked at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the Clean up campaign.
Our garden city is getting a colorful coat of paint - here goes something.
Then, with the help of the fire department, the maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was removed and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were used for bodily welfare.
From sweet to hearty, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative with his decoupage saw.
He had veneer work, beer caps with rectangular patterns and a lot more.
A special offer was made by three beekeepers from Reckenfelder: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a special treat.
Honey cake in a glass, with honey of my own production, of course.
Little Elsa had to use it over and over again, because the cake was so good.
The social atmosphere was what kept the visitors up late, even without the stage program that is not available at the Autumn Festival.
The local government's message: no success in advertising a skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have been advertising in a way that is hardly favorable for the construction of a skate park.
In several places there are corresponding smears, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with criminal damage to property.
In large letters, signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall were emblazoned with the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!".
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the job fair on September 19, a corresponding inscription was discovered on the billboard at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding, it could be removed without difficulty.
"A few days later, it was back, this time sprayed", says Rottmann.
It is assumed that the corresponding advertising sign needs to be replaced.
This case is particularly noteworthy because several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, it will also be made possible by sponsors.
The Commission has already made a number of commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city's Department of Education, Sport and Culture, without naming them.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies on the smeared board.
The issue of skateboarding has been a topic of local policy and administration for years.
After the old one at the LWL-Klinik was dismantled, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The Council finally voted by a majority in favour of the fire station.
However, this was not implemented - too many factors seemed to be against building on this site.
At the end of June, a change took place.
The members of the main and finance committees now voted unanimously for the site of the Gutenberg school.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is with the city council.
It assumes a decision this year so that if a positive vote, it could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control shortages worsen
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European air traffic chaos of the summer, German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes", said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, to the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs intended for human consumption.
"The airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years", said the unionist.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the pilot training is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Directive.
In the Karlsruhe airspace control center alone, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives of the federal government, the states, the air traffic control, the airlines and the airports will meet to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional workload and overtime, you can't do it without us", said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German Federal Aviation Administration.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission's directives for the pilot's misery.
The Commission notes that the traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost and staff savings for national airlines are now fully reflected in the operational business.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the new rules.
The Commission is currently coordinating EU requirements until 2024 and there is a risk of further tightening.
The EU is under constant lobbying by airlines.
"Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years", said Maas.
He hopes that the high cost of delay will prompt airlines to change their minds.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", Maas said.
The annual intake of 120 students for the next five years, which has been announced so far, is just enough to compensate for the age-related drop-outs.
The necessary staffing is not yet linked to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for restructuring the group.
The Commission has decided to grant the aid to the German company, which is in difficulty, a loan of EUR 5 million.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
After two resignations, the control board on the capital side has only eight members.
The Commission has a staff of 10 representatives.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include a 50% stake in the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, will be merged into the elevator and subcontracting business.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest rallies apart with a large bid.
According to the emergency services, pro-independence forces repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They'd attack the officers with paint and rounds.
The Commission has also been informed that there were differences of rank between the participants in the various demonstrations.
Rescue workers say 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and recognition of colleagues
The police had demonstrated to honour their colleagues who had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia almost exactly a year ago, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt that it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez to AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drugged us a year ago.
A 31-year-old Balearic police officer, who refused to give his name except Daniel, denied the allegation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year did only their duty: to defend the law", he said.
But the demonstration is to assert our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", the policeman assured.
Breach of access to personal data of British ministers
A security flaw in a mobile phone app caused the personal data of ministers and MPs from the conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily made available to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown persons after the outage was announced a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.

Two people were killed when they drove their car into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on the scene.

Football: Juve coach praises top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) win over SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well", said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after an early fall from the lead with a goal from Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst pursuer for the time being.
The Real Madrid goalkeeper initially took the lead from former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double-pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also made the preparation for the goal of the head of the defense Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of suggestions", the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, wants to see goals from the striker who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get better at serving him", the coach urged.
Juve's top scorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three on the board.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' superiority seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the perfect series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years is already six points ahead of Naples.
The second-placed team, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, had a chance against Turin.
But the top team was decided at the latest after the dismissal of Mario Rui (58), who had already been warned.
The Portuguese had to leave the field after a hard start against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples", commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has won at Juve.
The professional from Liverpool was in charge for all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flown off the field in the 2-0 victory of Turin and is suspended for the home game against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West is changing his name
Rapper Kanye West has made a particularly bizarre appearance on the US TV show Saturday Night Live this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frown lines and question marks in the audience.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he'll be known as "Ye".
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West", he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince, as he shed his stage name.
The pseudonym is not new, however.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible and it means 'you'", the rapper said.
Football: A1 Regional League Münster: Finally!
I got it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak play today.
The enemy was simply more agile, we hardly ever put him in trouble".
Two chances in 90 minutes, that's not often a good thing.
FC Hoetmar defeated SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two chances in the first pass, but the first one used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to take the lead early (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after a great preparation by Krause, he scored a free kick.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne failed to score against goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the second half Jan Blome also found his champion in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69) all forgave the other three.
A handed meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide put the ball over the line was the game decided (81).
"We had previously criticized each other harshly, but today was different from the last few weeks", concluded Florian Kraus.
The following are the names of the members of the Committee:
Goals: 0-1 for Krause (7). 0-2 for Berheide (81).
The Commission has also been consulted on the draft law on the protection of the financial interests of the Union.
The German team won the match by 3-1.
"I don't know what to think", he said.
"We have no access to them", presumably referring to the wingpin with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites who were conspicuously collectively offensive.
He could laugh anyway: "A dirty victory", he said, winking insolently and pulling away from there. His players, on the other hand, were relieved to notice that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, is fighting for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"That was by far our best performance of the season", he says.
"The way we came back from 0-2, the way we fought one of the top teams in the league all season, it was really phenomenal".
The more bitter it is to have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24).
He needed exactly two touchdowns in that game to score that goal.
He scored the 2-0 goal from the left side to set up a perfect match for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"What he did was insane", Lewandowski said, acknowledging the quality of his opponent.
Just before the side change, his own XI made up for it: McGill's free throw from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through the long goal line (45).
After the change of side, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59).
After that, it was back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64) and just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann scored (69).
Despite the overwhelming majority, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia goal (80.).
We must now concentrate fully on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now", Lewandowski said.
The following are the areas of activity covered by the programme:
The following players have scored goals: 1:0 Zymner (24). 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.)
The Commission has also been consulted on the draft budget.
Football: TSV Strasbourg is fighting for a point against Primus
There was no winner in the league match between TSV Strasbourg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually come for three points, however, the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
The entire board of directors of Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
The entire board of directors of the second-tier football club Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets in the evening referred unanimously to a joint letter from the board of Saxony.
The association was not confirmed at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligasten.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
I'm glad he's out of here.
There are few state guests whose departure from Germany brings such relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: distinguished guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing is offering about 80 sessions by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he will personally collect the Tolerance Prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
The Academy's director, Udo Hahn, proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have already been with us".
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker will participate in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on September 29, the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to accept the Academy's "Tolerance Award" in person in Tutzing, which is also being awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings until mid-2019 have it in them.
"The pension is not secure!" says a conference title.
'SOS at Europe's borders' - the Academy describes the 'risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean'.
"And to a conference on Syria, "Barbarism without limits".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of every human idea".
From structural racism in society to the divide between rich and poor to the radical transformation of work through digitisation, the spectrum is wide.
Academy director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to seek solutions, or at least partial solutions".
I'm at a 200th reunion.
The first is that the European Parliament has a duty to ensure that the European Parliament is able to take part in the debate on the future of Europe.
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical National Church", said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
The European Commission has launched a new initiative to promote gender equality in the European Union.
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret actress, Teubner worked to create gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks until the end of the sentence, and on the other hand, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies him so harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was, too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely, in the way that it fitted the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had introduced a paradox: the man's satisfaction comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner on the other hand, brings no benefit.
The piano solo demonstrates the same thing: What would have come out of Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrupp slips from Bach's "O Head full of blood and wounds" to "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor symphony to a playful dance.
There was a big round of applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers were presented by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, did not want to be thanked.
She had the idea of giving the duo a gig in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener had problems with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
"I was actually very happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We have not been able to control them", said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
His concentration in the final made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore lagged almost to the end, trailing at 11:12 at the break and later at 15:18 (45).
Only towards the end did the wider pool of hosts make itself decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put back-row Merle Klement on the left-wing out, who then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
The following persons are listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council:
Volleyball: Women's third league: BSV Ostbevern's top performance in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to their top performance in the top flight, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second-tier relegated VC Allbau Essen, the blue and white won 3-1.
"That was a giant leap forward for a cool season.
It's hard to be in the top third of the league.
We have worked on that", said coach Dominik Münch, who was delighted after his team's almost impeccable performance in the fall of the leader.
The first passage was dominated by guests almost at will.
He went from 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 to 25:15 to last year's runner-up.
Food was accepted in the two-bar, but not in play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent has struck at great risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV led with 12:8. "Eating has turned the adoption into a three-bar.
We couldn't keep up the pressure.
Food got sucked in, and we let ourselves be lulled in a bit", Münch continues.
At 18:17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area were ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern defended four more sets at 19:24, the fifth attempt was a goal.
"The game was now a class better", the head of the training found at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge played a significant role in the BSV's turnaround in the third period from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: "We played consistently and calmly".
At 7:3 and 15:13, the blue and white brought in four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was named Most Valuable Player, but Maren Flachmeier had a terrific day, too.

International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be put back together with great difficulty", TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu told the editorial network Deutschland.
The Turkish and German sides both missed the opportunity of a joint, conciliatory action.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslims' belonging to Germany side by side with German top politicians, Erdogan has used the term for his own purposes", Sofuoglu complained.
The broad exclusion of the German public had "reinforced many reservations".
Home club Nottuln: The offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally time for folk-meetings.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m. the Nottuln Home Club will be holding its fifth Nottuln Folk Meeting in the fireplace of the Old Amtmannei.
It's almost exactly a year since we held our first folk meeting.
In the meantime, this event has become a regular part of the musical calendar in Nottuln", says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln Home Club.
I did not expect our folk meeting to take place in Nottuln so quickly.
Whether it was storm depths in January or heat waves in July, the fireplace of the office was always full.
"The programme at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman's songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits", says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has signed on for the first folk-meet "birthday" with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with plain German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten thrilled the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the night" and sent home an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend another sociable and humorous evening", the invitation from the local club says.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be involved is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always quickly filled, it is advisable to arrive early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30pm, but admission is at 7pm.

From pure fruit to ecology
A gala was held in the Dr. Stammberger Hall to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the District Association for Horticulture and Land Care.
On September 29, 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kulmbach District Association for Horticulture and Land Care were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later, it celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
However, it was then called differently: as "District Fruit Association Kulmbach City and Country" it was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit association was also different from today's work - it was actually about fruit growing, flowers and gardening.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite of the elites", explained district administrator Günter Dippold in his keynote address.
Fruit trees were to line long-distance roads, and so-called industrial gardens were laid out in schools.
The 55 horticultural associations in Kulmbach county, which have almost 7000 members, still cultivate fruit today.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Nature-friendly horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as education, healthy eating and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Mullworms" showed how diverse the tasks of a garden association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age", said the district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of nature experiences for life.
The chestnut gathering was a huge thing for us kids, I doubt you can have as much fun with a smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees with the county councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"The district association decides where they should be", added Söllner, stressing the special importance of garden associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, even district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun left no doubt.
He showed the many visitors the long history of the circuit association with a picture talk, including the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
It used to be everything came from the garden, it was frozen for the winter.
However, at the end of the 1950s, the garden was transformed into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was there before us and we must follow it", pleaded the expert in fruit and nut trees.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
This includes welcoming new citizens to our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian State Federation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren", concluded Günter Reif, who was solemnly surrounded by the tower blowers of the Thurnau Music Association.
Daniel Huber won the summer GP in Hinzenbach
The Salzburg man won with 245.7 points, well ahead of Peier and Viiger.
Daniel Huber won the summer Grand Prix of ski jumping in Hinzenbach on Sunday.
The Salzburg man won with 245.7 points, well ahead of the Swiss Kilian Peier (237.7) and the German Karl Geiger (237.3).
World Cup record holder Gregor Schlierenzauer (236.2) was just behind the Russian overall leader Yevgeny Klimov (236.3) in fifth place.
Clemens Aigner (7.) and Michael Hayböck (9.) also made it into the top ten.
Double world champion Stefan Kraft finished in 17th place.
In the overall ranking, Huber is fifth in the Austrian ranking before the final bid on Wednesday in Klingenthal.
The results of the ski jumping competition were as follows: 1. Daniel Huber (AUT) 245.7 points (88.0 m/89.0 m) - 2. Kilian Peier (SUI) 237.7 (91.0/86.5) - 3. Karl Geiger (GER) 237.3 (87.0/88.0) - 4.

Priority for NAFTA talks: Canadian foreign minister moves UN speech
The Mexican government wants clarity on NAFTA: they're giving both trading partners an ultimatum for a deal.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving the trade agreement absolute priority - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the fight to reissue the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today, the minister will not speak until Monday before the UN General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, they're focused on renegotiating NAFTA.
Mexico's economic minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that Canada and the United States had 48 hours to reach an agreement if Canada wanted to join the trade agreement between his country and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to revise the regional free trade agreement NAFTA.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
The deal is now expected to be finalized by Sunday evening, and Trump's administration wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro has been released from hospital after being injured in a knife attack.
The extreme right-wing ex-military was about to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the daily newspaper O Globo.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make any public appearances in the final week before the presidential election in the South American country.
The politician was attacked in the open in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The not") women's organizations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations also mobilized racist and misogynistic statements against Bolsonaro on social networks.
In the economic capital of São Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He succeeded former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As former mayor of the multi-million-dollar city of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in opinion polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but recently he has presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round, a run-off election will be held on 28 October.
Observers predict that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this one successfully - no matter who he runs against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting violence against gays and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocking me with verbal distractions.
On another occasion, he said that supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims the Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale outside Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn, in front of more than 150,000 spectators, in the three days at Le Golf National, with great blows and outstanding team spirit, defeated the favorite defending champion USA by a toothless Tiger Woods.
Danish rock legend dies after a long illness
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsens website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children at his deathbed.
The musician had been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band broke up in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album Midnight at Night is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The Head of Government also recalled that the anti-monarchy Larsen had performed at the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocking night at the shoe factory: volume at hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert night with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocky live music experience on a Saturday night in the Shoe Factory hall of the Civic Centre: pure hard rock by three bands who are friends.
After the sound check and just before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of a fear of the limelight.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - will loudly entertain the approximately 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is already able to impress with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the soon-to-be-released CD.
The band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the performance in front of the stage.
Although the "add" calls are not to be overlooked, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Hard rock is not the same as hard rock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, bassist Golo Meierhenrich and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative, sometimes classic rock-like sounds of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" is striking by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
The band will be presenting their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with their performances in front of a huge audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also makes his own accents in the only cover song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
To the sound felt even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheered solo, while running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course required at such a hard rock concert: on the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the Mischpult team, the volume of the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is at the level of a pressurized air hammer, but still well below the controls of the "Wacken Festival Valley", as The Ignition points out on their website.
The deafening 120 decibels in jet blue as usual at the annual metal show in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands have already convinced the harder, rockier style with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we are, taking the bone saw and lighting a concert night with the power of a tiger", all three groups can say at the end, although in a figurative sense.
And most of all, enjoy the big applause from the visitors.

One person killed in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A sailplane crashed on Sunday at a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the crash.
A fatal accident occurred near the Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
According to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a glider had crashed in the fairground at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
The "WAZ" further reports that the student pilot was alone on board - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
The plane was on the approach path at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a fixed tent on the airport grounds.
But this weekend, there's been an Oktoberfest.
The airport is located on the border of the two Ruhr area cities and directly on the motorway 52.
The parking lot offers a Park&Ride service for large events at the Essen trade fair or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump accuses Kim of "falling in love"
It's no secret that the US president, North Korea's leader Kim, is quite well-meaning despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It's also about Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has admitted to a new flame.
The tragedy is, it's a long distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Trump was already finding tender words for the half-old descendant of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang from supporters in the US state of West Virginia, although he is proving to be a rather tough piece in the fight for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and we had a lot of back and forth", Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
I'm not going to.
No, really, I mean it.
And it wasn't just the conversations with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal relationship also bore political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announced halt in all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics see little more than lip service behind it so far.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - not everyone should be aware of.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of it when he performed at a large gym in Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he doesn't care, Trump said, pointing his index finger at the crowd, "I've always told you it's so easy being president".
But then instead of 10,000 people out there crowding into this packed arena, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many visitors to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens is full of people, full of mood and, above all, spoiled by the sun: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre has cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not only held in the tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the City by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to highlight their disastrous conditions in Libya, allowing them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the video in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July at great risk to their lives and posted it online.
"They refuse to send us back", said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The video was sent to the website France 24 Observers, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably would not have been able to return to Nigeria", Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
He said he put his life in danger with the video.
One of his fellow soldiers was beaten nearly to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks".
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homelands this year through the program, said Jorge Galindo, IOM's spokesman in the West African country.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
He hasn't heard of a video of a call for help.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as being inhuman.
The North African state, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her class for Monday, she caught a burglar.
Around 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the attic of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who began the investigation.
Whether things or money were stolen, we can't say yet.
Perp description: 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
For information, please contact the police station Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days.
A 75-year-old man had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forested area in central Franconia after he had parked his car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance near a pasture and rescued the man who had been missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old man from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He pretended to look forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a drive in his SUV through the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's whereabouts remained unknown for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This is particularly true of the wave of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He said the EU had been "very concerned" about the situation in Syria and that the country was "not prepared to accept the fact that the situation is not going to improve".
Mr Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans imprisoned in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
The European Union has a responsibility to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme is implemented in a timely manner.
The meeting between Laschet and Erdogan was moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne airport.
The event was originally scheduled to take place at the castle of Wahn, but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued his journey to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the meeting.
Laschet had canceled a joint performance at the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country".
We are also their point of contact - not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the successes in the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is demanding Washington's compliance.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent standstill is due to the US relying on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building", Ri said in New York.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way we will disarm ourselves first", the top North Korean diplomat said.
He said that sanctions could "bring North Korea to its knees" and that this is "a dream of people who don't know us".
But to build trust, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test site, Ri said.
The US side, however, had not "responsible reactions", the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations in recent days for strict compliance with the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is due to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually at a youth meeting was not noticed by the many visitors to the open-door HoT house: white blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The HoT's young people had enchanted the buffet of delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank them with food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the unpleasant surprise came: A power failure had shut down the huge, two-piece refrigerator, and the food had gone bad and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over: we had a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone", says Westbuer.
And so everybody got involved.
The result was obvious, and the guests were delighted.
"Cooks can't do it any better", said one visitor, impressed, as Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese, or cake.
"It's really amazing what the children and teenagers have done", stressed Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state board of the board
Frustrated by criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen table, Jörg Sartor, has resigned from his post in the national association.
Sartor had become nationally known because the Essen table had imposed a ban on foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of the NRW boards in July, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
I've had too many in the back.
The head of the NRW Tableau Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his longtime deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor with it.
"I can understand his step - people have spoken out who didn't know exactly why the Essen tablet was doing that".
Sartor said he was still active in the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes", Weilerswist said.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" criticism of colleagues from other panels.
We must not adopt the approach of "without us, the people in the city will starve".
It was the state's job to make sure people didn't starve.
The Essenese did not attend a congress of the tables in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm being told too much sweet stuff", he said.
There's all these social fuzzes who criticized me back then.
The game is over.
Football, district league Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Hypochlingen wins in Kirchheim after a draw - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.
In contrast to the TV hypocrites, TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1 in Kirchheim, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1.
Gladbach loses double lead - Schalke without embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach will have to wait for a win in Wolfsburg.
At 2-2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke wins their first game of the season against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has manoeuvred away in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had taken the first place behind the Bavarians last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preparation by Yewgeni Konopljanka by head, after which the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund are once again at the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had been 0-2 down against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came back to win 4:2 in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) equalised with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, ensured the crowning of the performance increase after the break with another double in the final phase (86./94.).
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
The Stuttgart team was forced to fear the Bremen side, which was decimated by a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break.
Borna Sosa and the careless goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler made a curious one-goal home run that helped the visitors to the 68th minute to equalize.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbach team, which included the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, took the lead twice, finishing 2-2 and still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for the 1-1 draw with Wolfsburg with his second Bundesligator.
In the 20 metre shots of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as well as in the second counter-shot after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is the goalie in the foal storm.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from OGC Nice was the third in a row and the seventh in the seventh qualifying match.
After seven rounds, Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred against VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to his team: the 23-year-old Serbian was sent off after a hat trick against Daniel Didavi yellow-red.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game by a curious one-goal own goal (68).
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens had already put the home team on course with a foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new names for state
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether to change the name of their country to North Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve the nearly three decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change for its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach by Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The United States had announced that if the referendum was successful, the country could quickly become a NATO member.
Syrians in the U-Have.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally beat three pensioners, severely injuring some of them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had made a riot on Friday at about 22 o'clock in the Alsergrund refuge street.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who was attacking passersby with his fists fist-tied.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officials.
It was later discovered that the suspect had just struck three elderly women (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the ground near a tram stop on Währinger Straße.
He also had trampled the trio.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, contusions and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured, the police said, "for reasons as yet unknown".
He was taken to the hospital and was monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs is marrying his boyfriend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave each other the yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered partnership was not an option for her, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
"If we get married, we'll do it right". He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for the SPD's budgetary group in the Bundestag and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheim district, the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir with an angry speech on June 30, 2017.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment", he said, referring to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the area of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters of hedges cut
There was a lot of work to do for the members of the Children's Home and the Society of Lepers.
Because about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus were to be cut.
The project was supported by the local population and involved about a dozen people.
"We do this to reduce costs", explained the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And it's been building up a lot.
Because of the hot summer, we're running late this time, but luckily it's just a mold cut.
Because the hedge had already been shaved in the spring.
The breakfast always following work has a long tradition.
"Everyone should keep their strength up", said Walter Schroer.
Hannes Aigner wins gold at the world canoe slalom championship
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg has won the gold medal at the canoe slalom world championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put together a perfect run on Sunday at the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I had enough trips here and everything was fine today", said the London 2012 Olympic runner-up.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away in joy and held out both arms in triumph - knowing that it would at least be enough for a medal.
At least he had the number four starting.
But the six remaining starters failed to match his legendary time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of the Russian Pavel Eggel.
Gauting police inspectorate reports the first attempted break-in of a single-family home this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter, and burglars are trying to take advantage of that.
The police inspectorate Gauting yesterday reported the first attempted burglary this fall.
The alarm system is the reason it stayed in the one-family house on Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators got together just before 8:00 on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
But the alarm apparently caught them off guard, and they fled without any loot.
The Commission has also been asked to provide information on the situation in the Netherlands.
The bankruptcy of Hertha: the reality has caught up: Bayern against Ajax
The predicate of unbeatability is gone: the defeat in Berlin is not to be allowed to please FC Bayern.
The next two classic games against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the first interim for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance under the new coach Niko Kovac should not rise to the greater autumn low for the Munich.
"A week ago, people thought we were invincible.
Now we have caught up with reality", said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know that this really pisses us off and we're giving it a go on Tuesday.
For the first time in over a year, no own goal was scored away, as at the same time in the pre-season two games in a row without a win, the leader of the table in the football Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as in the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg with their man-on-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful needle sticks on the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the Bavarians, who appear to be the last to be dominant, are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and we will do everything to be successful again", Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown, however, and he attributed his first defeat as a Munich coach to his once again poor handling of chances.
A win against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would make the first interim of his term positive before the break for the national games - otherwise the tone is likely to worsen.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second first-team game of the season after the 2-0 win at Benfica Lisbon.
After the Sunday break, the preparations for the second preliminary round against Ajax, which had also defeated AEK Athens 3-0 at the start, will begin as planned.
"Now we've been hit in two games, but we'll score again", announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As in the final against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke in plain text.
The lawyer acted as a reminder.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work on it again because we don't get the many chances and make the mistakes behind", the 23-year-old said just before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were even five points behind Dortmund, which now has taken the lead with a point.
And so Kimmich blinked at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good", said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in the line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan has condemned the expulsion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan from Germany with serious accusations.
DFB president Grindel sees the flaws, but defends the federation line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different fronts for the supremacy of interpretation in the long-running dispute over Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President sharply criticized the treatment of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the federation's line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the case at the Mainz ZDF "Sportstudio".
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - that something like this will not happen again", said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration representative.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced in sharp terms racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England", Erdogan said in the cathedral on Saturday.
I can't believe that our two young men, who have made it to the German national team, have been left out.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that he, unlike Özil, felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am immigrant - that is not possible.
"I'm very sorry he has such an impression", said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
He also sees no basis for Özil's return to the national team.
The Commission has also decided to appoint an additional integration officer in addition to Cacau, a native of Brazil, and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background clearly intervenes in society and football and says 'This is an important issue, we have to deal with it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration needs to work", Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office of DFB president next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can", Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg/Rödental - Police say the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10am and 1pm on Friday.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at a red light in the Lower Altitude area.
She told the pensioner that he had hit her car.
But there was no exchange of personnel, because the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a phone call about a driver who had gone off the road and hit a traffic light.
When asked, the man said he didn't want the police on the scene and then drove away.
After that, the Red-tailed Godwit drove home.
However, the retired man got lost in his home, where he has lived for decades, and hit a construction vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and arrest him.
His car was badly damaged in the accident.
The 75-year-old man seemed confused and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: still almost 1000 emergency workers on duty.
About four weeks after the moor fire broke out on a German military site in Emsland, 980 emergency workers are still working on the firefighting operations.
The German army announced this on Sunday.
The situation is stable and 70 volunteers have been withdrawn, according to a spokesman.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
On Sunday night, an underground fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster alert, which had been declared a week earlier on September 21, was canceled because of fears that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements with wind and sparks.
On Thursday, the fire was declared safe from spreading to neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 emergency workers were on the scene trying to bring the massive fire under control.
The Air Force is continuing to support the work at the German military test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
For October 2 and 5, according to the Bundeswehr, recon flights with "Tornados" are also planned.
The fire was caused by test missiles fired by Airbus engineers.
The smoke flag of the Moor fire had at times been raised up to a hundred kilometers across northwestern Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the German military plans to set up a contact point to handle damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs is marrying his boyfriend
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Almost exactly a year after marriage for all came into force, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They've been together for 25 years.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage law came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave each other the yes on Saturday in Hamburg.

Referendum on new names for state started in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any approach by Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also be giving the start to the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saved the Holocaust from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in 2016 in the United States, leaving behind a legacy that preserves the horrors of the Holocaust for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register of organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve stressed relatives.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organ harvesting can continue only with express consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register of organ donors this Monday.
It's supposed to make organ donation easier and relieve stress in families.
People who wish to donate their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be obtained from Swiss Transplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be removed only with express consent, as in Germany, Swisstransplant stresses.
It is estimated that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only five percent of the time, a card is found at the crucial moment in the hands of potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"They then have to make decisions on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome", says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are plans to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, says Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman for the Federal Health Information Office.
"There is no register where people can enter their wishes - for or against organ donation", she says.
The Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, has spoken in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
He proposed that, in the first instance, everyone be considered an organ donor unless he or his family objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects it.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
Fourteen-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in head counting.
He won the race in Wolfsburg against 39 other riders.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced this on Sunday.
Sixteen-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese schoolboy, the oldest a 74-year-old retired Frenchman, chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau, Saxony, organises the competition every two years.
For example, the tasks to date were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greet from Lastrup demonstrated how to hold a ball with his head in the air while counting.
He's one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already there two years ago, when he was 14 years old in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can't start much.
"Headache calculation can be trained", he said.
Many participants practiced for several hours a day.
In India and Singapore, there are even computer contests in stadiums.
For example, the discipline of taking the square root of six-digit numbers.
In the field of multivariate calculus, the candidates are given surprising tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The German side has a good chance here too, the head referee said.
Otherwise, Asians often have the advantage because they are taught to do arithmetic more intensively and with other effective methods at an early age.
A compelling video with naked Serena Williams: It's about early detection of breast cancer.
Tennis ace Serena Williams is showing off her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to highlight breast cancer and advocate for early detection.
It's a matter of life and death, but it's also a matter of courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams is singing upstairs without the song "I Touch Myself" by The Divinyls - just her hands covering her innermost parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died from it.
This emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself almost died a year ago.
There were complications with the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan revealed clots of blood in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turquoise Blue Coalition will submit a draft law on the so-called "Symbols Act" for consideration.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Cold polar air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle will be shaking her beds for the first time in the West next week: polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters [1,500 to 1,200 feet] at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it can drop to about 1,000 meters [3,000 feet] at high intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the High Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
The road conditions on the higher pass roads (Arlberg pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner pass, Gerlos pass, Felbertauern, Großglockner high alpine road) are therefore wintery.
Farmers can start their annual pruning on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start their annual pruning on Monday.
The unique "green walls" of Germany have characterized the landscape of the forest-poor state for some 200 years.
The hedges of trees and shrubs, up to 15 feet [5 m] wide, are "forest substitutes" and the last refuge of many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still work, said Ingo Ludwichowski, the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were founded by order of King Christian VI of Denmark in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, but also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
The name "knick" comes from that time: the twining of the branches allowed the dense, interwoven boundaries to develop.
Today, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North and Baltic Seas, giving the impression of a wooded, multi-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as replacement habitats by some 7,000 species.
In one kilometer of bend, up to 1,800 different species could live and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the knitter can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it will wither into a light tree line, which will lose its biodiversity and wind protection, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the nursery is only allowed to be used outside the breeding season from October to March.
Indonesian talks about the situation in Sulawesi after tsunami
In an interview with the German News Network (RND), local journalist Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta, on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately set off for Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport in Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office was also destroyed, but we temporarily set up a shelter for other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have fled to nearby hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people are still outside their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people steal some of the food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people still missing and have not been found.
How are communications and information on the island?
We have cell phone reception now, but it didn't work before and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know whether they live or where they are because people were not at home during the earthquake, but were, for example, on their way to work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many people thought, "Okay, no tsunami", and then it came.
In other regions that were not affected by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was coming to the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure collapsed, the earthquake hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must forgo Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be out of action for a long time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo suffered a muscle fiber tear in his left thigh in the 2-1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the German football league announced on Sunday.
In Donis' case, the doctors diagnosed a torn muscle in his thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the next international break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast for the downtime.
A torn muscle bundle usually heals within six to eight weeks, a torn muscle fiber usually heals a little faster.
The triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival is the annual culmination of the most prestigious European film festivals.
Despite all the hype surrounding the cinema, 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, with strong entries from Europe and Asia and Venice attracting a lot of attention with Oscar nominees from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, Olching's fire department tried to catch an injured duck.
The action, however, dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning, a white, injured duck was spotted by strollers on Lake Olching.
She was in the water station area.
To help the animal, passersby called the police and fire department.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck failed.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the emergency services repeatedly.
She ran out to sea.
Using a lifeboat, the firefighters were able to circle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a brave grip after almost an hour.
The duck, which had sustained a chest injury, was then taken to the LMU veterinary hospital in Oberschleißheim.
But the initial estimates are that their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is aiming for a World Cup medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was a long time in the stomach of biathlete Julian Eberhard.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up on the lost gold medal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old the near-catch medal at the Pyeongchang Olympics.
Seven tenths of a second to go in the end for bronze.
"I have deliberately taken time to process this", says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but I just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the lost precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the Constitution, to win something.
You have to strike at some point.
The World Championship track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "The track has already closed in my heart", he recalls he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) in the last World Cup winter.
He finished second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbo-charged rate
Time is extremely limited and the number of scheduled hearings is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in full swing, Republicans in the U.S. Senate are trying to secure a slim majority for controversial judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing charges of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that date back more than 30 years.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's cultural battle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and first lady Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer uttered angry tirades against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was expected to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative Supreme Court justice.
The Republican majority seemed to be safe when, contrary to his original announcement, Senator Jeff Flake suddenly announced that he would agree but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called the severe remarks on Thursday "shit", initially refrained from further attacks on the women and spoke instead of "happiness in misery".
He said that this would remove any last doubt.
Later, at a rally, Trump lashed out at the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
The White House has also severely restricted the powers of the investigators.
The well-known allegations of two women will be investigated specifically, but that's all a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They're not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1, according to the municipality.
It's also where the federal school district is.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after the win against Mainz:
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area", said the sporting director of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, the Kings were still able to take a 1-0 lead over the Rhine horses and thus secure their first victory of the season.
It could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf on the 11th gave the team security from head coach Domenico Tedesco, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing point of view"., obviously, the head played a more and more important role as the playing time increased.
Don't actually create a head-ball monster.
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me", Heidel said. "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to let it go and withdrew further and further.
And defended Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all felt a huge pain in our hearts", said Schöpf, who had a significant part to play in the incident with his headball hit. "I'm actually the worst headball player in the team".
But in the end, all that matters is winning.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.
"We wanted to start the initial phase with a strong start and make a fireworks show out of it", said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played smart, calm and brave, so we have to approach games over 90 minutes.
Perhaps the biggest flaw of the afternoon, the king's blue missed the opportunity to make things clearer.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the plate twice in 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a victory of trembling", Tedesco said. "You have already felt the fear a little".
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only Schalker with that.
Fish Bachau: Smoke column in the Leitzchtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be missed.
A hiker in the Leitzchtal saw a fire about 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fish Bachau - The cause was soon discovered by police and firefighters: An unknown person had set fire to a two-square-meter area of garbage on Gschwendner Berg.
Police said it appeared he had been watching the fire for a long time, then left the flame unattended.
And that's near the woods.
Thirty fisherman were busy dismantling and extinguishing the fire.
The police are investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion on an equal footing
They are in front of the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have been trying for many years to bring interesting people to Greven", explains the founder and chairman of the Reckenfelder Treff - the association that cooperates with the Alliance for Cultural Policy in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very casually, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a clear way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and a bit of humor, he brings one of the most contentious issues to the audience: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table is German society, at the other the first-generation migrants.
Their children are growing up in Germany and they want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been at the big table and now they want to participate.
It leads to conflict.
He stressed that the decisive question was not whether one was politically on the right or left, but rather: 'Am I for or against an open society?'
At first, he behaves rather, then the discussion round starts more and more.
And there is a need to talk.
An Afghan refugee tells from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see students successfully or unsuccessfully integrating.
El-Mafaalani is a symbol of the debate, not on stage, but in front of us.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stressing that he is speaking of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions", says El-Mafaalani.
He was also open to questions from the guests during the subsequent signing session and was also discussed intensively in the foyer, with Kurdish specialties prepared.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have ended the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away win.
Giossen won in a hard fought match in his own home with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble at the beginning of the new season.
Munich had already struggled to 83:77 on Friday against ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby on Saturday against Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots of land
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested persons have applied to buy one of the land plots in Landsham South.
The Municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new development area of Landsham South on the open market.
This is for Mayor Roland Frick.
The application phase is also completed for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
Frick said that about 100 applications had been received.
'Currently under review' for the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the aim is to have the list of applicants for the 20 plots drawn up by the end of the year and to submit it to the municipal council.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 single and double-family houses and four multi-family houses with eight units each are planned to be built on the site south of Landsham.
The development is now almost complete, and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
One plot of land and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
She sells most of it on the open market, 20 lots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses in the community are to be built as affordable housing.
The total number of housing units is 16 and is subsidised by the Free State.
200 people
It is estimated that approximately 200 people will be housed in the newly built Landsham South area.
Not only that, but now, at the beginning of October, Frick says, the start is being made for the construction of a new day care center.
The project will house three kindergartens and three groups of nurseries, as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, to mark the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo's "big sport" succeeds on the bench.
For the third time in a row, he is not in the starting lineup, but he is grateful to Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat on the bench for the third time in a row, many people would have been very understanding if the almost two-meter tall Brazilian had spoken out about his frustration.
But when the Schalke players gathered in the midfield as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, stepped in and said; "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport", Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve status, held no grudge.
Naldo, who was named the best player last season, probably knows that he didn't actually get on the sidelines with his coach - but he's getting a break for good reason.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It was not easy to tell him, I'll tell you honestly", Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo he was not in the starting lineup.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the cause, it's about the club", Tedesco explained.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can take a breath right now.
And that we all keep in the boat", Tedesco explained the rotation, which last caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself an exemplary team player even on the bench.
The sentiment in Austrian industry continued to accelerate in August compared with the euro area.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) was at 46.7 points, a 37-month low.
Austria still has the third best sentiment in Europe, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50 mark, which indicates growth, for the 13th consecutive month.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final place was taken by Greece (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March at 44.0 points.
"While the slight decline may mean the worst is over", said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains - at least in the third quarter - the number one growth driver.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area fell at their lowest level since November 2011.
The companies therefore reduced their workforce for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, industrial production also fell more sharply in August than initially expected.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index draws its figures from representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
The data show, inter alia, developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices.
Tuchel's PSG team wins the eighth league game
The Commission shall be assisted by the Member States.
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel is racing to win every game with Paris Saint-Germain in the French championship.
At OGC Nice, the title defender won with 3:0 (1:0) thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
The last time Olympique Lyon in France had made such a good start to the season was 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and made the final score in the second half.
The 2:0 in the meantime was Christopher Nkunku (46).
Paris also qualified for the groundbreaking second Champions League group stage match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the first round, Tuchel's team had to accept the only official defeat of the season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
