This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but also shows details that fossils usually do not have, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathered coat was chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other features for feathers  spokes and sleeves  the scientists assumed that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development like the other relevant functions.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was not used for flying, but rather for temperature control or appearance.
The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a dinosaur, the specimen showed the feathered coat of an adult and not a chicken's down.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was hunting for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon affects gravity on Earth, and thus causes tides, the Milky Way affects the Milky Way with its forces.
The researchers concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in a similar way to ordinary matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a form of glory, made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll came across the tuberculosis (XDR-TB) that was particularly resistant to medicine in the southern African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected by the bacterium at the hospital and at least two of them were health workers.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 of his or her close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire population of tuberculosis appears to be low; 6000 out of a total of 330 000 persons infected in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters enter a box alone, laying a pre-printed sheet on paper indicating their candidate's choice in a envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the voting box and signs the call for votes.
French electoral law has a fairly strict codification of the judicial proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that electors and observers can attest that no ballot box is present at the start of the vote and that no ballot box is added except those that are carefully counted and those that are approved by the electorate.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process, and during the evening, the votes are tallied by volunteers according to specific procedures and under strict control.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop".
The target is named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, said police officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
Emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh's court for killing his son.
She is being held in custody and awaiting trial, but any eyewitnesses may have been affected since her image has been much in the public eye.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, so that courts consider the publication of images as potentially harmful to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes journalists seem to hang in a thin thread if they publish images etc. of suspects.
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution, that no further comments will be made before the arraignment.
The document, according to the leak, refers to the territorial boundaries, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the themes addressed.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to let this force remain for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental damage control were closely monitored by forest rangers, which led to the monitoring of the trial and its evaluation.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters for the first shoot operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new election council (CEP) on 9 members yesterday.
It's actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the former CEP (Haiti's election commission) as part of a package of measures to drive the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose from the lack of elections, some of which had been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing four minor injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been clear about 27 accidents related to the facilities.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 local time (19:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication that a tsunami was coming.
A Filipino man who had previously been a policeman, has held tourists in Hong Kong as prisoners by hijacking their bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the old, as well as the Philippine photographers, were released early.
Photographers took over the seat of an old woman who needed to use the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a medical career.
He trained as a birth doctor and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Liggins began to investigate premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would increase the rate of development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that state investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other brewers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first boss, Luna died on the night of the two moons, quite unique, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was as rare as me...maybe even more so...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
The temporary Secretary of State Julia Gillard claimed in the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the polling shares this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II as Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim both the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the three stages during the Commonwealth Games, but due to the allegations, doubts have been raised about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known primes to date on January 25.
Several individuals verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported Tuesday.
Comets may have been the cause of water on Earth, as well as ecological matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially with Earth in mind.
Cuomo, 53, began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as political shenanigans and stupidity.
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes and annually save a lot of fuel and formine carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology that allows air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put in, trains over the ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-term facilities are inaccessible on the ground.
The possibility of being forced to play behind closed doors without the team's supporting players was raised due to fear of lack of transportation.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden informed that new species had evolved in just two generations, though many had thought that this process would take much longer due to the interbreeding of endemic Darwinfink, Mellomjordspurv, and the cactus spurve-invasion of the Great Cactus spurve.
Gold can come in all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can also be twinned and braided, and it can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and attach itself to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as a decoration in the hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cider will change color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is marked by the number of hydrogenions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogenions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels weird and creates a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a water closet attached to an advanced sewer system.
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, toilets were also found in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a gigantic rocket of over 100 British feet to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in great ways, and the best thing it has given us is a much simpler and faster means of transportation.
It has given us many transportation devices such as the train, the car and more.
Under them, there are several medium-sized caterpillars that eat medium-sized prey such as hares to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are several small caterpillars (including loose pet cats) that eat the far more numerous prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success is the niche concept, a special job for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species and live together in larger groups called alliances.
The alliances consist of 13 adult males in a mating pair, together with up to thirty females and puppies.
The females are usually closely related to each other, since they constitute a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion flock behaves much like a wolf or dog flock, animals that have surprisingly much in common with the behavior of lions (but not other large cats).
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump over great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not the full-grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence with glittered words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (bythds) by sniffing, sniffing, sniffing on the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came, for example, if they move over a mountain area or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different functions or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the new people begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they look less and less like the other population.
After a few thousand years or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We have named this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans inhale, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (so it's just breathing well).
Plants feed from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals would not survive without plants.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurus.
The long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper mouth, none of which crossed its path alive from it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a false tongue, and it may have been fed by turtles, big fish, other mosaic fish, and it may have been a cannibal.
In addition, it would attack anything that came down into the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not be a match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast goods, including wild boars, poultry, snails and a type of rodent called the syvsovere.
The fact that poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, while the rich men liked to have banquets together where they lay on their side while eating their meals, was another difference.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that came to Europe from the United States or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn or tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no older Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each god and these were seen as the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
Houses were not so essential in the high-temperate climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived mostly out in the open.
Women made their food in the garden; shops were open disks facing the street, and houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land around Canaan, making the timber extremely expensive.
In Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been deported from Iceland for murder, and found Greenland while travelling westward and named it Greenland.
But there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time, independent of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though all the countries were skandinaviske.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although it is written on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776 is inscribed on the back of the document, up and down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So the notation was probably added as a label.
The invasion and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French Vichy individuals, French persons who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The invasion of 15 August 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called Operation Dragoon.
Within just two weeks, the Americans and free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large number of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, linked to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this thus defines in a certain way the size of society.
A civilization culture presupposes the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a linguistic footprint and a fair and lasting mediation.
Minor cultures disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not seen as proper civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with the Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or judicial system, it was dependent on state agencies, which were usually unwilling to cooperate in enforcing their actions.
Nor did it have the authority to overrule the tax law and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended, and the states took so lightly on the central government that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian and German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fekting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 are well-liked sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in geographical contexts, as an  group of islands.
Taiwan's origins go back to the 14th century when European seafarers passing through the island gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and started up with an overlay to the indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work their rice and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took Taiwan's coastal areas in the west and north under control in 1683, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which ceded the rights of Taiwan to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three important structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was completed in 1976 and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still image photography in the world, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but even more important is that the digital camera's image sensor formats have inherited the size ratio of the camera.
It might be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio), is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family formats) are similar, or approximate, to this aspect ratio.
The triding rules are often misused and ridiculated, but are a simple guideline that creates dynamics while having a measure for order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main motif is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined during this period of European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had bound together European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervading authority affected everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth is to be used to diminish pain and poverty and that is why the money of the church is there.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy demonstrated the effect of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified through several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain bombed international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire portions of the sea, creating danger even to neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare as there was limited response to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most inhabitants and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having seen all the fear and cruelty of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for Edison's firm in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of reference from Charles Batchelor (the jobbleder from his previous position) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces, the best-known of these periods being the three kingdoms that took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was a violent warfare between many kings who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, as thousands of people died while fighting for the seat of power in the great palace at Xiadel.
There are some social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation is ruled by the citizens instead of just one ruler.
After the revolution, too, it was open to all male seekers, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the military, because instead of military rank systems that were based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was a motivation for other oppressed people in the working classes of other nations to also start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that go beyond mortal life, and he often used a cave known as Hira on the mountain Noor (light), where he went to think.
The cave itself, preserved over the years, provides a very vivid representation of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On a mountain top north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It's not really easy to find at all, even if you know it's there, because once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid at Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes many pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), many small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinxen.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The uppercase symbol resembles a V and the lowercase symbol resembles a pencil or square without a bottom.
Up means you should start on the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start on the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more definite.
You can use a pencil and make your own markings, but don't forget that the printed bowing markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be taken into account as a rule.
The terrified royal family, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were pressed on October 6, 1789 to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
The King and Queen returned to Paris in a chariot surrounded by a crowd shouting and shouting threats against them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
A member of the gang at one time swung the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people had to pay for the cost of the war's American imperialism, in the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover large parts of the costs, and the interest on bonds was paid in the name of the Philippine government through the banks on Wall Street.
The super-revenue from the exploitation of the Filipino people was a fundamental gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the formation of the order.
The age in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history that is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire did not interfere with social culture and traditions for most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralized and uniformed rules.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that the road development is due to the car.
A nationwide road network is not economically viable if it is used by only a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce costs in road conditions.
Massive car accidents are a major cause of road accidents, leading to new methods in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romantism had a larger element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
What characterized Romanticism was that the landscape shaped individuals and that over time geographical habits and cultures arose, and that these, as they harmonized with the position in society, were better than casual laws imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in our time, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known for being an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status of the city was not the same in the 12th century, mainly because of the Crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were priced more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title as motehovedstad was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But due to slow communication channels, the West could hang on for 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style, and one of the major changes that occurred at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to close clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-growing agriculture is a simple, often ecological, system that uses stored seeds belonging to the area combined with growth rotation or other techniques to maximize relatively simple yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in self-sufficiency agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded from social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be special because of the age, ethnicity, class, area and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes mannerisms, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not sufficiently socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Some children have been kept in captivity by humans (usually their own parents), in some cases due to the rejection of the parents by a child's serious intellectual or physical weaknesses.
It is possible that children who are wild may have undergone serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to escape.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is fully raised by animals, it develops behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the animal it is raised from, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Although project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, stillasbygging takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that supports individuals who undergo a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
A teacher can also be, in other words, a form of stillas, but it's also the little bindersman in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions are embedded in the software and are intended to ask questions, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an atmosphere that is not caring and educational, but it does happen.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they did not have in the home they came from.
It is a combination of elements with both mass and interpersonal communication on the Internet.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to extra dimensions in relation to the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, learning and socialization are considered to be important motivational factors for internet use (James and others, 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified personal engagement and permanent relationships as new motivation aspects when they investigated audiences' reactions to websites (1998).
Using video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been argued that one can find out whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his newspaper, The President's Tale, that people who fail to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to assess sincerity correctly.
He also argues that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
Modern research has identified two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new gene variation and the selection removes it from the selection of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination switch back and forth between the two basins with each generation.
It's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to get enough amino acids from the available plant resources out on the savannah.
And the consequences of not doing so are devastating: stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and berries would be the most accessible plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them first.
Animal foods (mouse, termites, eggs) are in contrast not only easily digestible, but they also provide high quantity proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem with a method quite similar to that of the chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Sleep deprivation is the process of consciously awakening during the normal sleep period while falling back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a rather quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known watering agent) before sleeping, which causes one to have to stand up to urinate.
How much inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with how much tension there is in the body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stops us from getting that kind of insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded to include the love-orientation of the mahayana and several methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and full love.
Kundalini energy can be awakened with kundalini yoga through yoga poses, breathing, mantra and visualization.
Tibetan meditation is about god yoga, the channels of energy are cleansed through the vision of different deities, the chakras are activated and the consciousness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, causing cooperation between the USSR and the United States. The clashes between system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out towards the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would really be fought, by proxy armies on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places in Africa to Asia.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the last opportunity was to return and reorganise along Romania.
However, these plans were aborted almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Peace Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this, as the Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
The German navy tried to stop this traffic, mostly by using submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
It began with ancient cultures and tribes keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Inland goats were generally kept in flocks that strolled on hills or other places for grazing, usually tended by goat herders who were often children or youths, similar to the more well-known shepherd.
Carriageways in England were built as early as the 1500s.
Although the wagonways were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull themselves to achieve greater speeds and to pull more cargo than on the slightly more rugged roads of the time.
To keep the spores in place, the cross-skin was introduced early, but little by little it was realized that the spores were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the squeegee created more wear on the three-wheelers of the wagons.
The three-wheeled carriage was replaced with a steel one, and in 1767 the first full-iron skins were introduced.
Spasering was the first known means of transportation. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) grew up.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked with two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and two-legged specialization has been discovered in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.23.9 million years ago.
We can start by having a lifestyle that is more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to some degree to mitigate the coming pain.
This is often just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should remove them.
The world has changed a lot with the scientific and technological advances of humans, and the difficulties have become more complicated due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
A handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and general secretary Charles Thomson and then sent some quarters away to the printer John Dunlap after its introduction by Congress on July 4.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night and these are now known as the Dunlap-broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One arrived at George Washington on July 6, and was read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document, although the first copy that was written by hand has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and live on today  they are called birds.
Some people don't look at them as real dinosaurs since they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of a dinosaur.
They have feet with shells and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
So almost all the PCs that are used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits  or bits, to use data jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally insufficient for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine containers or toxic household items in the premises.
For first aid instructions specific to the particular poison, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from an old connection with midd, insects highly adapted to attack humans.
Both Assassin insects and Bed-insects are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or the house of their host.
As far as we know, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research is actually governed by this method.
Experimentation is not alone, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by asking questions.
Naturalistic philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view of all things scientific, including psychology, was accepted.
When Greek knowledge became worse, the West became more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that can be seen in physiology and behavior are as a rule entirely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been demonstrated by virtually all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and not just as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-moving oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first proposals to claim that DNA could be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two attempts to mark either the DNA in the phosphorus-radiated phage or the protein of the sulfur-radiated phage.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the mutation type, the significance of the genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are bacterioclineal cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of place activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and exploring details of the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village, the others drive away.
In this dynamic transport fleet, everyone is somehow connected to, and dependent on, a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that the large carbon economy has loosened the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and most people are dissatisfied with transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems produce such dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicles' movements between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is complicated to study traffic flow, since it is impossible to predict the behaviour of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with some consistency so that the traffic flow remains fairly consistent and can be mathematically calculated with a reasonable degree of safety.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three important properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with planning, design and operation of the driving system.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food and make friends.
Most insects benefit from the ability to spread their wings backward along their body.
Because of this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold back their wings are the eyed-squirrels and the blue-eyed fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus thought that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river, with more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, measuring ten kilometers across in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows out of the earth's crust into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is the Amazon River, which is 6,387 miles (3,980 km) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramids were still built in stone until the ancient Egyptian Empire ended, they never exceeded the size and technical execution of the pyramids of Giza.
Egyptians of the New Kingdom of the Old Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City State has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by the Vatican in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used in the daily life of state employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen of the Vatican is Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had theories that everything involves a mixture of one or more of the earth's four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in the same order): fluid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there's a variety of elements on the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that a few trillion of them fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a great help to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been downgraded in status and usage.
People are now writing messages on PC screens, and never getting close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that in order to put together a nucleus with more protons and neutrons, energy is required.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, splitting the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to fall apart more or less unprovoked.
The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The scarp is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the side.
They are thinner under the maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible that there's more magma on the side opposite us, because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they become more mature and approach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about individuals that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
As a rule, two behavioural patterns emerge when leaders begin to lead their former colleagues.
For this type of leader, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, to take disciplinary action, to conduct performance reviews, to assign responsibility and to hold people accountable.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels he or she must change absolutely everything that the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, it is the manager who is responsible for the team's victory or defeat.
This often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more self-government than ordinary team members, as their teams can find ways to meet according to many different time zones, which the local management may not always understand.
An usynlig team that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p 109) is also a unique element in a virtual team.
The invisible group is the management group to which each member reports, and sets the standard for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organisation, creativity and innovation can emerge.
The process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to new innovative processes that can help to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create an innovation culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way of providing assistance to organizations to improve performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, reducing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The interplay between brain pathology and behavior is a confirmation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas and tumors affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we've never seen before are now possible to study thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that go on in our brains.
Although AI gives a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, handling behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control and planning of the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting analysis, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on coming up with solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and defense, built into several home PCs and computer game software.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and teachers usually love to take students to places where a bus tour is not possible.
Technology provides a solution with virtual excursions, where students can observe museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
A great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes is to share the trip virtually.
For example, students from the Bennet school in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the capital city, every year the website is restructured, but old versions are kept on the web to be used as a clipbook.
Blogging can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience will generally change that.
The blog author began to improve his writing to avoid criticism, as students are often the most critical audience.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more up-to-date with the world around them". The need to give the desired to the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates students to work together, and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the typical school day they've been through.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively reacting to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others, and sketch their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with several art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present-day.
Further south is Niagara Falls and to the north, in Muskoka and further out, one finds untouched nature in all its beauty.
All of this and more shows Ontario what outsiders consider to be genuine Canadian.
Large areas to the north are very sparsely populated and in some places are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of the population that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Kapp route from Europe to India.
In the north, it is bounded by the Sahel, in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that travelling ladies state that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to go with a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they will see as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, taken in the arms etc.
Be determined to say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yours (cultural differences or not, that still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The city we know as Casablanca today was founded in the tenth century BC, and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans and the Maronites.
The Portuguese demolished it, and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan built the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca because of the Spanish merchants who had set up their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping spots in all of Morocco.
Places where traditional Moroccan goods are available, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hot guns and a whole spectrum of geisha, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the east of the country near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which led to the demolition of most of the city's streets, especially its downtown.
Although Goma is quite safe, any visit outside Goma should be read in advance to understand the struggles going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing up the volcano Nyiragongo, along with some of the most scenic mountain tours to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) which costs about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Timbuktu has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Although Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat of the sands, it was added in 1990 to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
It was one of the stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-east South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is the southern border.
The park is 19 500 km2 and can be divided into 14 different ecological zones, which support different wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and is considered the most beautiful national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card (a ticket), which gives access to either a selection of parks, or all national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists consider as their main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering stolpediagram that is clearly visible thanks to the floodwaters that make up Victoria Harbor.
If you want the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The major part of Hong Kong Island's urban development is tightly packed with rebuilding land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest beach zone on the planet is the Sundarbans, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that is within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps - here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle that once covered the giant plains.
Sundarbans consists of an area of 3 850 km2 with about one third of the area covered by water and peat.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 bengal tigers and around 30 000 sharks in the area.
Buses run from the bus terminal (over the river) throughout the day, despite the fact that most, especially those buses going eastward and to Jakar/Bumthang, travel between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small, comfortable, and solid Japanese coast buses serve most districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapok River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres high and have two arches of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (59 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be in full operation from September 2017, when the brasilianske tollsjekkpunkten are expected to be ready.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group, they were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups such as the guaycurú and the payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 1500s, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Provinces of the Indies", became a country as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with the native population.
The three-century colonization period was started by the Spanish.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has maintained much of its city's character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the poloban in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See Asosiacion Argentina de Polo for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for half-time games.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands, whose value is equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands and within the Stanley credit card and US dollar are also often accepted.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It's difficult to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so make sure to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; in summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
The cold can be misleading in winter, as the temperature rarely goes below the freezing point, but a combination of wind and humidity causes it to feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There is no particular rainfall and dryfall seasons:- the amount of rainfall is the same throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but still, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
You should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, according to the park authorities, and 25 yards away from all other wild animals!
Bison, elk, deer, bear, and almost any large animal can attack no matter how peaceful they may look.
Every year, tens of thousands of visitors are injured because they haven't kept a proper distance, these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly meals and keep a clean environment.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor in 1889, it became the notorious site of the Sea Protest.
Except for one British cruiser, all ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting led to the assassination of its leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The Auckland's two harbours are bordered by beaches, the most popular of which are three.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbor District are located in the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north  to Devonsport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes you find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
The most important local beer is Nummer one, which is not a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines that should be tested, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may fare better.
The local spring water is safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cacao is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juice is expensive, but it's fantastic.
Many trips to the reef occur year-round and damage due to some of these things is rare.
Nevertheless, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and follow safety warnings closely.
Boksmanets occur near beaches and near rivers from October to April north of 1770.
There are sharks, but it's unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean, but in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind since they now have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although there may be opportunities to book lodges in other areas, such as on a camping site, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often sell packages including breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even packages with airplane and hotel.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your agreement (such as a visa).
Diverse changes or requests should be made via the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of the festival guards decide to camp at the site, and most guards consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be near the place where it happens, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night even though the music on the main stage is finished.
At some festivals there are special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are going to cross the North Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as driving through ice causes extreme noise for those most affected.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment for the guests, so that they will be in good spirits and will want to stay at the place.
Some arenas offer free alcoholic beverages, but alcohol impairment impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in the high country or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or cold.
The friction is low, so on ice and snow you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, you may fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is mostly continuous all year round.
Safari is perhaps the largest form of tourism that draws tourists to Africa and is the main attraction for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage denotes travel to the land to see the beautiful African wildlife, specifically on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to get close to cars and standard equipment, which will allow good viewing angles.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be quite shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "busk walking" or "balance walking") involves walking for several hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August 2021 to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held elsewhere around Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, hosting the 1964 Games.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you can apply.
The rules of cancellation vary, but since the end of March, the rules of cancellation will not be extended to July 2020, as the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, and typical tickets with prices around ¥7000.
It may help to iron damp clothing to get them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, although it is not on the premises.
If a hair dryer is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing threaded socks, you may try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are various ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if in doubt, you can buy the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may come across contagious animal diseases that they do not know from their home areas.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or further infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that are capable of harming or killing humans with their force, are usually not qualified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased at certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway are the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often passes through isolated backwoods.
If you are used to driving on country roads, keep your head cool: there are many steep climbs, narrow roads and sharp curves.
The speed limits set are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections  usually 3540 US miles per hour (5664 km/h)  and it is even more important to respect them than otherwise.
Strangely enough, the cell coverage is much better here than along many other places along the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are very tasty, and in Bavaria they are full and varied, comparable to the baked goods of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit baked is common, with baked apples year round, and cherry and plum have their entré in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts that grow on trees.
If you want some small but filling pastries, try the one that is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid in the dish, a carrier may be dry or moist.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yoghurt is regularly used in curries, while coconut milk is commonly used in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a paraply, covering a wide range of regional cuisines across the nation.
If used without additional pegs, however, the term usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly spiced dishes, with a dominant flavor of peanuts, chili, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stigboths hang down on each side of the hall and are supports for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but may be less safe due to the possibility of a rider becoming sitting tight.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged after the horse if it runs away.
Most riders use riding boots with a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some halls, especially English halls, have safety rods that allow the leather of the stigbølen to fall down from the hall if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as South America's Yosemite, with many large walls and granite crags.

The snow sport in outback, which includes both skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves riding down on snow-covered areas with skis or snowboards that are attached to the feet.
Skiing is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bombers", who plan entire holidays around going on skiing at a particular place.
The idea of standing on skis is very old.  cave paintings depict skigåers dating back to as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 16th century, when the first Nordic ski club was opened in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking on ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include, alpine style skiing, or alpine climbing, the latter of which is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski lift as something of the same as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk  but it is very rare you will achieve great speeds without a heavy backpack in the track.
Europe is a fairly small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several nations will involve more visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, functions as a single country in this respect.
As long as you are within this zone, you can generally cross borders without passing through passport checkpoints again.
At the same time, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country if you have a Schengen visa, and you therefore save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what kind of artifacts are antiquities. Some tax agencies consider artifacts older than 100 years to be antiquities.
The definition has geographical differences, including the age limit being lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques despite being newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami and is also important for the trade culture of many other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sami have been involved in reins in large scale, they lived from fishing, hunting and the like, while reins were mostly used as draught animals.
In modern times, many of the Sámi work in modern occupations, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although the word Gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, it is often considered to be unfint due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate impressions of the Romanian people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are planning to travel to, it may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult with authorities other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and simple compared to the more detailed information elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very severe weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, severe social consequences or loss of human life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires are the effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, thunderstorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather events include snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of storms affecting their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Those planning to visit countries that are considered to be war zones should receive professional training.
An Internet search for hostile environmental courses will likely come up with the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the problems mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involve acting, some first aid, and occasionally training with weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travellers planning sex-correction operations abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return home.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to fit with a desired name or gender vary.

Preoperative trans people don't have to assume that they can get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning stream of waves that breaks on the beach, a reef, or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated to some deeper sections, and a rapid flow so that deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion during attempts to swim backward against the current, which can be very problematic.
Once you get out of the current, it's no more problematic than swimming back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be dragged back or, depending on your skill and whether you've been noticed, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
A returshock occurs earlier than a culture shock (the stress phase is not there in the same way as with exodus), it lasts longer, and can become more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adapt to their own culture again.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that the traveler will have to adjust to a new land.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting things for kids is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night and you have the opportunity to see them in peace before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here. The story of the sound and the light is just like a fairy tale.
The Sphinxen is set both as a backdrop and as the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Island is claimed by several countries and has the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The island is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is Kong George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a volcano that is still active provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then they reappear and form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountain Range, bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
Mount Vinson-toppen has an elevation of 4892 metres and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, in the northern part or Sentinel Range.
In remote areas with limited mobile coverage, satellite telephones may be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot replace a mobile phone, as one must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to take a phone.
The service is often used by ships, recreational boats and in addition to expeditions that have remote data and contact needs.
You can obtain more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Travel education is an increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a gap year.
This is especially popular among Russians, so that they can take a year off before university, without weakening their education.
In many cases, taking a year off abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually, there will be a school office to be registered in this type of education program.
Finland is a great destination for boaters. The land of a thousand islands also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastguard.
A yacht is not necessary in the island groups and lakes.
Although the shoreline and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak are a different experience.
The boat life is a national pastime in Finland with a boat per 7th or 8th person.
Although this is the same for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is quite unique (as in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
The vast majority of the distinct Baltic Cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of whole days in the historic city, and go back to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions, you will not need your own visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.

Freight companies get paid a lot of money to deliver things quickly, and time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for smaller companies it was problematic.
If they sent things by air freight, it may have taken days on some routes to get through the outlays and the toll booths.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without passengers, and that's where you come into the picture.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to fork out a big fat pile of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This, however, is not reasonable: as a rough rule of thumb, you can prepare to pay up to four times the standard economy fare for business class, and eleven times the fare for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for business rebates or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a certain group of people who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and then pay.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Rumanian is the local language, but Russian is also widely used.
The multiethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in East Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

In the north, you must also visit the heavily-covered Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site of Marian art popular worldwide.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave, as well as a place that has an almost immeasurable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the place with the dignity, the solemnity and the respect it deserves, and don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Please do not damage the area by marking or tearing graffiti into structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population likes Catalan, and most of them understand it, but practically all speak Spanish.
Most signs are, however, only shown in Catalan because it is officially recognised as the first official language.
Spanish is also used in public transportation and other facilities.
Ordinary messages on the Metro station are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.

The fast façade of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a little basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by a lot of forest, mainly of beech, grass and grassland, and is characterized by a mixture of high mountain and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soil and varying levels of elevation.
The area is also home to a very large number of animals and birds.
There you will rarely find such fauna as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, gaupe, wildcat and tiur, in addition to several common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer a shawl to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially if it has bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men are required to wear trousers that go over the knees.
These may also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes may not be washed after each use, so it may be less comfortable to go in these skirts.
Mallorca's cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially flax), and uses olive oil for everything.
A light and well-liked dinner, at least in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: a disc with olive oil, tomato and any accessories such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns that are used together with the word Sie for you always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.

Since light pollution was not the type of problem in their heyday as it is today, they usually find themselves in cities or at study sites that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms displayed have been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.

Many of the traditions that we have in the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake through the Easter night at an exposed point to see the sunrise.
It may have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but there are also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Many traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday evening in the Easter holiday, with congresses often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The pets were unable to make the journey due to the long distance to the continent, and the large land-dwelling ground sloth became the first beited animal on the Galapagos.
Many mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
Since the places are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
