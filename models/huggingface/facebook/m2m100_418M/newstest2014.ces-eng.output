A black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are struggling to find money for repairs of collapsing highway networks, many begin to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car’s instrument board.
Facilities that track every kilometre the driver misses and that transmit this information to the authorities are the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and the state planning authorities to renovate the outdated system of funding of the U.S. main roads.
Usually, the fade design of highways suddenly triggered intense debate and the formation of a variety of associations.
The Libertarians gathered together with groups of ecologists and lobbyed for the government to use these small boxes that would record the missed kilometers and even where you’re going – and then this information would be used to set up a tax measurement.
The tea party is terrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states do not expect anything.
They find out how in the next decade they can move to the system in which the driver pays for the kilometer of the road that he goes.
Thousands of drivers have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, to test.
This is a real need for our people.
“It’s not a matter where we can choose the power,” said Hasan Ikhrata, the executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who plans to start tracking the missed kilometers for each California motorist by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The incentive is the fact that the Road Trust Fund funded from the taxes that Americans pay for the gas stations is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much fuel as before.
Car runs a lot more kilometers per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians refuse to raise the tax by just one cent.
“Bensin tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking facility in 500 cars to test this payment system for the missed kilometer.
“In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometers spent.
It is no surprise that this idea likes urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change drivers’ behavior patterns, which can, for example, help to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas production.
California designers look at this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (the representative of Pennsylvania), the Chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for the missed kilometers.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 encouraged Congress to move towards paying per kilometer.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project, which was expected to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives’ leadership rejected the proposal and did so due to the concerns of rural legislators representing the population, whose daily life often means offending many kilometers for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The worst is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon begin to pay tax to the state for the missed kilometers, instead of the gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do this in a limited degree for trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministries, along with the coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept has no only supporters.
In Nevada, where recently the facility was equipped with about 50 volunteer cars, drivers were worried that the government was able to monitor each of their movements.
“The concerns regarding Big Brother tracking and similar matters were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, the management strategy and operations at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It was not something people wanted.
As the experimental project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to transform these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.”
There is no need to build an enormous, heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably extend to the record of daily departure and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers the car finds, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be more quiet.
The hunt for such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real taken distance).
This company was initially not involved in the government’s aid in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging legal liability insurance market, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they will go.
But this device, which it tries, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only provides a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to do so if you don’t track their speed and location,” says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
A number of major errors occurred in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and fewer ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers experiment with the fact that they give drivers a choice.
You can choose a device with GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not need to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of kilometers spent by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places they hope that a cautious public will approach this concept if the facility will know more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a taxation facility that would be equipped in such a way that it would also be possible to pay parking hours fees, to provide insurance according to the kilometers taken and to collect data about the speed of other drivers so that drivers can avoid traffic constipation.
“Motorists will be willing to engage in this due to the value of the benefits they offer,” the project document of the city says.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all discussions about paying per kilometer are not just a huge representative problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Committee in the Gulf of San Francisco say Congress could easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the gasoline tax.
One-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for any radical operation when rich enough to take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee for Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating.
Social democracy is shaking, the people and grandmothers are talking together and planning a common process.
If the social-democratic parties are over a few weeks, they will meet at the negotiation table with perfectly gathered partners, who will put on the table a complete list of demands including ministry positions.
The members of the CSSD will either sweat the acidic coalition grains, or swallow on the wreckful minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days, when he carried on a wave of sympathy, hit for the first time.
Yesterday he failed to control the political grammy and mainly forced the convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only he, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I have apologized to the members of the group and now to the citizens.
You don’t lie in your personal life or in the public.
“It was a mistake,” said after the meeting of the closest social-democratic leadership Michal Hašek.
He added that he was not in the first vice president.
“My decision will be announced on the 10th of November,” Hašek said.
The same was stated by the deputy chairman Zdeněk Škromach and the chairman of the parliamentary club Jeroným Tejc.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
The two members said they would do everything to ensure that the 50 members of the CSSD sounded with one vote.
To the absurd theater, the crown was placed by Michal Hašek with a phrase: "I am a member of the CSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party bodies."
Another lie in direct broadcast.
Or maybe when he called for Sobotkov’s resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August UAV with 57 percent decided that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party’s candidate for the prime minister?
However, the head of the CSSD, by calling the UAV until the next Sunday, made a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a snorkeling of a variety of thumbs and rumors, eventually reminding the real mistakes of Sobotkov's political career.
The dirty clothes will be strongly washed, the signs of dark alliances between the carbon baron Zdeňk Bakala and the Sobotkovy wing will appear.
It will discuss the friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radk Pokorny.
There are disputes in Morocco and Morocco.
The warning is the words of Ostrava's mayor and Sobotkov's ally Peter Kajnara: "I signed the Charter 77 so that the country should not be ruled by idiots."
If the UAV had gathered this weekend, liars would probably be forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The betrayalers will throw their heads with ash and stay.
And now the winning chief of the CSSD then ends with the surname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on the problems with the OH in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth will indicate a small smile and then he only breathe deeply: "It's challenging."
The collaboration with the organizing team of the 2014 Sochi Olympics is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
What happened at the Olympics, we can forget.
“Nothing works the same,” the head of the Czech Olympic mission said.
What exactly is happening?
Many things work slowly and not so accurately.
It is so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information about essential things, they are not so much.
For example, for three months we have liked them to add us how the individual villages will be officially marked, so that we can do a whole range of things according to that.
We’re still waiting and they’re still saying they’re communicating the matter.
They always communicate in a number of things.
Is the Olympic Village already built?
This is no longer a disaster.
A month ago, we went through empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are worth.
What does it mean that they are empty?
Do you need ready floors?
Basic concrete, that is how it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that until the 26th of January we come there as a preview, there will still be a feeling of adhesive.
And if they didn’t, what would it be?
Would President Putin say that he would go to the army?
That is exactly how it will happen.
The Olympic Village is the Olympic Village.
It is more likely that they do not get, for example, the adjustment of the roads, do not make details.
Maybe they’ll have roads in such a state that we’ll have to take with us the holes from the London Games.
I think they’re going to get it somewhat.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
The number is now approximately 78, although the number varies depending on the nomination criteria.
For example, the crocodiles will probably go in the three that they have gone out.
No one has to doubt about Martin Sáblíkové as well, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you on the way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26th.
How will the Olympic Village look, we know.
We’ve even measured some things by a meter so that we don’t believe just the drawings.
We are preparing a lot of other things, including transportation.
What does the head of the mission do 100 days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of the individual Olympic sports plus I do a regular agenda in the sense of communication with the organizational committee in Sochi.
Putin promises ecological Olympics, a plan to hurt him enormous secret deposits
Winter sports fans are striking a meter to the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, while others are looking at their preparation with increasing concerns.
The Olympics in Russia, which will start in February, will be a major challenge.
The Russians are not able to fulfill the promise that the preparations and events of the games will not at least disrupt the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go.
Otherwise, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high layer, and the Canadian Games were recorded as the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste" has long been taken.
Reporters of the AP agency last week discovered a giant waste of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Therefore, a waste full of building materials, tyres, canys and insulation pen found in August by the ecologists, which they immediately.
The Russian authorities have disappeared and the waste has disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters saw a storage of three football fields.
It is not the only one, in the area of such places there have been several, the British newspaper The Times described.
The site is operated by the Russian Railways, a state monopoly that builds an approximately six hundred kilometers long route between the Sochi airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close colleagues, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended that the waste was founded by one of the subcontractors.
Local people are desperate.
According to the residents of Achstyr around the village, for three months day and night, trucks full of waste materials have been driving.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu river, other rivers and eventually the Black Sea.
“Water from here will contaminate the sochi water sources for the next ten to fifteen years,” Vladimir Kimaev, a non-profit ecological organization EWNC, told the British newspaper.
Illegal waste is not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison: the games in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing came to $43 billion.
Last year’s London Games cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver Nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that when working on the exhibition of sports and infrastructure, human rights are not respected.
Last month, one of the workers sparked his mouth to protest that he did not get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers under the games deal with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gay at the Olympics.
The young couple mature to housing with their parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates got as a task to design a house on a plot that lies at the corner of two streets, with the land itself somewhat sliding.
The demand was that two generations would want to live together in the house, but each should have their own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly swallowing land.
The architects decided to place each house in one of the floors of the house.
“When we made the proposal, we respected the family bonds, history and memories associated with the place.”
“Three different functions of the house are connected via several ways through the exterior of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but at the same time they have their own privacy,” the designers explain.
The home of the parents is at the level of a garden with an old borovic, to which family traditions and memories are linked.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ by the different final adjustment of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been drawn up using panels from plates, the part where the office is omitted white and the remaining elements remained in pure concrete making without further adjustments.
Many walls of the house are completely glassed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected with the exterior.
The home of parents, more precisely the kitchen, the dining room and the living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that has a great importance for the family.
Connecting the interior to the exterior emphasizes the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
A kitchen room in a young couple’s home.
The young couple enters the house by the main entrance to the hall and from there they then climb the stairs into their spaces.
The stairs are the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to pass through them.
This is the way the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and print something unique to it.
The home of a young couple is considered as one open space with a kitchen part, a dining room and a living room together.
From the terrace it is divided only by a glass wall with moving doors.
A living area with a dining and kitchen part in the young couple’s home.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely passes to the terrace, from which there is a nice view of the Gulf of Tokyo.
The office itself on the top floor is covered in a pure combination of white and black colors.
The stairs are a dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house by the main entrance, find themselves in the entrance hall and from there they climb the stairs upwards.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zemana and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called open letters to students, teachers, and the management of high schools and universities in several districts to defend academic freedoms against the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman in the schools.
I had greater or less success.
The rector of the Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the Honorary Chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received revenge in the form of a non-invitation to the celebration of the state holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of the representatives of the schools who were no longer so courageous and allowed the visit to Miloš Zemana: Higher Technical Learning in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, Ostrava Business School, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
Now we meet in Pardubice with the continuation of the policy promotion at universities.
The newly elected member of the ODS, dekan of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, in addition, it seems normal to him.
This is not the same as if you remain in the position of mayor of a smaller city.
Do you want to be included in the hejtmans of the CSSD, who perform simultaneously the functions of deputy and hejtman and as they degrade both professions?
Thus, you tell people that both of these challenging functions can be managed by the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michal Haška, who manages even several dozen functions at the same time.
This is not an example of the person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňkové, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post in order to be able to fully engage in the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the function of the dekan, however, is that by the course of the functions you violate the apoliticity of the academic field of the University of Pardubice.
The leadership of the Pardubic ODS sees your current activity on both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you’ll be able to help your “school” even without remaining a dekan.
I think the same opinion I have and Rector Miroslav Ludwig, will have your students.
Consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count to you in the next elections.
It doesn’t need to have a long duration.
There is no chemistry in it, no chemistry in it.
More than a thousand tons of acidic cabbage will be produced in the coming months in the Slovak Frut Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season begins in October and will last about a half year.
He has produced a healthy flavour here since 1925 in a traditional way, i.e. sliding directly in large dances.
In modern industries, it is rare.
Our workers are looking for a change of a routes of 10 kilometers.
Each of the ten tanks will include fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, and the filling of one takes three exchanges," said David Kladroba, director of the Slovak Fruta plant.
The grapes of the cabbage are carried into the company’s area directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrozhsk and Břeclavsk.
The employees of Fruty then clean the vegetables, remove the coatings and throw them into the crossing.
From there, the already cut cabbage falls into six-metre deep swimming pools, in which the clothes dressed in white clothes and holes work unhealthy.
This eliminates unwanted air.
The last slated layer of the cabbage is covered with a plate and loaded with water.
“The green crouch will then grow up for six to eight weeks with spontaneous milk vomiting without any addition of substances that support vomiting,” said Kladroba’s director.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, the individual layers of the workers are swallowed with salt and cement.
The grain after the excavation goes to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet acid in bags or glasses and is sterilized.
Hamé supplies acided cabbage primarily to the domestic and Slovak markets.
He is also interested in it in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a spider from the U.S. intelligence services, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to send evidence to the German parliament unless the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander will not be able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and talked with him about the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, which the deputy delivered to the media on Friday in Berlin, it is stated: “Al the outcome of my efforts was proved positively, my government continues to behave to the opposition as to escape and strives to criminalize political manifestations with heavy claims that don’t give room for defense.”
Talking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believes that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to withdraw the charges against him.
The accusations raised by the U.S. Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to the magazine Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to allow it.”
The tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to rise when the allegations that the NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared.
Thomas Oppermann, a parliamentary member who leads a parliamentary panel that oversees the intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without exposing himself to danger and that the relations with the United States would be completely destroyed", it should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a parliamentary member for the German Party of the Greens, posted on his Twitter post a photo he is with Mr. Snowden.
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his trip to Russia.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to the former contractual lawyer of the NSA, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he once left.
If Mr. Snowden witnessed in Germany, he would need a guarantee that he would be “safe” there, a parliamentary member said.
Mr Snowden in his letter said he was faced with a harsh and enduring campaign associated with persecution that forced him to leave home.
He said, however, that the world’s response to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across the globe and senior officials – including those in the United States – assessed the disclosure of an unjustified system of all-in-one surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
The killing regrets us, but we are innocent, the representatives of the Red Khmer defend themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan was the former head of state.
During the Red Khmer government, which was based on a mixture of maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population of the time, died due to exhaust, hunger, illness, torture and execution.
The commander of the S-21 prison was sentenced to life by the International Criminal Court for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, harassment and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the real scale of the murder was.
“It’s easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and thus interfere and repair the situation,” Khieu Samphan said before the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Red Khmer cadres "to treat people badly or kill them, to deny their food or commit a genocide."
He admitted “moral responsibility” for the dead.
“I want to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the people of Cambodia,” he said.
The 50-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Red Khmer regime, told AFP that he could not accept the apology of Nuon Chea.
He lies to us.”
He only wants to be released from guilt.”
“It doesn’t care for the other,” she said.
“If he didn’t give orders, his subordinates would not be killed,” she added, adding that the leaders of the Red Khmer are worse than monsters.
The Red Khmer regime’s “Ministry of Foreign Affairs” Ieng Sary, who died in March.
His wife Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012 the court found incapable of proceedings due to dementia.
Red Khmer leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 per hand luggage and $2 per coffee or soda, although they said in their Wednesday announcement that passengers will be able to keep the whole bag.
The new hand baggage fee applies to the baggage in the upper storage space, so small baggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers with the payment will wait until arrival to the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said that the hundred-dollar fee is intended to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to pay this fee,” she said.
The airlines began to pay the first and second baggage submitted in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and cp in the hand baggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Taxes are one of the ways to teach passengers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the meaning of this new fee is not actually getting more money.
It’s about the fact that the most loyal customers of Frontier have expressed themselves quite clearly that finding a place in the upper storage space is increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger on the front at the Frontier gate can bring a baggage for which he will not pay anything, while the other passenger on the front will pay $100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said the website and booking procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers know about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new handbag fee will not be in force before the summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
Passengers often complain about luggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling the luggage costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street perceive additional luggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to pick up enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of losses.
Most people did not pay for handbaggage fees.
Spirit Airlines was the first to pay for hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost company Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport counselor Jay Sorensen, who carefully follows the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage fee would bring $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Chairman of Midwest Airlines, recently flown with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met with Spirit's unusual fee for his hand luggage.
“To enter the aircraft was the most fluid I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I was waiting for the door to see the scratches of the teeth and the struggles.
The aircraft was full, he said, “and the deployment took place in a mouse.”
Frontier will also, according to the Spirit model, apply fees for coffee, tea, sodium and juice.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole bottle and coffee will be supplemented for free.
Water will continue to be provided for free.
In 2008, the US Airways briefly attempted to introduce drinks fees, but after passengers’ complaints, it withdrew seven months later and no other major airline imitated it.
The last step of Frontier to pay for hand luggage if the passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline is its last effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay to online travel vendors like Orbitz from $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to drive passengers to buy directly from them, instead of doing it through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone far in this area.
In September, it began to give customers who bought through the online travel agency only half a mile within the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for the floated miles to 25 percent miles from the road.
So the journey with Frontier 1000 miles long purchased through the internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business begins to crush and loses money.
According to financial results on Wednesday by the corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity dropped by 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of this airline, Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
NSA does not blame hackers for the fall of websites, but “internal error”
The Secret National Security Agency last Friday that its website for several hours last week fell because of an internal error, not because of an attack by hackers, as some claimed on the internet.
“NSA.gov sites were not available for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a DDoS attack (distributed service refusal) is not true.
Earlier this evening, the online server sensors noted that the NSA websites did not work for at least six hours, and the pages are still unavailable to some users.
An earlier NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were “no at all” threatened.
The spokesman said no secret information was threatened.
At least one group of hackers on the internet claimed that they were responsible for removing NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are loaded and the page falls down.
This cyber tactics is relatively simple and the sense of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super secret agency of the NSA, once named No such agency, has been the center of public attention in the past months after the uncover of foreign and domestic surveillance programmes and the target of craving criticism—in summary the product of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and their disclosure by the disappointed former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has triggered earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profits declined due to decrease in supplies and orders
The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced on Thursday a 15-percent decline in net profit due to fewer aircraft orders and supplies in the third quarter and contractual problems in the rail unit.
Bombardier with its headquarters in Montreal has also not published any air test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it provided up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will comply with the ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the start of the test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft only flew three times, so the question arose whether the test phase is progressing well.
The results did not meet the forecasts and the stock exchange in Toronto dropped by 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen lowered the rating from “high profitability” to “sector performance” on Thursday, with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience a limited growth during the next quarter or two.
“While we mostly expected smaller aircraft supplies, the profit gap in transport has disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a report to customers.
With the continuation of the test program, we believe that Bombardier will obtain new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that the market skepticism towards this program will rise.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will move into the lower market area that is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March, and after a few months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the test flight results to be able to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and savings on the cost of this transport aircraft.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 compulsory orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The leaders also told the analysts and the media on Thursday that the program is progressing as planned.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft stop.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and that we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to land in the coming weeks and the rest soon afterwards.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to launch the aircraft and will provide up-to-date information in the coming months.
“This slow rate of flight testing – although it is in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell to $147 million in the third quarter ending September 30, or $8 cents per share.
The refined revenue per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover marginally decreased from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’s IBES system, analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, it only supplied 45 aircraft during that quarter.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the air division amounted to 32.9 billion by 30 September, which does not change even by 31 December.
“The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but the low receipt of orders and the overall state of the market disappointed us,” said Beaudoin.
The revenue in the aviation industry fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said the revenue in this division grew almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion by 30 September, a marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit gap in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several major contracts.
The leaders said that new prospects will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette, dropped on Thursday afternoon by 8.5 percent to $4.83.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, announced a 10-percent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the mafia before police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) had to transfer the information to the king of the underworld to Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried that his drug addiction would be revealed.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The top advocate who informed the drug mafia about a large police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had to transmit sensitive information to the underworld leader Neil Scarbrough after becoming a suspect of using cocaine about his investigation into drug trafficking.
The lawyer, whose surname was “Bash” (party) and who was criminally celebrated as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after the police monitoring of Scarborough, who he was represented in previous drug-related proceedings.
Police saw Sarborougha (32), as he left in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just on dinner with his colleagues from the Lawyer Society, three bags of cocaine.
Based on tests in which traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his pockets and credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of class A drugs.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he sought to get information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were then traced as part of a large investigation of heroin and cocaine trafficking in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police arrested heroin and cocaine worth approximately £1.5 million along with £200,000 in cash, another 32 people were sent to prison along with them.
Ditta (42) transmitted the information to the criminals in fear of being addicted to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors company based in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty after a three-week trial in two cases of interference with justice.
During the previous hearing, he admitted to holding cocaine.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police investigation found that Scarborough was in a regular telephone contact with Ditt in February 2011.
Two detectives watched the suspect, recorded his arrival in Ditt's house and saw him placing 60 percent cleansing drugs under the lawyer's basket in a black golf gloves.
Afterwards, Scarborough and Ditt, who were on dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, were in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where the drug was found, and nine conversations took place between the two people.
The court said traces of A-Class drugs were found in his hair, wallets and credit cards and that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested but denied the use of cocaine, and said that he talked to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation falls into the “confidential communication.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get out several credit cards, but all were detained and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said he was operating the office at both his home address and at the workplace, and that customers visited him at home because of work matters.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he previously represented to tell them what the detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Anyone else is more aware that he should not violate the law than a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not only about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the norm of a lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation worked as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Ditta did not bring good reputation to his profession, rather he dishonored it.
With some of his clients he became too close, especially with Scarboroughem, and allowed his independence to be distorted.
Ditta rejected the crime and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I wanted to give information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead from Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal from a criminal at the time he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading organized crime groups, which gave him the task of collecting valuable information about police investigations.
Advocates must comply with the highest principles of integrity and encourage public confidence and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to hide behind the coat of his profession.
The Lancashire Unit for Heavy and Organized Crimes has conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine holding and now for defending justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring criminals to court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and put you before our trials.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was declared guilty of co-working for the purpose of suppliing heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta organized an online interview, in which he said that his dream work would be to legally represent customers from the death toll block in America, as a guest at dinner would wish Muhammad Ali and as a motivation for work he stated inequality.
He talked about the government with Klaus and Spidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won 14 members in the elections, that is, only one-third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of YES.
The government has at least one advantage to negotiate.
In the team, which has already begun to discuss the circumstances of the possible coalition, they have Jana Kasala - the man who made the terms of government participation in the years 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
Per this time it will remind the first negotiation in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
“The experience was minimal at that time,” Kasal estimates how this year’s talks will develop.
The Chinese press is bound by controversial media law
“It’s a scary news and it’s right to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply breaking down the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspapers said.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most recognized independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be predicted because it is the extended hand of the government” and that content and advertising restrictions will damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will hear us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the parliament,” he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill actually gives the government “full control over the media” and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have held a hard blow” and criticize the bill as “strict”.
The approval of the bill comes in the midst of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September Islamic shooter's attack at the Westgate shopping center.
The Kenian media turned the anger on themselves when it broadcasted a security camera record on which soldiers sent to the site of the attack allegedly robbed the shop of luxury goods.
The police director responded by allowing two journalists and the head of the media to be interrogated, but the call was later withdrawn after the press of the media.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be penalized by up to 20 million Kenya shilling and individual journalists by up to one million along with the risk of "outsourcing from the list" or can be rejected official journalist accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the criminal if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single penalty is enough to destroy most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenya “live blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if the media is silent, they can do what they want.
“You’re never knowing what can happen,” the journalist wrote to Nation Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenya’s media as the key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“When we leave it on the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
The lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the reductions ordered by the National Wage Agency and for the restoration of their fat wages around 532 000 untaxed shilling monthly, which is thus ranked among the highest in the world.
It’s a good thing to do, the young Czechs know.
Most people don’t even know what interest.
More and more people are giving their money away.
However, they do not reach the champions in the region.
The average amount of money is paid by Austrians, who spend an average of €181 per month.
More than the people in Slovakia.
This is the result of a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the dealers is improving and two-thirds of the respondents plan to give themselves more money.
While the Czechs are approximately in the middle of the scale, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little savings products.
For example, almost every second Serbs, according to the survey, save at home "under a knees".
This year, the number of people who spend more money per month has increased.
Even last year, 26 percent of respondents spending a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns each month on various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly deposit in the inter-year comparison, however, slightly decreased to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among the savings products is the pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of the Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings only for 36 percent of the people.
On the contrary, the popularity of construction savings is decreasing, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has also declined significantly.
It is now used by only 16 percent of respondents, while last year it was a quarter of the people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them don’t know what revenue on individual products they.
Mostly young people under the age of 30 don’t know how their money is profitable.
On the contrary, the best consciousness about the profitability of their deposited money has the oldest group of respondents, among people over the age of fifty, 73 percent of respondents know it.
In the international comparison, the Erste Group leaders in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
The following are Slovaks and Austrians with a 12 percent gap.
United Nations Celebrates New Goals to Combat Poverty
The United Nations is starting to work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon said at the summit that it was time “to rise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to introduce the general Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress that has been achieved within the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development programme after 2015.
I will make every effort to fulfill the mandate granted to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that the MDG builds on success.
Security concerns in Mozambique are increasing due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputa to call peace slogans on a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
From fear of the future of her country, she exchanged business clothes for a shirt decorated with the inscription “we demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, daily reports came about conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo party, some of the worst confrontations since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebellion movement, initially supported by the White government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, he became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will explode again in the country, but the recent events have caught foreign investors and local people.
The rapidly growing economy is at stake, as the discoveries of large coastal oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest can in the next few years bring from companies such as the Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and the American Anadarko, investments worth more than $50 billion.
The ruling Frelimo, the dominant political power since 1975, and Renamo have blamed each other for the emerging tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has triggered recent conflicts by launching an attack on its members on September 17 in the province of Sofala, the traditional basement of the Renamo Party.
The violent attacks of former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and tried to kill Afonsa Dhlakamu, the group's leader, said to the Financial Times party spokesman Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government accuses Renamo of triggering conflicts because it said it had attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to mitigate the concerns of instability.
Mr. Guebuza told the French news agency AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a “destroccant” who wanted to use “everything he had left to try to prove that he can order his own decisions to the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns increased when the words of Mr. Mazanga were quoted that the Renamo party is leaving the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he thought that Frelimo did not respect the agreement anymore.
“Our goal is to go back to negotiations, but with seriousness,” Mr. Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have made for the relief of tensions between these parties, breathed by a number of struggles this year, just a little.
It’s a scratch between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
No one of them is a good negotiator and no one of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought election changes, has already stated that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort of the downward movement to gain from the government benefits and financial profits.
The Renamo party’s voting share has decreased since 1992, while the newest party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the election.
Mr. Mazanga says Mr. Guebuza – whose second term ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“The democratic system does not want more parties, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because it does not want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
The majority of the strikes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers away from the capital Maputo, but where the city is Beira, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to speak about whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappers.
“People think that the responsibility for the country’s future lies exclusively by the government and the president and that he should be the one who finds the solution to the problems,” he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
“No one is interested either in Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that “the gross strength cannot be equal to the intelligent lust,” while the Artušov legend reveals how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would “be too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene for school teaching,” said Crossley-Holland, who apologizes for a careful selection of works that correspond to the age.
“I think it’s great that myths and popular creation are already part of education,” he said.
I kept this plan for twenty years.
He added that “openly teaching” authors and teachers are at a fascinating story with a “sub-proof” message for children as a “output”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from English and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and British National Stories, says: “You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you leave them for yourself.”
Per the greatest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended with a happy end, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And that must be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly established.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
The Brunei Star Station will take visitors into space in a new digital
At first glance it is clear that the hall of the great planetary has changed over the past six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can get into new comfortable seats and over their heads a 17-metre-diameter project area in the shape of a cup from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are placed in the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
“It’s about twenty one computers that generate image,” said the director of the Brno Star Station, Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors is not covered, but gives a comprehensive impression.
“The performance of computers is thirty to thirty times higher than the performance of classical personal computers,” the technician Tomáš Hladík said.
The digitarium can excuse an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The spectators thus accumulate directly in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Other similar facilities are closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the star hall plans to show the purchased shows and its own creation in the hall.
There are two programmes on Saturday.
The first is named Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of the astronauts, fly into the space, turn to the centrifuge, and then see on clear examples how challenging conditions astronauts in the space face.
The second show is for children and has the name The Wizard Cave - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a rock whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment the nearby volcano exploded.
The entire digitarium cost about 50 million kronor, which was paid mostly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the Starbucks have also contributed small amounts from its budget.
The project area cost 10 million kronor, the projector twelve million.
“The rest was absorbed by audiovisual technology and computers,” Dušek explained.
The installation of the digital was followed by the restructuring of the entire building, which the star building passed two years ago.
According to the Director of Duška, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We studied 11,000 inserts!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job ads, of which 4,300 were published in daily press and 6,800 ads (62 percent) on the internet.
Therefore, the Internet is becoming the most important medium for the publication of job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) it stood at approximately 60 percent.
The advertising of employment opportunities in itself, according to the analysis, significantly reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and during the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 25 900 ads were published in the same period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is focused on a closer, more qualified group of professions.
On the contrary, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a broader range of professions including those of the workers, said analyst Pavlína Šťastnová.
The degree of representation of the selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the main places were advertisements looking for managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The positions of programmers or small business managers were only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, the large representation belongs especially to the servicing and workers’ professions.
Of course, the most common demands that employers express through an advertising offer include education.
Other areas followed include knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the demand for foreign language knowledge was shown in three percent of advertisements, on the internet in 37 percent.
In only two percent of advertisements, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Requirements for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily press in 11 percent, on the internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the industry was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Requirements for practice are all linked to qualified professions.
These are mainly manufacturing leaders and other managers.
Workers' professions are mainly mechanics and repairs or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairs of electrical instruments, the author of the study added Jiří Tillner.
Employers also indicate in the middle of their ads the requirements for the characteristics and skills of the applicants.
As the most frequently desired skills, communication skills have long appeared in advertising in the first place.
Moreover, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that the city of New York is the place where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the varied artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell the gathered people jokes by the method of conversation.
Fay’s innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, celebrates its 10th anniversary this year – along with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to play in the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes the performances of Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, the annual musical comedy beneficial show at Madison Square Garden, which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival expanded, the world of comedy also expanded.
A number of comics attending this year’s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has risen up with his sitcom (the pleasant “League” on a fantastic-football theme at FXX) and now has his own comedy show at the Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both “Saturday night live” and “Parks and recreation”, but most famous for her rapidly spread video series “Marcel the shell with shoes on”.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, racial-oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest attractions of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show entitled “Sit down comedy with David Steinberg”.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and says to himself, “Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I will live here.”
Oil prices drop to $96 per barrel
Oil prices on Friday continued to fall as concerns about high stocks were balanced by a report that showed the strengthening of China’s energy hungry production sector.
The U.S. oil index for December supplies during late morning fell in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the decrease was 39 cents and for the month of October fell by 5.8 percent.
The wealth of oil stocks in the past few weeks has burdened the price.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. reserves increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production came an incentive to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
The Brent oil, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell at the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
So not, Mr. Hassle.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that not so.
It is necessary to develop such a pressure that Martin Hašek should be deprived of all political functions and leaving the parliamentary office.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so low.
Martin Hašek protects himself with the promise he has given, but everyone and politicians especially must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politicians have (Mr. Babiš has the material, but the question is whether they are politicians).
The best program promoted by a liar is unreliable.
In politics it is not forgiven, in politics it is dismissed.
Mr. Hasku, if you think well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in that, if you don’t lie – here you see how difficult it is with lying), you’ll leave politics yourself, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a weak, whose words and actions cannot be believed.
Whether you want to be a proud, a misleading person or a lifetime sketch.
It may seem unfair to you when I address only you, but you are the leaders and they are just the misleading sheep.
And you are the leader and you have always wanted to be.
I understand that now you are trying to slide your ears for a moment, to reassemble the forces, to settle the shame and then to attack again, but this is the way the partisans or the subjects behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave so.
Take responsibility and leave the policy.
The court blocked the order concerning the detention and search procedure by the police department in NY
The Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday blocked a court order requiring amendments to the person arrest and search program at the police department in New York and appealed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Federal Court of Appeal said the judgment of judge Shiry Scheindlin would be delayed until the decision on the appeal that the city submitted.
The judge in August ruled that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its stop and interrogation program.
The city of its conclusions and its amendments appealed, including the decision to assign supervision that would help the police department to change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested delay.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge must be withdrawn from the case because she has come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judges, by not acting as a judge according to the request to avoid appearance of subjectivity, partially due to a series of media interviews and public statement by which she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted the Black and Hispanic as part of their stop and search program.
It established an independent supervision to monitor major changes, including the reform of procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test the cameras carried on the body in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to terminate the method of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after police investigation.
The oral justification of the city's appeal is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of arresting and searching persons have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In a certain form there has been the stop and search of persons for about a number of decades, but recorded surveys under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, most of the cases were black and Spanish.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to a minority, filed a lawsuit which became a group lawsuit case.
Representatives of the changes to the stop and person search program carried out by the police department in NY claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the trustworthiness and efficiency of the police body and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
The opponents claim that the change will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve the wider problem when the police body is under pressure after its numbers have decreased by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of arresting and searching persons which is constitutional, but reformed the way the surveys of the police department in NY introduced.
A fifth of the shopping centers are facing low traffic.
This is according to real estate consulting companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Bohnics the shopping center of Krakow will be opened to the public and will be the 19th Prague shopping center.
There are now a total of 90 major shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Insufficient performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are insufficiently large center toward the location and poor layout, i.e. too much floor or complicated and unclear arrangements of passages, or dead places of centers," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle retail department chief Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the shopping centers are facing low traffic.
The main reasons include, among other things, poor traffic availability, low-income categories of local residents or the excess market in a given place.
Some projects opened almost entirely occupied, but their results were mainly insatisfactory at the beginning.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and don’t like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centers have to make more efforts to ‘track’ their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
The occupation of shopping centers is, according to Soták, generally stable, even in some centers it rises, because the tenants were willing in the crisis to discount from the rental and to rental some units.
"It is true that some projects have been opened recently, which are not fully occupied and thus decrease the average occupation (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
The shopping centers opened over the past two years are promoting the market very slowly, according to Sylvie Samadi.
There is a marketplace for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is a space for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called 'convinience centers', focused on purchases and daily services for the population living in the immediate surroundings," Samadi said.
Also, according to Soták, there is a place for other shopping centers on the domestic market.
And that’s both for small ‘service’ centers, and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have space for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, they see space for the prepared shopping center on the Victory Square, and they also have a clear potential for the Na Příkopě and Václavské náměstí.
“Intenzively develops the expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expand into smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, respectively their reconstruction such as the reconstruction of the Prior shopping houses, which benefit from the good location,” said Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of over 2.2 million square meters of gross rental area.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of renters, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the average of the EU, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is behind about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson broke into the phone to check the tip
Former editor of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods of “inbounding in the phone, watching and confronting” to confirm the fraudulent tip on the love relationship to be involved by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey court said that the News of the World newspaper captured in May 2005 fake news that Clarke was seen with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspapers commissioned the private investigator Glen Mulcaire to get into Pawlby's voice box and penetrate her privacy, but the court said Coulson was calling her and leaving her voice messages.
“The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who stands in front of the house and hopes to catch people out, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they say about it,” Mr. Edis said.
He said that the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: getting into the phone, watching, and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Evidently he knows about the other, watching, he must know about it.
What about the first?
Do you know how to get into the phone?
He says no, we say, “but sure he knows.”
The rumors about the love relationship in which Clarke is involved were captured for the first time by the NotW newspaper reporting department, when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was said: “You’re just losing time, that’s with Charles.”
The recording with voice messages taken from her phone at at least three occasions, was obtained in Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator’s computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “Projects”.
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous telephone calls in which they were asked for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were monitoring Mrs. Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005 in which he told her, “I got a story that we are going to give tomorrow and I would like to talk about with Charles.”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as with other important figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
In the court on Thursday, it was that Coulson faced Mr. Blunkett for a love relationship with a married woman, while he himself met with the co-accused Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with other persons for the purpose of getting into the phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck, and Weatherup have admitted to the phone.
NSA disclosure increases social paranoia of state surveillance
One peaceful day, in late August, a German police helicopter crashed over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the U.S. advanced patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claims that the BfV authority hoped it would be able to identify the presence of hearing antennas, and this action launched in Berlin an exchange of opinions between the U.S. and German Foreign Minister.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in the benefit of U.S. companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who from his collaborator became an informator, began to uncover his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they have to trust the words of the director.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to the data available to U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, a general paranoia about state tracking of new dimensions has reached.
The last drop came with the disclosure that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel was ten years from listening.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then the potential target are the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden revealed the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used to mutual benefit.
“Germany has to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, chairman of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by the consulting service of the EY, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial spying and data theft, the U.S. now poses the same risk as China.
However, in the entire documentation revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is so far no evidence that the United States had transmitted trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
The politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities, and said it should try to limit its dependence on the United States:
The leaders are skeptical about this.
The German parliament says we should make a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn’t let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to car and farmers.
Everything except the industry.
The scope and technical advancement of the U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is still shocking for some companies who so far believed that China was the biggest threat from tracking.
There is a huge shift in cloud computing, where European officials have become more aware that data stored in the U.S. falls under the jurisdiction there, and therefore are potentially controversial.
According to a survey conducted by the business community Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-American members, after the US Prism data mining program was revealed, canceled their plans to use a cloud provider based in the US.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s chief executive, says: “We have a new question for customers that wasn’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is carried out is not a surprise.
It always happened.
“This has been a key topic for many years and has not changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our.
Business leaders generally do not want to proud of the countermeasures they have taken so that they do not give the attacker the advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been remembered that taking a free USB memory disk to the exhibition or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s Board of Directors, says it has been a common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the Board of Directors, so that they can’t be used as a hearing device.
The German BfV authority advises managers to consider whether not to use simple prepaid mobile phones on travel abroad due to the risk that smart phones may be fraudulent.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be dismissed.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leading leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in its report.
The U.S. warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, American documents National Intelligence Estimate in February France alongside Russia and Israel in the second row of criminals engaging in hacking activities for economic reporters, right behind China.
A member of the Council of the German Risk-free Society concluded that in terms of economic spy, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “The services know quite well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a young boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a crumbled fighting spirit in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 falling down in a cornered spirit behind the tribunes in the gym school where he went.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died unfortunate accident, but the family of the 17-year-old boy refuses.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer who represents Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this is contrary to logic, physical laws and also to healthy reason,” Crump said.
They believe that this is to shut down what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
“As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in the pocket of the dead,” he said.
Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a regular investigation of Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said in a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I think there is a sufficient basis for a regular investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the original pitva suggested that Johnson died as a result of a “position distraction.”
But according to Moore, the second pitva indicated another cause of death.
“There are a few questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if in the case of Johnson's death he reveals sufficient evidence for an order to investigate a crime or a civil rights violation, he will request the FBI and its execution.
The representative of the sheriff office of the Lowndes district was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the tracking cameras that the investigators watched.
The teenage’s parents hope that the videos will contain a trace leading to revealing how their son died.
CDC has issued a directive on children’s allergies for schools
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in case of children's food allergies in school.
This is the first set of such directives that the U.S. government has issued, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC Center found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools about how teachers and staff are aware of child food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline – the most commonly used automatic EpiPen injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening over-sensitivity.
State lawmakers have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that appear in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, “It’s as if someone was swallowing in my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I’m swallowing my tongue.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “non-sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize third gender in children born with unclear genital system.
Newborn children will no longer be classified only to either male or female gender.
The new law does not require the parents to specify any gender for such children, and allows them to specify gender as “non-specified” or “unspecified” on their births.
The objective of the law is to stop pressing parents to make their child’s decision to operate for the purpose of determining gender, and to fight against discrimination of those who are intersexual.
One intersex person said after many years, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain a saladine created by the doctor, swallowed and wounded.
It is estimated that every year one of 2,000 children is born, which is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, covering the term for those with atypical chromosomes, genital glands (ovarians or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersexual could be Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to determine gender, it is better to use the best available information and determine them instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is carried out, if not at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender determination problems, said that the new German law “looking like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery and then you can wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of how the child develops sexuality is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It’s like a mystery why some people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Committee, intersex people were described as different from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not linked to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively neither male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as none of them.
These characteristics may manifest in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys that don’t match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to indicate in official documents male, female or “third-sex”.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian woman, became the first recognized “genderless” person in the world in June when she won a court appeal to maintain the status of “uncertain” gender to the end of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Internal Affairs, German passports will have, in addition to M (man) and F (woman), also a third, X, mark for intersex persons.
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, the gender issue is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition for the removal of “gender theory” from school books.
The American Catholic online website also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is driven to a new state where gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn twice the other two pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see that the children are attributed to gender at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful even without any further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female gender were called hermafrodites, according to a beautiful Greek who had double gender.
And about ten years back, the medical community believed that gender is something like a table that can be deleted and repainted.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes make a wrong decision because they don’t know how their gender will feel when they grow up.
“In the middle of the 20th century it was called psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The continuing theory of how to treat children with unclear gender was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the opinion that gender is subjective.
He created a new concept of “gender” and argued that social causes and environmental influences – how parents raised their child – affected the child’s genes and hormones and formed the child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theory became controversial.
The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to a poorly performed circumcision, he recommended that their child be completely castrated, removed his testicles and raised him as a girl.
“Media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he left himself operated back on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38 he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” until today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the internet, the survivors of these operations appeared “unpleasant with the result”.
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but unclear sexual system.
Doctors were uncertain whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he would never be able to live a “satisfactory life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed outer organs and testicles and was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“I knew I was not a girl,” she told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 he was sent to the vagina plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrible.
After I was born I was sterilized and no one told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender developmental disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genital system.
After he learned the truth, he turned back to a man, took the doses of testosterone and let him remove his chest,
The operation caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and strives to normalize perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the director of the California-based Advocates for informed choice group, is concerned that the German law “calles to cheer and stigmatism.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will accomplish that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose ‘unclean’ for the child,” she said.
We are afraid that this will encourage intervention.
We think it is better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don’t know how the law will eventually sound out, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid gender,” she said.
The German law is scheduled to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child should not be deceived at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would “power” both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called an androgen intolerance syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie's female characteristics have developed.
It has a vagin, but has no uterus and ovaries.
Currently, 29-year-old Katie is married and works as a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania for her studies.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or substitute maternity.
“The law gives parents a certain space so that they don’t rush with their decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to perform certain tests and reflect on it and gives them time before they write “man” or “woman”.
In this regard, everything is okay – you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy with it.
You don’t have to rush with an operation that is irreversible.
“It gives the opportunity to engage the child in decision making and removes the anxiety that the parents bind because they are not sure they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child decides with which gender he is more identified – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
A drunk man threatened to burn the house with gas, he threatened to burn it with his family.
The tension increased, the fear increased.
He threatened to burn the whole house.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as the Mladé Boleslav firefighters unit and the Volunteer Firefighters unit, came to the site.
A police officer also arrived at the scene, who tried to justify the man’s irrational behavior.
The man threatened to burn the house.
In the house had to enter an intervention unit, which destroyed the man and connected him.
The aggressor then ended for examination at the Mladoboleslav Hospital, where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol arrest station.
The firefighters eventually filled the house filled with gasoline with a sorbent, which they later cleaned.
All animals were rescued in addition to people.
The man did not give the police negotiator, so the command went for him.
Report: Obama's campaign was considering to exchange Bidena for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times, secretly considered to replace the 2012 vice-president Joe Biden candidate with Hillary Clinton.
This disclosure is the most significant sensation of the unattended campaign 2012 book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine got a copy of the coming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president's top collaborators had organized intense group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to estimate whether the release of Biden would help revive Obama's blinking hope for re-election.
According to the national-political reporter for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of the lead officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former White House office chief Bill Daley, to measure what effect on the election would have to move former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of vice president.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and within the Oval Workshop.
Only a few presidential closest advisors – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House chief advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The "Double Down" book claims that Daley was the representative of the attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to do this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would "not significantly increase Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I’ve studied a lot of things and this was one of them,” he told Daley.
You should not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we asked ourselves, “Christepane, what should we do?”
While Daley characterized the research as “necessary care,” Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the re-election campaign spent little investments to find out if this move in the election is worthwhile.
“In campaigns, such money is not spent on elections and quality research unless something is really seriously considered,” Martin said at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then boss knew about this potential card mixing.
While Daley said he didn’t think that the president “was aware of the potential changes,” the former head of the office admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question whether the political sonda got up to Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn’t know about the research related to the removal of Biden from the candidate.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur made the first ice cream to shine in the dark – using medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a lighting pamls.
The idea came when he read the expert discussions on medusa, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes lighting.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the pH levels in the protein and consequently causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream shines when it responds to the heat of your mouths, and therefore, the more you lie, the brighter it is.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicious,” says, “It’s a wonderful substance, but when it comes to production, we’re at the start, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this substance.”
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heat the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream begins to shine.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea for celebrating Halloween because it causes this fantastic bright effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because medusa lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
That’s why it costs about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its untraditional flavour of beer, cheese, cow and gold leaves.
The next product is even more ambitious.
He says, “I really would like to make an invisible ice cream.”
In its essence, this is impossible because of the brink of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I count on finding some way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the medusa, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was a child, Halloween was magical.
With my sister we could eat sweets, stay up for a long time, and show up to our neighbors in a dress.
Today I feel like I’ve become a puppy.
For two years there was no sweets in my apartment and this year it probably won’t be different.
However, statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I am a black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), the majority of Americans will celebrate Halloween this year – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations.
Every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
NRF estimates that $1.2 billion of $6.9 billion is spent on costumes.
This year are the last shot of fashion sexy non-live objects.
Sexy can no longer be only women; sexy can also be foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for men, I expect that thanks to the pass of the dead we will see a lot of zombies, and I bet that the Daft Punk space men will reach it this year to our Instagram channels.
According to Google, the most sought out costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there is nothing wrong with going according to the tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
So you will see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
This is about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, leaflets, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets, and Clark stripes.
This is a wonderful news for 41 million cowboys who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are going to attack our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and believe not, and consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn sweets, and yet, according to the National Association of Sweets around Halloween, they will sell almost 16 thousand tons.
This is about 9 billion individual corn sweets.
This is a secret that I have never revealed.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than terrible houses.
They have the best names, such as “Terror behind the walls,” “Howl-O-Scream,” and “The House of Shock.”
In fact, there are in the United States officially dedicated 1,200 scary houses, which, according to the American scary houses, have a profit of $500 million, and this includes those amazing photos you are scared of fear and that your friend will put on Facebook, and you can’t remove them and the person you like will look at the photo and write a comment as “Beautiful face”.
And finally a little bit about the dwarfs.
When we were small, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big puppy (Great Pumpkin) and cutting a puppy lucerna is something like decorating a Christmas tree – we do it from small.
Fortunately, for us, the trend “Child in the Dinner” started thanks to the Pinterest app just last year, so most of us grew up on the fact that we cut the bar instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People's Census Office, Americans will spend about $106 million on the dune.
The dwarf lighthouse with a moisturizing flame on your front veranda is likely from Illinois, where this year it has grown 245,000 tons of dwarf.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut their thumb weighing one tonne.
The Land Rover Race Series
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety bands as well as intercommunications equipment.
For choice are improved brakes, service package providing access to the Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between the individual races.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “Race participants coming to Bowler have changed.”
Not everyone is experienced runners, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also a achievable path to world-class races.
We are glad that we can offer them this journey in collaboration with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in the UK and abroad, and that it will prepare the competitor for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge we really – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and test day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
TOP 09 Chairman Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting a new early election.
A week after the last in an interview with Aktually.cz said that there is no other output and that every government coming out of the voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible chicken.
“It can’t last a long time,” said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying the life of the starting election period is estimated to be up to two years.
With the opposition that the voters will hardly choose completely differently the next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a slightly more balanced decision."
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections as this year (as compared to 2010 it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it would be clear in two months that premature elections will be held, it will strengthen the 2011 ANO movement of Andrey Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, the grandmother will lose.
The turbulent situation in the CSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka after a secret Lania meeting of part of the party’s leadership declared that he or Michal Hašek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, Schwarzenberg says:
“The leading officials of the Democratic Party like little boys go behind the head of the state to allow them a coup in the party.”
“I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and smarter.”
“Because I haven’t seen anything so unexpectedly foolish done in my life,” added the chairman of TOP 09.
And toward President Zeman (with whom he met in the struggle for the presidency) he tweeted: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to empower that party."
The top 9 has been introduced.
What was the biggest surprise of the election?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House of Representatives, including the Faric Register of Contracts, which was discussed by parliamentary committees before the elections, but with early elections fell under the table.
The chairman of TOP 09 in an interview with Aktually.cz says that such a speed is given by the fact that "these laws are needed."
At the same time, the TOP 09 clearly wants to advance similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of the fact that the idea of introducing the register of contracts "stolen" the ANO movement program.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the advance – it has simply wiped out the proposal, which had been passed into the second parliamentary reading.
Firefighters arrived to rescue lost puppy that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous hole in a stone.
Ruby's cousin escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, a man found him imprisoned in a stone that married a dog.
The firefighters sailed around the rocky wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The dog was released by firefighters who came to release him after in some way himself was imprisoned on a dangerous hole in a stone of 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month cowboy Ruby fled after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days until he was released from a stone accident on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit Stone Hall in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, feverily searched for their lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, around 14:15, a dwarf-looking dogman saw Ruby on a roof in a stone, 15 meters above the ground.
The technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station was rushing to the place and sailing down to release Ruby, using a carrier bag for animals to take him off the rock.
Specialist commander of the technical rescue team, Andy Clayton, said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rocky wall – 15 meters from the top and down.
At the rescue he didn’t move the bridge – he was completely frozen.
Now it is okay.
He got cakes.
It was an unusual exit.
The fact that someone has seen the dog is incredible.
Expert commander of the technical rescue team Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, and in addition to exhaust and dehydration he was okay.
Mrs. Hall from Halifax in West Yorkshire said, “When I looked at the rescue, I was afraid.”
First of all, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It was great to keep him in the arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We are very grateful to them, they were all great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: “We feared he could fall, but he stayed there.”
The firefighters were great.
We still don’t understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that Katy Perry has not gone.
During an Australian radio interview this pop star said this week that she sang accompanying vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went out after her.
She added, “It’s been a long time ago and now he’s very kind to me.”
In a statement on Thursday, Jagger’s (70) representative said that he categorically denies that Katy Perry would ever make proposals.
He said, “Maybe you’re mistaken with someone else.”
Perry was one of the guest singers (songwriters) who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted this week on the first place.
George Kerevan: Separated Europe gives Scots a choice
Next day, another terrible story of independence.
This time, there is a warning that the condition for the independence of Scotland to join the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This brought the cause to the stories of pass controls in Berwick and the sharp wire along the Hadrian valley.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this did not come into the newspapers’ titles.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adjusting their official laws if they agree.
Since Scotland is now not in Schengen, the offer of continued dissatisfaction would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for anything they really want from Scotland.
This is a weak story.
I heard a journalist cat that “independence means passport check,” at least 40 years ago.
However, there is one interesting idea hidden in this bright story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to listen to Europe?
Why change the London chomout for the Brussels chomout, especially now?
This is the true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally broke down.
The result of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
Thro Europe, the influence is gained by parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came as if everywhere and already in the September federal elections took up almost five million votes, thus essentially "outsourcing" the Free Democrats (equivalent to British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
At home there was always resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The savings dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the swirling kazayka onto the national economies through the attachment to the common currency, have brought many people to the view that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that the national governments are managing a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
It’s rather a system of the euro that blocks its members on the exchange rates that are favorable to German exporters – and that’s what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, Southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut the revenue and public expenditure – what Germany encourages to do.
Behind the current problems with the budget and the currency is the deeper cause of European low performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – the code to support French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for petrol than it is in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the cost area, as we have seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even all the freezing of wages in the world would not disrupt the European petrochemical industry with the U.S. oil.
The result is a smoking rebellion, especially in France, once enthusiastic of EU supporters.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that will keep Germany on the forefront and allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy, and it has prosecuted its own economic policy in Europe and left the used French economy to its fate.
The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, just won major additional elections and drove the ruling socialists to the third place.
The Front is now with 24% of the votes the most popular party in France – a timely warning for British Labourists that they cannot judge that the division of the right will automatically manifest positively on the left.
How does Le Pen behave with her newly acquired popularity among the White working class?
The next year’s European elections would be used to create an anti-European block across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If anti-European parties lead well in these elections, which is likely, such a block may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
I think that in the near future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will unite and the euro will disappear.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something more free in the sense of “Europe of (suverene) nations,” which was preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Britain to get away from this project and to join the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a region (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests—this includes the opportunity to notify Berlin and Brussels when they are to let us be.
I assume that Scotland would lead well in the liberalized arrangement of Europe, provided that itins its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries would be easier in the non-Federal Europe of peoples.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The government of the SNP in Scotland is – strangely – the most successful political movement that does not advance savings in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition’s attitude towards the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if now Scotland voted for independence only to adopt the savings measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early adult
Research has shown that African-American and Spanish women reach puberty earlier than their white companions.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching.
It is not proven that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it.
Experts say that one of the triggers of early puberty can be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so visible in boys.
Former CNN Reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared when her daughters begin to grow their breasts and hair loss to shame at 7 or 8 years old?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference this week in Orland, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I’ve spent a lot of time making sure my parents that it’s usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as growth in the breasts, hairstyles on the shame and in the palms and body odor, appear in girls earlier.
However, in the past four decades there has been only a small shift in the age when the first menstruation occurs.
The average age in the United States is now 12.5 years, compared to the age of 12.75 years in 1970.
“When the breasts begin to develop, it will take at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem” (Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem).
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual beginning of puberty, but if the growth of the chest is accompanied by a growth spurt before the 8th year of age, the girl is considered “pre-adult.”
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which children’s doctors can carefully monitor.
Faster growth can be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are therapeutic procedures that delay the early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to a stop of growth and curvature in adulthood.
Recommendations on medications and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
As for the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but it acknowledges that “pressing puberty can relieve problems with the girl’s behavior and her feelings that she’s different from her companions.”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruations.
“They are worried that they may get pregnant or how they will manage hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” a woman remembers whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school, scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are guilty.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most serious cause is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped with conducting a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which connects body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Spanish women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything possible from economic conditions through climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although hair loss in the face and shame appears in boys at a young age, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the Conference of the American Association of Pediatrists (AAP) added more complexity to this topic.
Acne and hair loss are common even in infants and babies.
“We need to be careful when it comes to how we identify the actual beginning of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrist on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean the need to talk to the child earlier than you would expect,” said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need the assurance that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Konvalink in the role of the household.
Has a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the scratch in the role of the house and it was very good for her.
That would the favorite Czech actress plan a change of profession and go to business in the bar?
Nadia Konvalink appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and played a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I was able to do it.
Even the boss offered me to hire me and I could feed me by turning beer.
But I refused, I’d rather stay at what I’m doing until today, at acting,” Konvalink, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the Irish bar’s operation, said with a smile.
“I love Irish beer and I’m going to get Irish whiskey there,” she said.
At the event appeared a long-year-old friend and colleague Pavel Nový.
I am after the death and I am not allowed to clay in the present new life.
I have one beer or one cup per day, and I try to observe it,” the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers demand the width of seats, big orders are on the stake
Between the leading aircraft manufacturers, a dispute about the second-class seat width for long-distance flights has burned up, leading this month to a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-distance flights for the economic class – not exactly the one that would normally be preceded by airlines, but whose assigned space is the key to the efficiency claims for the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called for industrial standards this week to offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main U.S. rival Boeing says that airlines should decide about it.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of their two-motor remote aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the back of the aircraft is distributed – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis for economic performance requirements for the designs of new “mini-jumbo” aircraft.
Boeing says the enhanced model “777X” will carry 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm distributed by 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats divided by 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other in technical matters through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to gain superiority with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he previously showed what could be the beginning of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture showing three people stuck in a restaurant with the title "Do you like it?"
“Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seats thinner than in regional turbophone aircraft,” said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people are bigger, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern remote air transport, by the end of the century, according to the U.S. Department of Health, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has 100 cm in a passport.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the seat concept of the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests that the seat extension by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus seats sizes and says it is not in the authority of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about providing airlines with flexibility and enabling them to do things they believe they need to do to be successful,” said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, a greater space for locks is essential, but for suppliers, it is a growing problem that can affect the revenue.
Behind this dispute, the trade in aircraft orders with an estimated trade of at least $700 billion in catalogue prices in the coming decades is enough to shake the tongue of weights of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, the seat distribution is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to 20 percent better efficiency in their latest designs of two-motor remote aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10 seats concept.
“The reason why Boeing does this is to push more seats, and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a thicker layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“The 45 cm wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, cabin interior expert, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don’t deliver seats, but they offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Travelling aircraft sellers even carry a measuring belt to check the competitive arrangement.
While honosing with comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density arrangement for low-cost companies and regional passengers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin adjustments by offering wider seats in the streets for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single further major modern aircraft manufacturer, the call to new industrial standards will remain unheard, but it can disrupt the 777X sales wave.
The number of HIV infected in Prague has exceeded a thousand.
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121 and in 2010 it was 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and this was a record number.
“There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200,” said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who has been leading the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, from January to September last year there were 165 HIV patients in the country, this year in the same period there were 176.
From the start to the end of this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
The number in September reached 1005.
A total of 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was heard by 156 people from the South Moravia region, 130 from Moravskoslezsky and 116 from Usteck.
The lowest number of people infected was 19 people.
In total, 88 percent of patients were infected by sex.
Thirteen people have been infected by blood transfusion in the past.
However, such a case has not occurred in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, that is, over a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with the HIV virus, which was transmitted to them from their mother.
The fools in the movie Gravity are, but watching is beautiful, experts say
The fantastic film from the universe Gravitation some time after the premiere sold out in the Czech cinema.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by 150 thousand viewers in October and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the picture positively.
However, there are some irregularities in it.
The server Lidovky.com asked experts from astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any absurdities that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetarium Brno): I love science-fiction movies that I consider modern, dream fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not exclude, even though it looks like a "physically real" show.
No, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad.
I him very much.
You can see the hair of Sandry Bullock, which is not in a state of weightlessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station are moving on significantly different orbit routes, so they can't be seen in one picture.
Some viewers of the film condemn the unrealistic effect and the whole fire behavior in a state of impotence.
They also said they would not be able to suffer such wounds.
Heroes in the film Gravity often get into collisions with different objects and clothes without greater difficulties everything will last.
Criticism has not been saved.
So extensive tragedy on the Earth's orbit is, according to some discussors, unrealistic.
Furthermore, he wondered why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People are also discussing on the forums about the “nereal” behavior of the lens.
It seems like it was designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetarium of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide plate so far, but I can clearly say, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but a science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (fast obligation) not to consistently follow reality.
“More than the irregularities you mentioned, I was touched by the three-fold display of a space station with degrading level of technology (the last Chinese).”
"The Chinese will be until the end of the decade and will probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors very successfully try not to violate the laws of physics, and so naturally-oriented viewers will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions the moment of movement is quite correctly preserved, said in the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic including the thin slopes of the atmosphere and the polar light blinking on the polar areas.
The irregularities will surely be found with a more detailed investigation.
Additionally, for example, when I read the comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various spacecraft on the orbit appears in some scenes reversed than it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employer of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and heavenly sin against logic or natural laws I did not record in the film and compared to other films of similar focus is to see that the creators gave rise to the credibility of the events shown.
From the moments that don’t make sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that Hubble’s space telescope rotates a differently inclined orbit than the ISS.
The result is a significantly different speed and therefore the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the time of the division of Kowalsky (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I didn’t notice that the entire ISS would rotate, so there is no clear origin of the force operating on Kowalsky, which forces both actors to leave in the moment they don’t move against each other.
New Nicotine Vaccine Can Remove Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can remove the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before testing on humans, it is necessary to perform additional tests, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says that the first signs are good.
“We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available today on the market but found that their nicotine addiction is so strong to overcome all the current approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was compiled to carry genetic information for the formation of anti-inikotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies pursue all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the smoker from receiving a nicotine intervention.
In the tests of the vaccinated mice, which was added to nicotine, they continued their usual activity.
But the mice that were not vaccinated, “calmed,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine came into their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be administered so often to maintain an adequate level of antibodies, so they proved expensive and inappropriate.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower because they transform liver cells into factory for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could be given to children before they will have a cigarette taste to try, and thus would prevent nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, it would be used by smokers to stop.
“They will know that when they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine they won’t have any pleasure of it, and that will help them get rid of this bad habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they warn that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies that he would be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Surveillance Committee.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal rental policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three real estate on a government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its investigation to whether Mr. Obeid was lobbying with several state ministers to restore his rental at Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and a cafe, without having to participate in the tender after his expiry in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid’s secret interests in these properties, on the basis of evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi’s former representative, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of negotiations started in 2005, the government pushed for the rental to go to public competitions.
The locators were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual conditions.
In 2009, loans for in Circular Quay, which brought Obeid $2.5 million a year, were renewed without having to participate in a public competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of public competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, insisted on a shift in government rental policy.
The transcription of the calls submitted in the ICAC showed the calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodim and Steve Dunn, the chief official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the department for fishing.
“Is the development of the commercial rental policy the subject of the conversations during these telephone calls?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can’t remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked a Syrian target, official said
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikya on Thursday night, a responsible official confirmed by Fox News.
This responsible agent did not specifically say what the goal was, but said that there was at least one.
The news agency Associated Press that the target were the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an air strike on missile supplies in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it’s different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke so that he could agree with it, while the chairman Štěch was discouraging.
Heitman Chovanec was suspicious to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and confirmed it.
The President of Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of that misery of the CSSD and continues.
The others mostly showed their weaknesses.
The Senator Dienstbier is fundamental and readable and unusable, the Vice-President Zaorálek made the most impossible by a television conversation.
Based on this, I don’t see a better option than that the CSSD proposes to the Deputy Prime Minister of the Senate Gajdůškovou, the only one would not have the initial handicap and I think it would carry out the standard performance.
This is so good that hardly anyone from the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done, and continue without breaking the side.
Alena Gajdůšková could form a minority government without fear with a merely blessing from the President Babiš and without the people, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorkou, who is actually a faithful social-democrat.
This minimis government would have a great stability, because it would promote the ordinary referendum law and it was committed to supporting the President of Usvitu Okamura.
President Babiš would eventually agree with the progress of taxes, because he is wise and will see that it cannot be done without it.
People would not bring trouble, because Hovorka is the carrier of the best they have, and they would not be in the government otherwise.
The same goes for yes, also here a valuable minister would be found, but when reasonably they do not want to enter the risky government participation, but they will provide support, too well.
Let us give the courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Foreign workers with a visa license may be subject to the ‘licency test’
With the fact that the government plans to expand the police interventions, it is considering the “legality” test for foreign workers with a visa license 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fulfill unqualified jobs, or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour deputy Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers by saying it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The loud statements of ‘strangers at the end of the front’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remainder of the time when the unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said to the Australian-India Institute.
Historically, this meant that the White labour force should be protected – and I’t wonder if anyone in this region has recorded the sound of this historic artefacte.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he talks with officials for human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remains to be considered.
If the “approval” criteria are adopted, the visa applicants may be examined in detail whether “the nomination is eligible in situations where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsoring enterprise.”
After previous experiences with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lanka man who sought asylum has died of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship to the Christmas Islands this week.
The man's nine-year-old scared son traveled to Australia with him and after his father's death on Wednesday he was comforted by an adult cousin, who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities have taken him to a hospital on the Christmas Islands, where he died.
The British government has announced a study that aims to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and North England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
The transport minister, Baronka Kramer, said the project would "connect Britain together."
The Scottish transport minister, Keith Brown, said he was “unpleasant” with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, the line will lead from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to find out further rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is truly a national network that will better connect Britain and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
Thro the UK, HS2 will make 18 cities more connected, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “unclearly” support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed trail has the potential to bring to Scotland immense economic benefits, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore enthusiastic to cooperate with the British government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bringing benefit to everyone and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers during the next year and to make a joint decision on further steps.
A police officer and an analyst arrested.
Information about the arrest of Vita Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the report was brought by the server Primnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found that the case was taken by the General Inspection of the Security Corps (GIBS), and her people had to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It was at the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection addresses cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its authority also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, among the detainees is one of the anti-corruption police officers - the chief analyst and computer scientist Jan Petržílek.
He has previously worked for the Security Information Service.
A spokesman for the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, refused to comment on the information with a note that the media must address GIBS in this matter.
Her spokeswoman, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything about the case, but referred to the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of secret facts," the spokeswoman of the parliament, Štěpánka Zenklová, said.
Also from this unconcrete reaction, it can be derived that the event took place, but it is in a secret mode that does not allow speakers to say anything concrete.
In the same situation, the lawyer of Bárt's Oldřich is poor.
He told the media that Barta is represented "even in this case", but given that it is a secret information, he cannot confirm or deny Barta's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart’s arrest could be linked to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted by Barta together with former VV Chairman Radek John, who was head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that burned between former Prime Minister Peter Nečas and VV had even to be resolved by then President Václav Klaus.
I don’t know where this connection has come to me.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
“I really don’t know anything about it,” Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became the police chief.
Officially he was promoted by Radek John, the real party leader but was Barta at the time.
Barta has now been a candidate for the Movement Dawn, the parliamentary mandate has escaped him just tightly - with 175 votes.
Tomio Okamura said he didn’t know what it was about.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not or is not a member of the Light of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," Barta Okamura distanted himself, who said before the elections that he gave Bart the space to candidate for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executives.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former counterparty from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
The rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft will remain in force in Australia
Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during the start and landing even regardless of changes in the U.S. in order to alleviate the regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their practices, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during the critical phases of the flight if the devices remain in the “flight” mode.
Passengers can already do this during the majority of the flight, but many people are troubled that they can’t have access to their electronic books during the start and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but they have suggested that they do not plan to change their procedures soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it has examined this notice, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft,” he said.
This question is covered by the regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety isined all the time and that passengers act in accordance with the safety guidelines they obtain from crew members.
Virgin, which has already talked to CASA about extending the use of its onboard entertainment wi-fi system, was inclined to the change, but announced that it will be subject to the regulatory authority's decision.
“We would welcome the CASA to conduct an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices because we really think that it would improve the customer experience now that we have a wireless board entertainment,” the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will continue to comply with current regulations.
“Our current policy is that electronic equipment should not be used during landing and landing, and we do not intend to change it in the near future,” he said.
The FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory field that can be useful for our passengers, and we are sure to thoroughly study the FAA decisions and the reasons behind it.
In the case of air carriers from the U.S., the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their airport.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, and also review guidelines, training materials, handbag programs and information for passengers.
“When the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones, at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment should be saferly stored under the seats or in the storage space above the head during the departure and descent.
With the increasing poverty of the middle class, Singapore’s stands are experiencing flourishing.
In a stand-up in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops the golden armband, ring and ears in order to be able to pay the school fees to her daughter.
“We and my husband just bought a house and I gave all my money to it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator she receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across regions in Southeast Asia – where the household debt is increasing – is indeed that ValueMax, where a woman is doing her transaction, has become the third stop on the ranking this week at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Stopping jewellery is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsure bank loans.
Singapore stores normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, the stops have the advantage that they do not require a person verification (payment history) or income certificate, and they can provide a loan faster than the banks.
And therefore, as families feel pressure because of increasing living costs and increasing household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turn to stops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to stops to cope with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted the increasing use of household loans primarily due to the increasing lease as a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is on the top of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week just so got out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continuing weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The important thing is that with the rising costs, people from the middle to the low will try to complement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people captively stop their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewellery for cash.
Approximately 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 urban stations are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop the grandmother's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest station operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has a 20% increase in the number of customers using its station in recent months.
The growth in the steering industry is so large that ValueMax, a branch operator in the center of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branch – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund it using 60 percent of the 66 million SGDs it acquired on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount borrows have found themselves under the fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the deposit offers not only lower rates than other borrows, but it also does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers stop the items that they already own, and the funding of personal property does not increase the household’s debt,” he says.
In the company, the asset deposit is increasingly accepted as a means to ensure short-term, secure financing.
Among those who use the stops, in addition, are not only people in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branches when they stop the gold stripes or Rolex clocks, and can thus get up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are from all possible proportions.
“These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans because of their brave or investments, or small who need help solve problems in their cash flow,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
$325 million rescue package for Tasman healthcare
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's falling healthcare contains harsh conditions that will ensure that the state government does not miss funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek said the Australian Union is taking "accelerated measures" to counter the crisis caused by the island's aging population, increased number of chronic diseases and system disorders.
Financing for four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasman parliament Andrew Wilk.
“The government has come with an emergency rescue package that, as we believe, will solve the specific problems the state faces,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for operations on the patient's request.
Further 2,600 operations including ortopedic operations and grey stroke operations will help remove debt.
The money is also available for free-to-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better postoperative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the ideas that the leading clinical doctors told me that they will help the Tasman health system in the best way,” Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasman government must require a rigorous system of reporting and registration obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of financing to receive the money from the Australian Union, and inform monthly where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member committee shall be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will be useless "unless a real reform is followed to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasman public health system."
However, he praised the government for his response to his urgent aid request, which he first raised during talks with the Prime Minister in early May.
“I believe that the federal aid package can release public health from a critical state,” Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is just a “plast”.
“The reason I’m here is that the Labour government has removed $430 million from our healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a state government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union that devotes $300 million, and pretend it’s a good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no one dollar from the rescue package will be issued to higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the novel of Denis Diderote, which brings an exceptional film excursion and characterization of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It takes place in the 1960s in France in the 18th century and tells the dark story of Suzanne, a noble young woman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When she is rebelled, she experiences an extremely cruel treatment from the punishment-destroyed mother presented, and for the other she becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film never slows down to sensuality or sensuality and that’s his problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that even the viewers will experience a face similar to wearing a ginseng shirt.
Skiareals want to relieve families with children
Syria has destroyed its resources for chemical weapons, the supervisory authority says
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, said the Global Surveillance Committee on Chemical Weapons on Thursday, while sharp conflicts have exploded in the north of the country, near one of the places where poisonous substances are predicted to be deposited.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Civil War almost three years ago.
The Notice of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before 1 November,
The term established by this organisation with its headquarters in the Hague is to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing equipment for the purpose of producing toxic gas and munition.
The completion of this in principle initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons including yperite and nerve gas sarine.
The announcement came at the time that the struggles in Safira, which experts say is the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and storage facilities, were shocked on Thursday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, said.
A group of activists, which via a network of activists in Syria monitored the total number of victims, on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
There are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
There are 29954 members of Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18 678 government fighters and 187 Hezbollah militants in Lebanon.
Among the dead are also 2,202 government refugees and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s troops have fought in Safir against the rebels, many of whom are connected to Al Qaeda, for weeks.
The observatory on Thursday said the losses were on both sides but had no specific numbers.
The struggles have highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have to deal with close deadlines for their mission to get rid of the chemical arsenal in the middle of the continuing Civil War in Syria.
In a statement from the OPCW, which is closely working with the United Nations, it was said that its team is now “happy that it has verified – and watched the destruction – of the declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling in Syria.”
He added that “no further control activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that these two places were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons program that it contained were moved to two other declared places that were checked.”
It was not immediately clear whether the Safir facility was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has approved a plan to destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
“I worship the courage and courage you have shown to fulfill this most challenging mission that this organization has ever had,” observers’ director Ahmet Uzumcu said in a commentary by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, it stands against each other in the Civil War primarily Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government with its security forces, which are filled with members of the Alawite sect, the footsteps of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Ramí Abdul Rahman, said that a strong explosion occurred inside an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikya on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
The judgment of the founder of the bombing attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted discreetly to the sentence sentenced over the last of the founders who were raised before justice, saying that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent 10 years fleeing as one of the most sought after persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for composing the explosive equipment used in the bomb attack.
In 15 years he could be released.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of a mass murder in the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty in several other points of charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombing attacks on Indonesian churches on Christmas Night in 2000.
The accusation demanded lifetime, although it could insist on a man called “Demolition man” to be sentenced to death due to his reputation as an explosive manufacturer.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who in the destructive attack launched by Patek and other founders almost ten years ago lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny.
With tears in her eyes she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Mrs. Corteen said: “It should be built in front of the execution gang.”
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don’t see any other grandchildren and daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 a.m., a strong load placed outside the parking lot was exploded.
Peter Hughes was in the Paddy bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide attacker exploded a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion he fell to a moon in a coma, and while he wasined alive, three times the doctors “dead”.
Mr. Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jamah Islamiah responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This man should be sentenced to death like no one else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive is simply not.
20 years after 202 people were killed and hundreds more wounded, it’s not so much.
Patek was the last of the bombers in Bali.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but was eventually captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later the U.S. forces killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, the FBI agent in his testimony stated that reports of intelligence services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish connections between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He did not give up voluntarily,” Mrs. Corteen said.
Until now, he has not felt regret for how much sadness he has caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“We’ll see a lot of tears this year,” Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek can appeal against the judgment.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological achievements in aircraft (but do not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from door to door” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the unattended new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers don’t expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to each airline, FAA manager Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA administration how their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training guidelines for the crew and the storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already delivered the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“According to the state of such a plan, we can improve the extended use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft’s doors are closed.
They can’t enable them until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain has issued permission.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft falls to land and do not turn off until the aircraft is on land.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their equipment during departure, landing and departure, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adjusted so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, Chairman of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“When the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
It’s very tired that we look like “suchers.”
However, surfing on the internet, sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will continue to be banned below 3 kilometers above sea height, the agency said.
Passengers will be informed to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, a scrabble online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as well known, thrown out of the American Airlines aircraft because he refused to turn off his device when the aircraft was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops will have to continue to be stored because of the fears that they could hurt someone if they would fly over the cabin.
Mobile phone calls on board will continue to be banned.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the American Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may repeal the ban on certain electronic devices during landing and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the State Committee for Traffic Safety, a National Traffic Safety expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from the FCC data we also know that they can cause interference with broadcasting towers in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Branch Advisory Committee created by the FAA Administration to investigate this problem last month proposed that the government allow the wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been developed on FAAs to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to pursue, as the use of such devices is everywhere.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the interruption of navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry with them FM radio, the technical output of the time.
New airlines are much more linked to electrical systems than previous generations aircraft, but they are also built and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel heights.
Modified plans for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
A large majority of airlines should adapt to increased use of electronic equipment within the framework of the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasts than previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue a minimum broadcast when they turn a page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those who press to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company charged the transport aircraft with their Kindle electronic reader and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these facilities represent any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Passenger Airlines said he is convinced that the disruption from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only fragmentary reports from the pilots to support the fact that such equipment may cause disturbances in air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow the pilots to order passengers to turn off the equipment during flight on low-visibility devices.
The tourism industry group welcomed these changes and said it was a reasonable approach for the passengers, who use the technology in abundance.
“We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to safety,” said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was carried off the North Sea and released back into nature.
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back to the wild.
He was transferred to Aberdeen last month by a helicopter after he was previously treated by the Scottish company SPCA in a rescue center until he was healed.
The operating center Colin Seddon said: “This chest probably migrated from northern Europe when it was captured by a strong wind over the North Sea.”
He found a shelter and found a shelter on the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to fly again, so they contacted us for help.”
At the time he was released, he was in good condition and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign (Business for Britain) was launched in April with a promise to unite and define what changes in the relationship with the EU want to see British entrepreneurs and jobs-creating companies.
For this purpose, we submitted the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs about their views about the UK, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British companies of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We found that the vast majority of are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than engaging in a long and stressful process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their opinions on specific political areas—from monopoly regulations to product laws—the majority of entrepreneurs expressed their opinion that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now prevail the benefits of being part of the European trade area – approval was expressed by even 40 percent of large enterprises, which traditionally are the most pro-European companies.
And ultimately, our survey of business leaders revealed the most explicit knowledge, that a clear majority wants Britain to pursue a change in the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings that identified companies of different sizes and major business groups show that the business sector is pushing for a “sensitive change” that will bring the influence back to Britain.
There is a lot in bet – achieving a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can result in a profit of up to 16% when voting in a referendum for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports its plan to amend the conditions of the UK’s membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects that this amendment will mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back to the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible and as the eurozone is on its way behind a closer economic and fiscal union, it is even more and more necessary.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, and as the results of our survey show, for business it means re-focus on trade and a substantial change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry admitted that spying went too far.
The U.S. has sometimes been “too far” in spying, the U.S. head of diplomacy John Kerry told AFP during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the Ministry, the information was used to prevent terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington" according to AFP sounded in the middle of a sharp polemic on both coasts of the Atlantic due to the scandal discovery of the mass tracking of data by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the target of which were also U.S. allies.
“In some cases, I admit, as President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended the current practice.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of attacks such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
“We prevented aircraft from falling, buildings exploding, and people were killed because we were able to be informed in time about the charges,” Kerry said.
However, he again acknowledged that the collection of information "in some cases has gone disproportionately far."
The incident around the U.S. intelligence, which allegedly watched hundreds of millions of telephone calls, in Europe broke out this month.
Among other things, it was revealed that the Americans also watched the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their anger, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would deny or significantly limit surveillance.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria begins a new gas era
The launch of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“Today we are witnessing the measure: the construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream tube should add diversity to the routes of Russian export through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are “for ever” eliminated.
As soon as the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discount price.
Gazprom says construction in other countries in the direction of flow will begin by the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of soldiers to Syria.
There is a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous area of Kalamun.
According to increasingly accurate reports, Israeli airstrikes on two locations in western Syria on Wednesday destroyed missiles intended for Hezbollah.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Her program is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said it will prevent the transfer of weapons to the hands of Hezbollah to Lebanon.
The reports of Wednesday Israeli attacks on arms warehouses in western Syria are just clarified.
Israel has not commented on the attack, but it has been confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles launched from the Mediterranean region have hit the Syrian Snoubar Jabla missile base south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya reports that two warehouses in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon were affected.
According to the sources, it was a missile of the Russian manufacturing SA-8.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Jišaj said Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the Hezbollah armed section to deal with missiles.
The SA-8 is an outdated missile that the Syrian army has since the 1980s.
They are placed on a moving car.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, it is easy to hide them.
They are equipped with a radar, which will turn off after the missile is shot, so it’s hard to target them.
Latakya is located in western Syria, in a region inhabited by the ruling al-Qaeda.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the struggles in western Syria in the past.
He claims that he is helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the al-Arabians belong.
Now 15,000 of his fighters are allegedly ready to help conquer the army back to Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops.
Kalamun is located between Damascus and Homs, the third largest city in the country.
The battle is intended to be a revenge for the recent attack of the opposition on the command of the Syrian Shiite Brigade Abu Fadh al-Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah has helped the Syrian army to rebuild the city of Kusajr near the Lebanon border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusajr went just to Kalamun.
Even recently it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
As the reasons were mentioned corruption, the throwing of money for excessive purchases and public procurement, tax increases and not least government scandals.
According to the results of the election, it is possible to conclude that the majority of citizens suited this state.
That they did not really bother and with the state that was here (theft and debt of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise I can’t explain that 3,413 497 voters did not come to the election, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS in total thus 4,394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52,16% of all legitimate voters.
That is a majority.
When I add 1,016 829 voters to the above parties of the CSSD, then with the old order (because all of the parties involved in the "rooting" and debt of this state), then 64,23% of legitimate voters actually agreed to this state.
In fact, the majority of voters showed that they are not for punishing the guilty theft and debt of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the CSD who participated in this will rely on the appropriate laws?
Does it help us at all?

The Royal Commission learned that before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) were charged.
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned that before the charges against the child educator Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with child sexual abuse.
But before the Commission it was noted that in its initial statement to the Commission this association stated that they have never addressed the case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was interrogated on the case where one of the YMCA staff was accused of child pornography crimes, and on the other when a Caringbah athlete from YMCA was sentenced in 1991 for sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr Hare told Gaili Furness, the counselor of the Commission that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the initiative statement of the YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA, which appreciated the organization as a leading advocate of children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission says that the YMCA was notified that in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society in August of this year it received the second lowest of four possible ratings.
Mr Hare, who began working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him itself downward failed when Mr. Lord accepted, without making sure the staff was aware of the obligation to report violations of the safety rules for children.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys, which he committed during two years of working in the YMCA association.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Mr. Lord’s child safety breaches.
Staff members presented evidence that they witnessed such violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, guarded them in private, left them sitting with him on the knees, told them he loved them, and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for children's safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, proved that Jacqui Barnat, the head of children's services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's supervisor, was "very intimidating and it was often difficult to talk to him about something."
The Director-General said he did not receive evidence from the staff that they felt unknown if they had to contact their superiors and report the facts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord darkened their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said that he told the board of the YMCA in New South Wales his opinion that the lesson from the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization consists in the fact that the staff “not submitted any report” and the board agreed to it.
Mr Hare said that the decision to let staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the accusation appeared, was made by YMCA’s General Manager for Children’s Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that the goal was to avoid the distortion of evidence, but it was “excessively enthusiastic” and wrongly done.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, a child sexual abuse expert at Griffith University, told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not the organization that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, inspection, employment, training and staff management.
The hearing was delayed to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
In a night interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned after ten years in the leadership position, Mr. Blair mostly avoided talks about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a Ambassador to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, the London newspaper Evening Standard found his answer as follows: “Yes, of course, but it’s hard to happen that, so...”
While a crowd of horses show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he’s not yet going to school and just a few months ago he made the first steps, this boy and his pet, the Shetland ponny Toffee, smoothly crossed three rounds to eventually win the main prize and leave behind 30 wandering adult rivals.
This inseparable couple – with the same height – was praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank riding center in the village of Rudra near Cardiff.
He stood against the lords and ladies in elegant hates, knocked his baret into a joyful corner and allowed his two-year-old Toffee to walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control the horse, which far exceeds his age.
And Toffee gained the highest scores for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given to his third birthday in March, and since then he has been exercising with this Shetland ponic daily.
His mother Donna (30) said, “Fenton and Toffee work together greatly.”
They did not make a lot of hope, but they eventually left with a golden cup and a flower.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him a phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone encouraged and praised.”
He ran on the sand throughout the arena and although he acted so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has taken over two chickens.
Since it started, it will be back soon at the Horse of the Year competition and I am sure it will go well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show contest said: “Fenton has only three, but he already knows how to control a ponny.”
They make a great team together.
The judges picked out Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they showed themselves in the competition round.
They are always watching how good the teamwork is between the ponic and the one who leads it – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I'm sure that Fenton's beautiful clothes helped, he really suited with him.
Too curious newspapers are to be investigated
The Chinese newspapers, which on the head page requested the release of a reporter accused of fraud, will be thoroughly investigated, the manager told the press.
The New Express newspaper with its headquarters in Guangzhou made a rare public request for the release of Chen Yongzhou journalist.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took fraud to invent stories about a company partially owned by the state.
The manager said the New Express newspaper will now carry out “full correction.”
The regulation to “reform” came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in the province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about the said company Zoomlion.
“The New Express newspaper’s editorial management was unregulated,” the manager said in a statement.
He said he had to decide “to keep Chen Yongzhou an administrative punishment in the form of the cancellation of the journalist’s license.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to make a total correction of the New Express newspaper, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible in the New Express and immediately change the leadership of the New Express newspaper.”
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles on financial irregularities in the construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspapers issued on the head page two requests for his release and claimed he stood behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false stories for a remuneration.
“In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence,” he said to the state intelligence station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was looking for money and glory.
I realize I did wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued an excuse on the head page, in which he said he failed when he failed to do sufficient control of his reports.
Recently, a number of suspects were strictly watched on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly imposed, regardless of this year’s law amendment that prohibits the authorities to force anyone to accuse themselves.
A drug trafficking tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway has been found.
It managed to discover one of the most innovative drug trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico, supplemented with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities have described a tunnel of about once a meter as one of the most intelligent secret corridors they’ve ever discovered.
The tunnel, which climbs to a length of almost six football fields, connects a warehouse near Tiuanah in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of uncertain warehouses, where you can easily hide trucks before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed.
Together with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also, according to court records, detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men who worked as drivers were accused of possessing marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In case of conviction, the imprisonment will be sentenced from 10 years to life.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, the traffickers are penetrating into extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridory discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which faces drug cartels putting a problem in how to get their product to consumers as soon as possible.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridory of about 650 meters long, equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the center connect management.
For example, a joint advertising
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague’s Karlín.
Economia has made a further step in transforming the Center holding into its media house.
From Friday, Economia and Center have a joint top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are crucial for the integration of both publishers into a common media house," said Vice-President of the Economy Board and Chief Executive Officer Kamil Čermák.
Chermáka, who will be the head of the single management, will be supplemented by Central Holdings Executive Director Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the trade was named Pavel Vopařil, which is also undertaken by the advertising director of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová.
The new head of information technology has become Stepan Burda.
The joint director of the editions is Vladimír Piskáček, in whose team is also the transformation director Jakub Unger.
Adela Pitts was the newly established Director of Marketing.
The separate corporate communication department is newly managed by Věra Lhotská.
Joint Financial Director is Karel Žalud, Managing Human Resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
“The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a joint offer of advertising products, to better connect the creation of the content of all published titles and, not least, to further significantly efficient the company’s business management,” Chermák added.
Economia, which is owned by Zdeněk Bakala, has signed a contract for the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The Portfolio Center Holdings consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and the SMB agency Najisto or the portfolio of more than two dozen smaller websites.
The Economia Company is the publisher of the Economic Newspapers, the IHNED.cz news server, the Weekly Respect and Economist and the number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it is long-term the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This year in June, the publishing company moved to the newly built modern spaces in Prague's Karlina.
CME focuses on television business.
Almost a quarter of the people are released.
The media group CME will be dismissed.
It wants to lose a thousand people by the end of the year.
Osekat intends all side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs approximately 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of the people will leave their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
A part of CME is the company CET 21, which holds a license for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs approximately 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic television unit TV Nova, is not clear yet.
"It's premature and we can't really comment on it," said Novy Communications Director Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, the significant dismissal of the Czech Republic will not be avoided, but the greatest impact it should have on the staff status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new headers of Novy Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after long-standing director Adrian Sarbu, during a conference conversation with analysts on Wednesday talked about they wanted to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the costs of production of its own shows, filming and production activities.
A cooling tower burned in Prague in the night.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, a large-capacity tank burned, according to firefighters apparently a cooling tower.
"The firefighters went out on Thursday before 11 a.m. in the evening, this morning the fire was still heated," Prague firefighters spokeswoman Pavlina Adamcova said.
The amount of harmful substances in the air in the surrounding area, according to measurements, did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and causes of the fire are unknown.
Approximately 50 firefighters arrived at the Colben Street.
“It’s a large-capacity tank fire, probably a cooling tower,” Adamc said.
“There is no functional hydrant network in the area, we thus fire using the transport pipeline from the tanks,” she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the hardening was complicated by a poorly functioning hydrant network, so firefighters had to transport the water from another place.
The fire officer has announced a second stage of fire alarm.
The scores are four, and in the most serious situations the fourth is declared.
Chemicals also went to the site to check the levels of dangerous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
“They did not target the amount of harmful substances that would exceed the hygiene standards in the air,” the firefighters said.
British police announced extradition to Assange
The British police today delivered a statement of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found a shelter at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he requested asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that he had delivered a 40 year old Australian 'reference notification' with asking him to arrive at the police station and that if he did not do so, he could be threatened to be arrested.
In the UK law, Assange exhausted his possibilities when the Supreme Court canceled his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden for allegations of sexual crimes.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he sought asylum on June 19 at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he requested asylum to the South American country.
“Scotland Yard has delivered an announcement of extradition to a 40-year-old man who is asking him to arrive at the police station on the day and hour that were intended for him,” the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the guarantee conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the notification.
Assange is afraid to be expelled from Sweden to the United States, where he may face accusations of spying because he posted 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was sentenced to a fine of £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his feet.
The driver was sentenced to a fine of £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his feet.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree, Essex, was seen on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, he found that he had a cup of drink between his legs.
At the police court in Colchester Howie, he admitted to the accusation of conducting inadvertently and negligently.
He received seven points on his account, resulting in a six-month prohibition of proceedings.
Howiem was also ordered to pay the costs of £90 and a fee for the accused £100.
The London bubble breaks due to foreign property owners tax
The Ministry of Finance has preliminaryly calculated the income tax of financial assets, but awaits the final decision of Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget presented a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings at a price of over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the property transfer fee in the housing fund in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached £708 million, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr. Cook said: “Given the increase in real estate transfers for high-value houses and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are poorly taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated tax system.”
He added that “this step could cause some foreign investors to refrain from buying London’s real estate, or the existing owners refrain from selling it.”
The leading real estate – up 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in the center of London continue to show a year-to-year stable growth of 5.6%, but they were shadowed by the flourishing “home market” on which, according to a survey by the Savills real estate office, the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) experienced an increase.
Scientists have further explained how the axle movements are related to the mood of the dog
Earlier research has shown that happy dogs swallow their axis more to the right (from the dog’s view), while nervous dogs swallow their axis mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs are able to notice and react to these subtle differences in the axle movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have a different link to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions.”
We have seen the same in other species.
He added that, as with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for the left-wing movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an attempt to get more information about how dogs react to the unproportionate boiling of other dogs, the researchers monitored animals who watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably it will not take a long time to understand why their edge goes sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We’ve made movies about dogs to dogs – whether in a natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any disturbing stimuli, and we’ve also been able to adjust the axle movement and show it more right or left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise unreasonable dog moving by the edge to the right (from the sight of the dog wrapping by the edge), she remained completely calm.
But when she noticed the shooting of the edge mainly to the left (on again from the point of view of a dog wrapping with the edge), their heart rate increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would communicate consciously with each other through these movements.
Instead, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what movements they need and what they don’t need to pay attention to.
He said, “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their axis in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement to the right generates less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and practitioners better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a college veterinary teacher at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned their head to the left when they watched an aggressive dog, and to the right when they watched a joyful dog.
And in another expert interview from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “The dogs were more likely to get acquainted with a dog robot when they wrapped their axis to the left than to the right, when they were rather uncertain – exactly the opposite compared to the Italian study.”
The difference can be given by the fact that in these different studies dogs did not interpret animals in films or dog robots completely like dogs.
He explained that it could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“Al there are good evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified – and dogs are not an exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t take a long time to understand why their edge goes sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys suspended concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved a concert in Glasgow after the chief singer was diagnosed with throat inflammation.
Sheffield group was scheduled to perform on Friday in the city complex Hydro.
The disease of the singer Alexa Turner forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and on the basis of medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1.”
“Alexi Turner was diagnosed with throat inflammation and unfortunately he will not be able to go out.”
The show will take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20 and the show at the Hydro Complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these performances remain in force.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
The Vatican on Thursday announced that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals for the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals have the highest position in the priesthood of the Catholic Church right after the pope and are those who choose the pope, so Francis establishes his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the pope’s election – the group is reduced to 120 elect cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Pope Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the ceremonial awakening of new cardinals, an assembly of present cardinals, known as the Consistory, will be held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to call the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero, from the Catholic Voices newspaper, said the number of cardinals would likely decrease by February.
He said that the Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
Nowadays there is a certain orientation towards Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
40 percent of the Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to which he gave the task to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it’s “total possible” that these cardinals will be asked by the Pope for advice.
We haven’t been in this situation before – it’s a new thing.
Valero said the Pope traditionally raised to the post of cardinals bishops from major places, but Francis is “full of surprise – so we don’t know who he’s naming.”
GM takes down some new light trucks in the U.S. because of seat repairs
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors will withdraw 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to fix the defect with the manual folding of the roof.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism of climbing the front seats may have a defect.
As a result, the seats are not in accordance with the federal safety standards for the head seats.
A statement on the website of the State Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if the car gets a collision from the back, the head support may not properly protect the passengers, which increases the risk of a collision.”
The downloaded models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
GM launched its supply in June and for this leading U.S. car manufacturer it is the most important introduction of the vehicle from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the supplier of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notifications to owners due to a 16-day government failure, which in October weakened the growth of car sales.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were rebuilt for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models.
The shares of the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47.

When I finish patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches took your breath.
The elections ended with a tremendous overwhelming and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My colleagues were crying with joy and my parents were hiding the newspapers they got.
A young team of visionaries went to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During his office in 2008, Obama received 82 percent of the support.
I close the book here.
Going to the present is a hard awakening, like talking out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I introduced my first electoral card, there was actually a change.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the law on affordable care through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “not ask for anything, not say for anything” after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that party obstruction has turned so much effort to move our nation forward: among others, it is immigration reform, the public’s ability to choose health care, and the closure of a base in Guantanamo.
But after many situations where I defended Obama’s administration before colleagues and friends, I have reached the absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I was in a place of political disappointment.
The Republicans’ obstructions cannot explain their consent to the hearing of foreign leaders or the attacks of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children abroad.
It cannot be explained by them that the National Security Agency collects data about the privacy of Americans, nor that it persecutes those who reveal the wrong actions of the government.
They cannot be made responsible for the execution of Anwara al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without a regular trial or for the limitation of public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
They can’t justify the findings of the report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... from Nixon’s administration.”
And recently they cannot even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on available care simple website.
I don’t know if something like that could be expected.
I had to guess at the age of 18 that the government’s power could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it.
The chosen position obviously has no predictable course and our public talks will be formed by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above seem to be a result of the administration’s own decision.
And that worries me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unproof alternative, and it seemed that he could not strengthen his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes we once heard about.
Nevertheless, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support dropped below 45 percent this week – is increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the number of promises that have been lost.
This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a drastic defeat with Clinton during the primaries in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign he told his staff that he must get back to the pace and remain loyal to his mission.
“I want our magic back,” he said.
We should not forget who we are.
Five years have passed and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interests because of the parental leave program
Billionaire and deputy Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interests due to the program of parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Banni magnate, who is leading a dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax measurement, expressed this claim when he tried to get out of the table the question whether he was in conflict of interests.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect coal and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interests, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have a personal benefit from that policy.
“He was in a big conflict of interests with regard to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election commission officially declared Mr. Palmera the winner of the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast with the earning of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to accelerate the process.
Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the electoral rooms?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can come, touch the details into the computer, immediately vote and get the results at half the seventh?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of a pen to mark the voting cards.
Is it about the fact that the results can be gummed if someone doesn’t like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of a pen seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission examined the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political program also applies to the airport in the Sunshine Coast region and that he would take his new work “very seriously”.
Public service is a service to the public.
“We do not seek any reward except that we can serve society in this critical time,” he said.
Are you washing your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands will change your mood.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving an unresolved task.
Of course, both failed.
But the group, who washed their hands after failure, made a much more optimistic impression than the group where the participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" conducted better than the second in the next test.
However, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not wash them.
The "washed" results were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not notice any previous failure.
The results of the test indicate, according to psychologists, that body purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, and the testers need to concentrate much more in the next tests.
If we transmitted the results of the research to the Czechs, the most optimistic we would be after returning from the toilet.
After the use of the toilet, only one percent of the Czechs and the Czechs do not wash their hands, but after the road by urban transport it is already a fifth.
Hygiene is mostly applied after working in the garden or at the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The sex of a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of the Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after giving your hands to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of the Czechs and 40.3 percent of the Slovaks are washing their hands.
A study found that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"While it would be on the spot, I'm afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to make it a bit better," said dermatologist Klaudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons acquainted with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another clue that the global investigation by the control authorities on suspicious monetary market machinery is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes owners every day.
These two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation that will respond to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) scandal.
The bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our continuing investigation on this matter is ongoing and we are fully working with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event that RBS had transmitted to the British Financial Behavior Authority records of e-mails and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position as European Foreign Exchange Chairman at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi’s European Cash Trading Chairman, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former Barclays and UBS’s currency trading chief, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
No one of these traders was accused of any offence.
Mr. Usher’s group for the sending of quick messages belonged to banks from Barclays and Citigroup, people dedicated to the event said.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss control authority Finma announced that it has investigated suspicious foreign currency market machinery in several Swiss banks, it has taken steps against some of its employees.
Worldwide, at least six agencies – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Anti-Monopoly Office Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are investigating claims that these bankers have joined to move with the currency market.
People who were familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are scratching years old fast messages and e-mails to find cases of some offences.
The reports of the investigations threatened traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines to generate profits in investment banks closures in the past years, but which was disturbed by the small currency instability reduced opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-level traders say that this necessarily doesn’t have to be true.
A high-performance trader said that despite the significant amount of daily foreign currency trading, the liquidity gap between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week it released from its stock trading department a trader who caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader did himself and that this problem has been solved,” Credit Suisse said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague has exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have recorded more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the monitoring in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the State Health Institute.
According to the report, there have been 2,063 infected in the entire Czech Republic.
In 396 illness immunity failure has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased annually over the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later, they were already 121.
In 2009, the study revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010 180.
Last year the number dropped to 153, but last year it was record.
According to the laboratory, there were 212.
“There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200,” says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who has been leading the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011 tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the start to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
The AIDS disease spread in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected was in Prague.
Whoever really wants to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the Nazi center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the bedecr would reveal.
Many people read from the tombs.
Slowly, the cemetery turns and gets an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what faiths, how large and coherent families they belong, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their taste.
And from the state of the tombs they will also find out how the survivors take care of their dead.
Supreme Court Approves Obama’s Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the Constitution, which is a crucial victory for the Obama administration.
With a ratio of 5:4 the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Law on Patient Protection and Available Care – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they are threatened to pay a fine – does not contradict the Constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
Court chairman John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remaining parts of the law on 2700 pages and further ruled that the legal requirement of health care, which orders the states to expand the possibility of obtaining health insurance, otherwise threatens to lose all financing of health insurance from federal sources, is not compulsory and contrary to the constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Companies have filed a lawsuit to block this law.
During the 2012 primaries, the law strongly rejected each of the major Republican candidates, including the supposedly proposed candidate Mit Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a curved bear" no longer threatened prison, court cancelled the law
So far the Zimbabweans had to pay good attention to the public speech of the 90-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the beginning of the 1980s, and since the end of 1987, he has been in its leadership.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 to one year of imprisonment was threatened for disregarding the presidential office.
“The prosecutors should not fiercely blame people who comment on the president in bars or in other public places,” the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court's decision, the British BBC.
A number of Zimbabwean victims, including Tendai Danga, was arrested two years ago by the police for alleged insulting the president in a bar struggle with a police officer.
In May, an opposition activist who sparked Mugabe in the public with an abuse of a "bully eagle" ended in prison.
In August, the prosecutor then accused a twenty-six-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with the faces of Robert Mugabe as a toilet paper.
The court also declared it an unconstitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
“The state cannot punish people whose statements will later be false,” Justice Deputy Minister Luke Malala said.
To date, Zimbabwe’s law allowed a person who disclosed false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law allowing to criminalize someone for false statements has a frozen effect on the right to freedom of expression,” Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with hard hands for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil freedoms on a referendum in March.
A small step towards the dictatorship of one man in the country began in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought to the prime minister's seat Morgan Tsvangirai.
The country, however, continues to be affected by the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Nowadays, Zimbabwe is only paid in the currencies of other countries.
The economy is going on Mugabe’s unthinkable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, did not have any experience with farming.
Central banks will keep swap lines permanent
The provisional and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks said this in their joint statement.
“This is a very reasonable step,” said Julian Callow, the leading international economist of the London Barclays bank.
"Today, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not a surprise in my opinion," added Vojtěch Benda, the chief economist of BH Securities.
Central banks are strengthening the bond that began in 2007, when the international credit market for the first time dropped.
The agreements of central banks allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central banks comes in a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its program of support to the U.S. economy, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is standardly used to overcome the liquidity deficiency of one currency with the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of the other currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore trust in the European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on the Tipsport.com website.
But I did not finish here afterwards because there was just someone sitting on the branch who couldn’t complete the registration from the internet.
And because I didn’t want to ride to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved and thanks to this I changed the address and the number of my civil passport.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it can’t, because I have a different OP number, address and that it simply can’t complete and that I have to ask for data deletion and make a new registration.
So I did this and on 24 October 2013 I wrote on technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
For this a long day I wrote technical support that I have to complete the registration at the branch.
This started the e-mail marathon for technical support, where in the end after the 4th urgance 25.10. they wrote that personal data on my request was deleted.
Therefore, one would say that he could do that new registration and here started again problems first it wrote to me that my user name is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it's not a personal data, but ultimately they deleted this).
So I used another username and jumped on me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the subsidiary registration (how can they have stored something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
At my question how it is possible I was deleted that personal data was actually deleted 25.10. and I would send an email with that error.
I did this (this day around 15 p.m.) and on that today I was disclosed that I was registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that therefore it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I have been in contact with the technical support for a week and I’m talking to them that it’s not possible.
And what about the fact that if what he claims was true (as not) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the fictional e-mail and telephone number and the world wondered, the page appeared to me that the e-mail sent me a link to complete the registration.
How is it possible if you cannot register on the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport connects the registration to the e-mail and phone number and data simply does not remove as it claims.
So I once again told this technical support that they simply lie (either intentionally and or don’t know what they write), because what they write is not true.
I showed a few screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "fake" registration on this simply does not affect.
For this Tipsport wrote a strict sentence to me - Sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your claims.
He ended the communication.
Accordingly, it repeats the same sentence that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and so actually did not even go through.
So if I summarize, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as he claims, but still lies when he claims the opposite.
Worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it seem that the error is on the side of the customer.
By the way, after posting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little in motion and from Technical Support came an email that the matter is transferred to check and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and debate and warning of the same error).
Music is playing in the metro.
The Transport Enterprise hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music continuously plays during the metro operation, is the A line bridge on the exit to the Vaclav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček presents his new double album, band and three singers
Textair Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne City Society House not only his completely new double CD Czech Calendar, but primarily in the program Between us singers Lenku Novou, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matěje Benka.
After the introductory intru and the acting etude of the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how the last time they played in Cologne and the theater, and the electric current fell throughout the city.
“In other words, there were two types of cards produced in Cologne, with which I had a lot of contact,” he recalled.
The same was stated by the President of Zeman.
"Maybe we could make a tour of Zákolane or Dúbravce near Bratislava," he said about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who didn’t leave the stage and if he didn’t speak, sitting at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
The calendar was made by Josef Mánes, who gave him an orloj, about ice hockey but at that time he didn't know anything, how we meet on those squares and we scand, who doesn't go, is not Czech.
This is the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won’t play here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, from this album sang for him a very suitable Sleep in the day, sing after the nights and accompanied him on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn’t sing, he played perkuses, all three singers then accompanied by the band in the composition of keyboard, violoncello, guitar and contrabas.
The three vocalists together singed a bit of the craving to the side of the heart sitting, which immediately spread the viewpoint.
"I'm glad that you've been interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in the city of Kmoch," Michal Horáček replied.
After the remembrance of Peter Hapka sounded in the presentation of Francis Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Heger again reminded the song Dad loved Lida Baar and with Horáčkov's explanation about the communist ban and the replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West.
The composer of Michael Kocaba was recalled by the composition Sebastián, and Segrado then singed the wonderful composition of Prague, musiced by Jardou Svobodou, a pleasant native and former Kolíňák.
This was the conclusion, the compliment in standing and the addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
There was another playlist on the playlist, but the fans didn’t look at it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four seated behind the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his books and even the package from the legendary LP and with any interested people, she also photographed.
Born with Rosol and Hayek
At the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia nominated the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil to four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives are defending the trophy, but they go to play on the competitor's field to the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
“We know we’re going to the hot soil, it’s going to be wild and we have to focus on our performance as always.”
"We're going there with the only goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the winning point in the last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Obama has been trained to bomb Syria.
United States in Libya.
Top Gun in the Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hump, threats and millions of statements sent the aircraft, they hit the target and returned.
They would not be allowed to go off by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole act and do not express themselves.
Exactly the opposite of the confused and widespread acts of Obama’s unsupported Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying of all the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be confused by the media with their claims that the "Syrian base" or "supply for Hezbollah" has been bombed.
Recently I wrote here about the fact that while U.S. aid to the secular rebels in the country remains only on the retorical level, Russia is gladly continuing to supply weapons to Syria.
And just the fresh supply of Russian missiles deployed in the port of Latakia has become the target of the Israeli airstrike.
A clear message.
And note, Israel once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although according to popular internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government awarded two members of the space units, probably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they were honoured during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
It is known the heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA campus in the city, I think they were members of the CIA secret command, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculating what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even elsewhere located in the CIA residence.
Now it is clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by gun nests (just on one such both SEALs members died after a minomet attack) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two yet unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the Bengal attack, they voluntarily enrolled in the intervention and together with five private contractors they broke the way to the CIA campus in Bengal.
Obama’s administration is blamed by the fact that during that attack the command was not officially and entirely deployed and that he simply hesitated what to do.
The commander of the command, so without orders, will apparently release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that the country does not operate a single time, but permanently by the U.S. Command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently nothing of this has been officially recognized, and even now it is only talking about a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it’s good that the U.S. is trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
This would require much greater assistance to resolve the national situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It’s not so long since the media almost singed Iran’s air forces for pursuing U.S. drones.
However, it is little known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if it accidentally succeeds to discover its drone in the airspace, nothing can be done with it.
However, if the Iranian drone is discovered in the international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was pursuing a U.S. drone in the international space above sea, when there was the first sharp launch of the U.S. super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He went under Phantoma to optically check his weapons without Phantom registering him on the radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and called the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without hesitation.
It is not surprising that Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but that remembers the Vietnam War.
It cannot be compared to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It is a little paradox.
While his team did not succeed mostly in the last few years, the defense or defense of Victoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him after a year of return to the team.
He gets a shot, he gets an activity, after the intervention on him, a punishment shot was ordered in the match in the Teplices.
Victoria ran in the last two rounds against Slavii and in the Teplices after victory, but in the end of these two duels she took one point.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break an unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
“I believe we’ll be defeating the Apples at home,” František Rajtoral promises.
The team is carefully preparing for a heavy match with the Northern Czechs, who play offensive football.
Everything goes to the match with the Apples, the coach prepares us well, as always we get a lot from the video game team of the opponent.
"I believe that this will be a great match on Friday evening," the Czech representative attracts the fans at the tribunes of Doosan Arena.
The latter matches did not come as she wanted, but the word of crisis defense Victoria refuses.
So it goes in football, sometimes you have a good shape and sometimes worse.
I would not talk about the crisis in any way.
“I think we’ll win on Friday and it’s going to be good again,” the western defenders said.
Victoria's team will again rely on the support of fans.
“It’s going to be on Friday night and I’d like to invite our fans who are great.”
“I think we’ll be grateful for the victory,” Rajtoral added.
Pete Pete: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it so, it’s not actually a step at all, but a big jump – a jump a few years back, and that’s to the memories, to my childhood.
It’s a memory of what it was, not having any concerns and just coming out of school and washing the dishes, exciting and doing the tasks.
Although these "obligations", it was mostly just theory, the wishes of parents.
The practice was completely different - to run out of school, throw the bag into the corner and run out.
Play with the other children of the ball games, jumping a puppy.
Then in the series Helena and her boys shed a chain steam ceremonial wrap for grandmother to their birthday.
And only then after a few warnings to finally wash the dishes, exhaust, in the winter to put the wood into the stone stones and tasks to do until after the darkness under the lamp (or to rely on a fellow student and instead of tasks to write the loving verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, breakfast home berry marmelade (from real fruit, not such as the jams that are sold now, whose content next to berries didn’t lie) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that we and mom so gladly gathered.
I also remember those magical nights when there was the silence of the tomb in the room, when we and our sister recorded songs from the radio on the cassettes, which were loudly rotating in the old cassette after mom.
And then we pulled the cassettes on the pen and put together one and the same song, our favourite, and drinked a siphon.
Or we were calling through the table with the help of the sheets, which were bound to each other by a tape - and when we were already at that calling to better hear, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, then the ear was sirka + vata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now and my parents were able to live from it so that we didn’t miss anything.
We didn’t need any of the iPhones, iPads or even mobile phones and laptops or brand clothes.
Clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "pruise" to the closet was a baticated home-made t-shirt with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics we were satisfied with the mentioned mother-in-chicken and, at the maximum, the Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used in the same way only in the train on the school trip.
It came to us more interesting to play with your aunt Hop Hat or Man, don't be angry, or as I've already said to go "only" out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under the tree, sure the parents saved him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn’t heat us for a long time.
My younger sister narvala the straw into him, saying so beautifully papal the cassettes, so she tried if she spaped the straw.
Unfortunately, he fell, but it was his last quake.
Well, and this incident has to date, poor, on the plate from my father always.
She says that when Lenka was small, she narvala the strip into the video and thought she would play her a recipe and didn't play, so she can't cook it until today.
I remember how we were all able to communicate together, agree without a cell phone, a computer.
Together with my sister, we agreed with the neighbor's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother.
We met.
Promise to someone you’ll see in a year.
I also remember the winter when we and the whole village were running out, building snowboards, riding on a snowed hole near the church on bags drowned with dreams.
Then we dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we and our sister heard the notorious phrase before each dinner: "Be to wash your hands!"
Yes, that’s true today, but you don’t have a bathroom with a coat of soap in a lemon grid.
After dinner, when the father in the garage "worked" at the beer with Jardah from the village, we slept with the mother on the floor, wrapped the legs on the stone, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the breaking of the wood that lined from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we have on the social network, we knew how many friends we have, those real!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write each day messages through different chats, SMS.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
So I could continue for a long time.
It’s beautiful to remember, especially if I complement these memories by looking at the album, where the black and white pictures are tightly folded with black corns.
And if I didn’t know how much I was at that time, the back of the picture is always written the year of taking the picture.
I see that although our shorts according to the pot didn’t sound so much and in addition we had a brother’s pants two numbers bigger, no one laughed before, it was so normal (not IN).
I'm going to go back to that step - to the reality.
I'm going to wait until 2013 and I'm going to look forward to what the modern time will come up for my children.
What I know is that these my memories are now for the young teenage generation so at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they come a lot, that this "pre-monkeys" time they won't experience either.
I would wish them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei complain about Nortel’s patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of Nortel, on Thursday filed a lawsuit for breach of the patent against mobile phones manufacturers including Google, the company that it re-licited during the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, has charged Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for breach of the patent.
Rockstar is co-owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with breach of seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps connect the expressions searched on the internet with the relevant advertising, claims, which is the core of Google’s search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately to meet.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that operate on Google’s Android operating system, which is strongly competing with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial price offer of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent struggle, Google won Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partially motivated by Motorola’s patent group.
“In spite of the failure in trying to obtain at the auction patents that are the subject of the dispute, Google has violated the patents and continues to violate them,” the prosecution said.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation from Google because it says Google has committed a patent breach intentionally, according to the lawsuit.
Miloslava Cejpková: The November Smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not yet used to.
In the first place, she gave her a smile, the one she always gave to the end as a defense against the kindness of the friendly environment.
This made her a lot of relief because it was a mask she decided not to postpone on the public.
He was honest at home only in the days when grandmother and grandmother had grandchildren Elinka or Adika around him.
And, of course, when the sons called her.
He remembered very well the lesson from the infinite courses of business skills.
Finally they really fit.
Not to harass your closest.
Then he flew to the corner.
Like a dress on a mask.
November, neither another month can do that miracle to smile really, as when they were on a trip with the one who has been here for almost three years.
Egypt launches the first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi has made an inauguration oath, but his triumphal day will hardly end political disruptions in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he was celebrated as the first freely elected president of the country, after Husni Mubarak, who was dismissed 16 months earlier.
When he was placed in office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the collapse of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore before 18 judges dressed in black talks in a settlement built with a view of the Nile, which reminds of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today have put the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Murshi, a 60-year-old engineer graduated in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most 84 years since its establishment as an illegal organization was the target of sharp attacks by individual governments.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small column of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the court building to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential charm of the Mubarak period, the transport was just shortly stopped so that the column could pass the usual busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs in the south.
Murshi’s personal prestige, laughingly referred to as the non-arithmic “reserve tires” of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply from his victory and his Friday speech, which aims to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also to all those who want to bring to the end the rebellion against the autoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state today,” Murshi, dressed in a blue social dress with a red cravate, told judges in a wooden room, where he made a swear.
Murshi later went to the University of Cairo, where he had to present an inauguration speech.
While standing in vigilance, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national hymn.
The military commander of the field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the scandal “arms and people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became the basement of Islamic student movements.
Murshi made a symbolic swear on Friday on the Tahrir Square, where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian government last year was born, and solemnly promised to take over the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took over them from the dismissed leader.
But by agreeing to the form of an official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, as it is a habit, the will of the army was subdued, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghetts there will probably be police specialists, they have to relieve tensions
Police specialists should be involved in the Czech ghetts in the future.
They would spend half of their journey here.
They would monitor the order and solve problems.
Through their knowledge of the environment they should contribute to the reduction of tensions between people from poor places and the inhabitants from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs complies with this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would primarily help "accelerate social housing assurance".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were about 80,000 people, mostly Romans.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children finished in "special" schools.
Bujela lichva.
According to experts, the problem locations have increased by a hundred.
Relationships between the people and others are increasing.
An anti-Roman march was held in several places.
People from the surrounding area also joined the extremists.
According to the Interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with the ghettos.
The basic condition is “the consistent application of equal approach in law enforcement.”
This cannot be achieved without the detailed knowledge of the place and people.
The specialist would go to the guests in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In the problem area, he would monitor the order.
He would also know the local, so he could better solve problems or offences.
“Through the established confidence, specialists will be able to prevent a series of illegal acts more easily,” he said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive additional fees, from 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers in the problematic areas is to be paid from Norwegian funds.
The budget is approximately €600,000 (now approximately €15,5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
The preparations have begun this year and a detailed proposal is now being drawn up.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded locations is unparalleledly higher than in the Czech Republic.
“There are so-called Roma settlements here,” the authors of the report said.
The number of specialists there should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also matter how much money the police will be able to release on these members each year after the project is completed.
According to the draft project, the first selected police officers will take a stage in Slovakia.
Each year there will be 50 members of this training.
These are the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers who will operate in the ghettos.
According to the author, social housing would help improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea, the interior would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet accommodations with accurately defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards would have social apartments that would be comparable to ordinary housing.
Employers would have to comply with an integration plan that would be prepared by social workers with them.
They should comply with the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, re-qualificate and actively seek work.
If they were trying to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of housing.
The system of accessible housing should, according to the interior, work for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integration-motivated environment".
The model of social housing is prepared by resorts for local development and labour.
They have to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Carbon Mountains - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The Coal Mountains is a remarkable hill 3 km south-east of Bruntal.
Together with several others, the evidence of volcanic activity in the Lower Autumn in the time (geological) is recent.
The last eruption was at the beginning of the quarter.
With a view from a greater distance, on the top of the Coal Mountains is a visible white-melted Baroque Path Church of the Virgin Mary Assistant, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden chapel.
The hostel that stood next to the church was not kept.
Shortly after the church was completed, an alley of four lines of lip was planted, a length of about 1 km.
The Cross Road on the Coal Mount is already the third version, the original here stood after 1916, the second, from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
On the fifth stops are wooden plastics, which was made by the local art crater František Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the Low Autumn area.
Similarly, the substrate of the rocks from this area form an interesting geological exposure.
On each stop, the name of the sponsor is indicated.
The carbon mountain is the rest of a young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric age measurements are slightly different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is thus younger than the Great Roudny (age 3.3 million years) and older than the Venus volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
It has thrown a significant amount of volcanic ashes along with the pieces of rocks from the ground, which by burning gained a red-brown color.
At the end of this phase, the lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of a porous chedique up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw out red, brown and black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the broken wall.
In the tuffs, the visible volcanic pumps are large up to 1 meter. The second eruption was also completed by the lava.
At the end of the activity from the volcano fled a lava, which today forms up to 50 meters of a strong layer of a strawberry.
Volcanoes where the eruption of volcanic ashes and lava eruptions are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they got the name stratovulkány.
The original volcanic coil was gradually eroded.
However, he was threatened by the mining of rocks in a breakdown on the south.
The most intense mining was between 1953 and 1962.
Tufs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem, however, is in the pority and small coherence of the rocks, which quickly wind, break down and fall down on a curve.
The lame disappears quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-oriented hill is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Repair is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles areined in a number of important locations.
You will get to the Coal Mount by green tourist mark from Bruntal, or from Slezsky Kočov.
Car drivers can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the Lip Avenue, where a short learning path begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an acting villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas on Ořechovce.
The original owners of the house, however, obtained it back in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small discharge.
So, Ivan quickly sought a replacement housing for herself and her then older mother.
From acquaintances she received a tip for an apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
“In the beginning it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the extensive forest park and the hill on the other side inspired me,” Ivana reminds of the first impression.
I thought it would be a provision for three years.
"Today we live here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter moved from a twenty-five-meter apartment to a smaller with an area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be carried out, for example, the painting of the doors or the exchange of windows.
The previous owner broke out the core, but the owner was most disturbed by the unpractically solved and unnecessarily large front, and vice versa, a small bathroom.
With the combination of two rooms, a multifunctional living space was created.
The architects used for the definition of the individual zones and the division of the room a sandcarton, which allowed the new location of the lights.
The first intervention, to which she decided after a few years, was to remove the edge in the living room.
Thus, the apartment changed its disposal to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
The next step towards a partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for the laminate.
With the bathroom, Ivan didn’t know the advice.
I’ve been writing magazines for years and looking for inspiration.
In one of these, I recently discovered an interesting implementation.
I asked the young architect Kamil Douděrovou.
“It was actually the most important step in the future,” says Ivana.
Thanks to the restructuring of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the availability of the premises.
The architect connected the space of the toilet and the bathroom and replaced the two doors with the opening wings with one switch, saving space.
The bathroom is overtime and also quite barrierless.
High-quality clothes imitate a sandstone, in the shower there is a comfortable seat, a bidet shower at the cloth.
Successful cooperation with Kamil Doudera continued.
As part of the program How to build a dream, a quick but crucial transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
In the space, which was created by the unification of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, the dining, the living and the sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, for instance, the semi-cutting or the Japanese walls.
"This would result in a breach of the openness and unity of the space," the architect explains.
It originally separated the bedroom and living room.
It was enough to turn the back of two sofas and between them to build a custom-made pear box.
The dining corner defines the shades of the floor and painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and the dining corner, the architect used quality marmoleum, moving door revived with a wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen corner, if necessary, is covered by moving panels with a wallpaper.
The new floor of anti-allergic marmolea has a number of advantages compared to the previous of laminate: a soft and non-spark surface and a better sound insulation.
The system of climbs and subjects from a color-marked cardboard is a demonstration of how the panel can work with the space.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted it to be pleasant.
“I like orange, the same shade I had in the previous apartment,” says Ivana.
The graphoscale cover with the motif of a flower magnolia is practical and creates a remarkable aesthetic element.
For a warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which emphasized the modern functional style.
In the small apartment it managed to store books among other things in the space under the window parapets.
Everything is at reach, the lamps are comfortable controlled on a distance.
In the rebuilt interior works a great contrast of the new with the older, for example with a decades old crystal luster and quality art objects that Ivana collects all his life.
The last one came to the kitchen.
The boxes were previously placed on both sides and the owner seemed a little like in a tunnel.
The architect took their numbers and repaid the placement.
Furniture in a simple design is made on order, the white surface is slightly mild by the perle surface.
The small space was built thanks to the idea solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the washing machine.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the full-glass cover of the walls above the workboard.
The unique graphoscle with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is wellined.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
She seems happy here too.
In the original bathroom was a small bathroom and a washing machine, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cover.
The large shower coat has a Ronald glass door.
The task was to create a clear and simple space from the environment, in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
We united the interior material and colorfully and tried its elegant, comfortable, not too overfilled appearance.
"A further condition for the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of items of daily need," added Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has decided that it can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Nečas can also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the August dissolution of the House of Representatives.
He was protected only by the processal immunity that applies to the speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS members, Ivan Fuksy, Mark Šnajdra and Peter Tluchora, on the contrary, decided that they cannot be punished for possible crimes until they gave up their parliamentary mandate in November last year, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig said.
The court with this decision rejected the proposal of Prosecutor Iva Ištvana, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they have accepted a remuneration in the form of lucrative positions in state firms for giving up their mandate and not making problems with the approval of laws.
Instead, the former Prime Minister, who offered them these positions, can also be prosecuted.
A police officer with Vít Bártou was arrested.
Bart’s advocate Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of the VV members, also didn’t want to express too much about the case, but said: “Yes, I represent the client in this case, but given the protection of secret facts, I can’t comment on it further.”
According to the law, the case is addressed by the General Inspection of the Security Corps (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Barta could buy secret information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case could be related to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the post Bárta allegedly sought.
The latest information of the Rights, however, shows that the detention of Vit Barta with Peter Lessy is not related.
Police spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case, saying the case is being addressed by the Prague City Council.
“We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of the secret facts,” Praga City Prosecutor’s spokesman Štěpánka Zenklová said on Friday.
That is where the prosecutor oversees the matter of Bart, and from his words therefore indirectly arises that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in a secret system.
Reporter Novinek managed to find his wife Vita Bárta Katerina Klasnovou in the morning before their residence in Prague's Klárová.
She put her suitcases in the car and went away.
He refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn Movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke about Bart’s arrest.
He says he does not know what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Light of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who in the last premature elections to the House of Representatives in Plzeňsk kraji failed to be a candidate for the Movement Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura, is known for his corrupt cause of paying the members of the Parliament of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was illicitly sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
The judgment was subsequently changed and Barta was released from the charges.
I want a contract in NHL.
Soil, desire and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospala, the family has always been on the first place, so it wants to fully submit to her at her 38 years of age.
He either gets a job abroad and still extends his career, or he definitely ends with hockey.
“I want to play the role of father and husband.”
“I’m looking forward to it,” says the hockey player, who is still waiting for the offer.
Despite the fact that it is a promised worker who never shakes anything.
Despite the fact that on the ice every time he leaves his heart and can throw the co-players.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is always," he declares determinedly.
The New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season, may have two backups injured: Rick Nashe and Ryana Callahana.
How is your arrival to the Rangers?
It’s just speculation.
As long as I don’t have anything on paper, it’s not worth dealing with it.
I know that the article came out in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that’s all.
It was no longer stated that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce myself that I have some contract, but it is simply not so.
Are you not called from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
This is about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When a player is injured or someone can't do it and the manchaft doesn't fall.
There are a lot of different factors that need to gather together to get that contract.
There are similar circumstances in New York, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team failed to enter the season, so there's some chance, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always there.
But the second thing is that you always need two sides.
I would take a lot of offers today, but I have not received any.
This is the reality I have to live in.
You’re going to the United States on Friday, and you’re expecting something to happen?
I have those expectations since July 5, when the free players market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
I’m going to go to Tampa for my children and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and to see you again.
Do you have your program planned?
It is given by the fact that I am a father and a husband, and from that everything is derived.
I’m not a hockey player, I don’t have a contract and I don’t play any games.
So I’m going to play the role of dad and husband and I’m looking forward to it.
It is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time imports?
Of course, you can think of a lot of things.
This can also happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches due to a knee surgery.
I was very much and very much fun.
Once it gets into such a phase that all the goals, victories and drawings will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that is the meaning of life.
Have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could have met besides my family.
Have you had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have that you want to play NHL just because it’s NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - in addition to the family - includes sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
This also leads to family life.
My children, so forgive, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started to go to school there and so on.
And we would be very pleased to continue this trend.
For what we’re going to say, in America the possibilities are completely elsewhere.
We should offer them this opportunity.
Are you planning to stay in America for a long time?
We will practice it as it is so far.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czechs at Hluboké and around the Czech Budějovic.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It is perfect to be always warm.
I had great luck in my life.
It can be said that I went against him, it cost a lot of strength and rejection, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey has offered me a lot of options in return and this is one of them.
We can choose where we will live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have in yourself in your age the will to work hard, to train hard, and to wait for the offer?
This is a question that I cannot answer.
Today I still have it in myself, that juice, that desire, that enthusiasm, that passion for that sport. that desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL, that I am still better than anyone else.
I can’t say how long it will remain there.
It cannot be planned.
So you can say that this season you’ll wait, how it will go out and then you’ll decide what to do next?
I am in the phase where I go day by day.
Recently, the Chief Executive Officer of the CEZ announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th bloc of the Temelín power plant will be delayed to the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and by approving Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current CEZ leadership is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government – that is, the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give the shareholders recommendations, not hide behind it.
The government is with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš begins to reconcile that his “Yes” movement will not have time to learn political crafts in the opposition and that he will have to go directly to the government to make any form.
The President said this in a discussion for the Law, which will come out tomorrow.
Commerce and marketing is led by Abraham.
Its competences include the field of product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Luck Shantor.
For the last 14 years, Abraham has joined his professional career with the automotive sector.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat Czech, where he was responsible for the brand and dealer of Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last workplace was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
Skopin was founded in 1992.
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport due to shooting
A shooting took place at the international airport in Los Angeles in the morning.
Police have evacuated a part of the airport, allegedly the terminal three.
The Reuters agency, referring to the California media, claims that the lawmen shot a gun of a man.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, said that there was a shooting in which two to three members of the Transportation Safety Administration were injured.
How many people were injured, and whether there are victims, is still unclear.
The firefighters are talking about an incident with a greater number of injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft on Thursday allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia.
With reference to the unnamed U.S. government official, it was by CNN.
The Israeli press broadly about the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli army has refused to comment on the news.
“We don’t speak to foreign media reports,” she said.
The target of the Israeli airstrike, according to a U.S. government source, were missiles and related equipment, which, according to the Israelis, could be transferred to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP agency with reference to another U.S. security official that the target of the Israeli airstrike to a target on Syrian territory were the Russian missiles SA-125.
The second channel of Israeli television that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of the attack, however, according to the DPA agency, showed the battery of the Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were said to have seen the batteries of the SA-3 missiles including the command center with the radar to track the missiles and their targets.
The recorded missiles, according to the Israeli television report, are expected to reach 35 kilometers and could carry heads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel hasly bombed missile supplies within Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP said.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will interfere with any supply of weapons intended for Hezbollah or other terrorist groups.
Is the Internet the End of Travel Agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recreators in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit before taxation to range between $325 and $340 million compared to $305 to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current developments areined, it will represent a twelve to seven percent increase against the record profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created eight-percent profit in the first half of the year and the second half began a sharp growth mainly in Australian and British non-profit travel.
“To this date, our 10 countries are profitable and some are moving towards a record annual profit before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our greatest profit makers.
Recreational business has risen in Australia during the second half of the year, compensating the slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business customers spent less.
The U.S. trade has recovered after losses during the seasonal weaker half of the year and is expected to bring third in a row of annual profits.
The shares of the Flight Centre were 3 cents higher at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists arrested in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protests against the planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was today by AFP with reference to the international ecological organization Greenpeace.
She also says that the original allegations of piracy have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil platform were transported from a repair facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the displacement of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned displacement.
The authorities first accused the ecologists of piracy, which threatened them up to 15 years in prison in case of conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that the charges would be replaced by a milder extortion, which threatens a lower penalty with a maximum of seven years of imprisonment.
Greenpeace, however, noted in a statement that the allegations of piracy have not yet been reached as they promised.
This means that the detainees are now accused of two crimes.
The Powerful Investigation Committee last week announced that the allegations of piracy would be replaced by the allegations of piracy.
But when thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the allegations of piracy were not withdrawn.
Instead, a new accusation was raised against everyone,” Greenpeace said in a statement.
Russia arrested three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries in mid-September at Gazprom’s oil platform.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, which flooded under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they are all held in prison, against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Ecologists complain about prison conditions.
Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg will facilitate meetings with the families of the detainees and consular workers.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
“In fact, they may be worse,” he said.
The Dutch king, William-Alexander, was arrested by the activist Faiza Oulahsen.
In a handwritten letter published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, she called on the monarch to talk about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Máliki has a significant part in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is partly part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, ortography and grammatics
At the English literature classes, you will need to study at least one Shakespeare's play, a novel from the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British beletry since 1914.
The exam will also include a “hidden text” to motivate for deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a graduate language exam, and they will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education is expected to release new curricula for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to go through radical change.
Other major changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, which oversee the graduate exam, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduate exam, along with a new system of marking and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his summer speech, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society” and that it is necessary to insist on making the graduate exam “more challenging, more ambitious and more strict.”
The study shows that English schools spend less time in mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year in mathematics and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to spend more time in mathematics, coalition sources said that a comprehensive graduate exam in mathematics – along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the outcome rankings – will likely encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The curriculum will be more focused on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: Cancer is not me
Before the election, the long-touch dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava CSSD was fully burned.
Everything ended up when Ostrava's mayor Petr Kajnar appealed to the court because of the non-democratic composition of candidates.
However, the actors of the case did not want to express too much about it so that they did not hurt the party even more before the elections.
The votes of the voters are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava CSSD so immediately on Monday evening called on the mayor of Ostrava to stand out of the party, and will apparently push for it to lose its position.
But Peter Cayner wants to continue fighting.
What is in the dispute and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Diary.
How do you see the result of the election?
CBS expected a much better outcome.
Did it hurt to us that before the elections the disputes within the party were resolved in the media?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But, on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is now.
It’s the party that has its inner problems, it’s innerly sick and people perceive that it’s not all right in it.
This was clearly revealed in the election.
What are the internal diseases?
For some time, I think the ODS has gone through bankruptcy and, unfortunately, similar things are now happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected their prebends to be found at the ODS, moved to the people in the CSSD and have influence on them.
This is related to the fact that the police go through the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only made up of people who would want the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The CSSD is divided into two unforgivable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between the Haškovs and Sobotkovs.
This has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the election in Ostrava was just a preview of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hashkov’s wing gradually occupied positions so that after the elections it could trigger a situation that will weaken the Sobotkov’s wing.
In politics, people are in a situation where they sometimes have to come to a compromise.
But everyone has some internal boundaries when these compromises can no longer be done, and that’s my case.
Initially I didn’t want to be a candidate for the parliament, but when I saw the whole thing within the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálk that I would try to get to the provincial candidate to strengthen Sobotkov’s wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
But the Hachish wing gave it a stop.
Why do you stand on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Haška?
Slávek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the CSSD program and to a certain extent about the visions for the party and for this country.
I admit that I have not heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hašek is fighting for power.
I don’t understand how a chairman, which is a lower body than the central executive committee, can just begin to withdraw the chairman of the party.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the statutes of the party.
In my opinion, with what Michal Hašek has now shown in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How did you see that the Ostrava leadership did not approve you for the candidate.
Political parties are based on the competition, who will place their members.
The competition should be mainly based on the program vision and the ability of those people to fulfill that vision.
Of course, however, people who do not have the power of capabilities or vision are also involved in this competition, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not get anywhere else.
The problem is when these people begin to get to the forefront due to the fact that they violate the rules without scrupulousness, violate the statutes of the party.
With their practices they make political parties a mafia and, in my opinion, they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Noting this problem is more important to me than taking into account whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
So, did you also submit a proposal before the election to the court for a preliminary measure against the form of a candidate for the CSSD in the Moravskoslezsk region?
The current district executive committee of the CSSD in Ostrava strengthens its power by the fact that the organizations that do not fit him can cancel, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually throw out the uncomfortable members of the party.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he appealed against it and they would rather cancel the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that seeking to comply with the statutes of the party through the courts is the last option, but at the moment that the other methods and control bodies within the CSSD have ceased to work, it is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava CSSD led by the deputy Adam Rykala is to withdraw you from the position of the mayor.
It is a public secret that this post is held by the mayor of Poruby Lumír Palyza.
It’s so, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything to allow me to be revoked.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and for those votes they then strengthen their power in the party.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Basala stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially inscenated so that they could describe me as a man who gives money where he does not belong.
The city has purchased a property that has a strategically important value for it.
What do you think about your stay as a mayor?
The District Committee called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the CSSD.
But I think it’s like a thief crying: “Fake the thieves!”
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, we see no one in Ostrava’s social democracy who would initiate and prosecute, sometimes against the members of the party, the emergence of so many development issues, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
However, everything becomes uncomfortable.
I do not read it otherwise than to prevent others from getting into the places they desire.
Will you continue to fight these efforts?
For if the Republic works well, the political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state when it doesn’t even manage itself.
I don’t think I’m going to leave the CSSD now, because I think that the one who causes the cancer of this party is not me, but those people who try to shake me out.
The city will open a historic centre.
The organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter brushing Pavel Burning said the preparation work on the cluster was started on October 26th and from Wednesday the ice production aggregate is in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters strong and until Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The square has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
The brushers and passengers will also have two stations with a punch.
“We expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that the brushers can comfortably swim,” he described.
The street reminds us of the coming Christmas.
Last year, the cluster was installed right before the main entrance of the municipality on the Upper Square due to the repair of the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people were able to browse directly in front of the municipality in 2009, when the cluster was in operation from January to March.
The ice area has then become an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will be opened on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of an elder will be resolved by the court.
The court has released the charges of a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied the guilt.
They are at risk of 15 to 20 years in prison or an exceptional punishment.
The spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court cancelled the decision of the district and returned the case to him again.
The judge refused to comment on the reasons that led to this, with the fact that the decision was not yet delivered to the parties.
According to the accusation, the young man attacked a 70-year-old man in his house.
The senior died with a sad death.
According to the accusation, the men cut, bite and crawl him throughout the body and also placed him with a metal object, apparently a gas pistol, about three dozen wounds in the head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as breaks in the headache, a stroke in the brain or a bleeding in the brain, which he suffered on the site.
The young people claimed to have taken away about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the district court, the only, in addition, only indirect evidence against the accused were the smell traces that the expert assessed as not fully found in the sense of legal instructions.
The spots from the place of the offence and on other matters, though in more than ten cases agreed with the accused, the police initially treated them as factual and not spots.
There were some errors in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the accused was not undoubted.
However, the court recognised that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead old man with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he probably fell down and wounded himself.
The victim was not by the emergency doctor.
The criminals only after a few days contacted Olomouc doctors who discovered signs of violent death.
Police could no longer work with all the traces from the site of the incident, which the relatives cleaned.
No DNA of the accused was found on the site.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradišťsk.
He is now sentenced to a sentence of 8.5 years, confirmed by the Supreme Court of Olomouc last year.
According to him, he was the head of a group of six young people who are aware of the robbery of the gold industry.
The kidnapping took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of an elderly in Slopny.
The younger of the accused of the murder of the elderly resides in Hungary.
He was released from prison in August after 11 months.
It begins with the reconstruction of the stadium.
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders, who will carry out the reconstruction of the grass.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
Live legend Wayne Shorter closes the shelter week of the Autumn Struny
The saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene, Wayne Shorter, will make the next Wednesday a point behind the 18th anniversary of the Autumn Struna Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6th in the Grand Hall of Lucerne together with his quartet composed by Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter joins the spontaneous jazz improvisation of the PKF – Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumzak.
In Shorter's adaptations for the symphonic orchestra the song Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although this year in August he celebrated his eighty birthday, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert at Strunah autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
The list of interpreters with whom he collaborated ranges from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlose Santana.
On his musical journey he also met with the Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and the Vienna resident Joem Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade indicated the direction of the new fusion style.
For the last 13 years, she has performed in particular with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Afterparty after the festival will be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 in the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the Manchesters trio Go Penguin will be presented with his jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damkov says it prohibits the UEFA to publish penalties for arbitrators.
Dagmar Damková, the chairman of the arbitration committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has ceased to publish the penalties for the judges.
It is prohibited by the UEFA rules, as she said in an interview with the newspaper Law.
Otherwise, it would be a threat of punishment.
Damková also refused to partise the footballers from where she came from.
These speculations are really meaningless.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but the other members of the committee are from somewhere else, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to the criticism that was upset after Plzeň recently played twice as much penalty as the other league teams.
Though in the last few months the FAČR has ceased to publish penalties for the arbitration, Damková assures that the judges are picking for their errors.
"I believe that if the commission finds that the arbitrator has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever it is in any match," Damková said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is, according to Damk, a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes the violations."
“We’re very suspicious and we’re looking for something for every mistake.”
“We’ve published the restrictions, but I’ve got two very strong warnings that if we don’t stop it, there will be severe sanctions,” Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
“We were really an exception,” she added.
If the information would continue to be disclosed, the Commission could lose money from the UEFA for the education and development of arbitrators.
“They are very important to us.”
“Without them we’t be able to complete the program on the education of the arbitrators,” Damková added.
Barta's detention is related to Janush and Bém: Are they behind the escape of hearing?
The head of public affairs, Vita Bártu, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Together with him, the head of the Department of Analysis and Computer Science of the Anti-Corruption Police, Jan Petržílek, was arrested.
The arrest is linked to the hearing of the lobbyist Roman Janouš and former mayor Pavel Béma (ODS).
The information about the submissions, with which the server Novinky.cz arrived, was confirmed by a trusted source to the Czech Press Office.
The listened telephone calls of Janouška and Béma, which last March was published by the newspaper Mladá fronta Dnes and in which both men address each other "Mazánku" and "Kolibříku", show Janoušk's influence on the steps of the city under Bém's leadership.
The journal then that they were purchased by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which they escaped to the security agency ABL two years later.
He owned Barca.
Server Novinky.cz noted that the detained criminal Petržílek worked for the BIS before his arrival to the anti-corruption police.
To the anti-corruption department, which subsequently dealt with, Petržílek passed at the same time when they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of secret information, I can't confirm anything or say anything at all," prosecutor Michal Muravsky from the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague said.
He refused to confirm that he was monitoring the case.
The investigation does not want to comment on the case for the same reason.
Six of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code.
For the coming entry into force of the new Civil Code and the Law on Commercial Companies from 1 January 2014, six out of ten companies are intensely preparing.
Only eight percent of respondents said that the issues related to the two key codes in their company were not solved at all.
This is the result of a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the upcoming date of validity of both key codes, many managers are just now starting to realize how they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law over the past 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Due to the lavery of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty whether revolutionary changes will eventually happen or not.
“Now, however, they have only a few weeks to make the transition to the new law for their companies without complications,” said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spáčil.
Of 61 percent of companies engaged in the new law, 26 percent said their companies have already taken all the necessary measures to prepare them in time.
Moreover, 35 percent of companies of this number are planning to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the contrary, every fifth company with recodification has not yet dealt with, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent don’t have an opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that issues related to recodification have not yet been solved.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent) for the largest number of companies surveyed, followed by the settlement of business conditions (16 percent) and further changes in the real estate register and liability for damages (for ten percent).
For the contracts, one of the most important news of the whole recodification will take place, and that is, the unification of the contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result, the contractual law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
“In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer a lot of news with emphasis on greater freedom of arranging relationships,” said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal lawyer Lukáš Poddaný.
In the context of the Law on Commercial Corporations, almost a quarter of companies consider the most important topic the problem of increasing liability of statutory bodies.
The following are the subjects relating to changes in the convocation and course of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means striking the obligations and possible consequences for the statutory authorities, especially when companies are at risk of bankruptcy or fall into it.
“In practice, this means that if the members of the representatives and corporate executives do not deal with the care of a regular economist and do not reverse the threatening bankruptcy of the company, they can lose the benefits obtained by performing their functions only in the last two years,” Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier's style develop as a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusted relic, explains in an interview for HN his position by Pierre Rainero, style director at Cartier.
This luxury French house was founded in 1847.
It travels through the bay, river and jungle and provides free medical care.
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients.
There are not too many doctors in the West African countries; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Hero Award.
You can vote for him or any of the top 10 candidates in the 2013 CNN Heroes Award competition.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle has been watching his father falling unconscious again and again and riding to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital Yaounde in 1981.
At first he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he formed a hematoma that affected him all his life.
“There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money to do so.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overwhelmed clinics and hospitals, where he received such a treatment that was simply available.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the doctors could visit Cameroon, many would not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty limit and almost three-quarters of the healthcare spending in this country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they can’t enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his peoples suffer, he decided to do something with it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members on the weekend visit rural areas where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush into the supplies, attach medical needs to the roofs, and travel on a hard ground to the villages in need of help.
It is not always accompanied by happiness.
Once upon a time, the vehicles have to push through the river and the shore.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as real heroes: a dinner, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with its broad smile and untouched energy – is very willing to engage in the local joy.
The next day, the team begins treating hundreds of patients.
“On each trip we have 500 patients,” says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a circle of 60 kilometers, and that's by foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a berle or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that the school requires, but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs a simple operation under local narcissism.
Operations are usually done in the school building, in the municipality or at home; after the operation the patient rises and goes to the recovery point to release the place to the next patient.
With the help of light from the generator, the operating room and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and its volunteers work until early morning hours.
It’s exhaustive, but rural musicians usually help the team not lose motivation.
“To stay awake and continue to work, they play the bubbles all night,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot for local residents.
One man said he would be able to work again after the hernia operation.
“This will change the future for our family,” the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, it also works at night for private medical clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s going to sleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He’s always either in the hospital or is trying to get money for the organization to make these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, this is a great practice they't get at home.
“We was thoroughly washing the hands of Dr. Bwell and removing bloody spots, or we kept his instruments,” O’Malley says.
As a student of medicine in the second year in America you will never experience it.
Students volunteers usually pay the trip to Cameroon on their own and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaounde, food, transport and study is provided by Bwelle.
“It’s definitely a hero,” says O’Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant burden is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier, fulfilling the promise he gave to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy to do this job,” says Bwelle.
I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
Smiling people, relieving their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holcát resumes the role of Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The head nurses for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
“I consider it essential that these functions are clearly defined and formalized, that the nurses have their representative within the structure of the office – representatives to whom they can always contact if necessary,” said Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be paid appropriate attention by the ministry.
In the exercise of this profession, it is necessary not only a high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal belief.
“I am pleased and with all my responsibility to try to promote the steps that can improve the position of nurses.”
“We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care sector, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who, with their approach to patients, don’t help us so much to carry out their vocations with all the empathy and help us in the eyes of the public to improve the image of nurses,” says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, on the occasion of her entry into office, also stated that she wants to deal with the various aspects of the job position of the nurse and intends, among other things, to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
“I fundamentally don’t want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but instead I see them standing next to each other, with each one having its own competences and together with other health workers form a joint working team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient.”
“I myself face a number of problems that occur in the exercise of the nursing profession, these difficulties I perceive and I intend to participate in their solutions.”
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative actions unnecessarily burden nurses and take them the time they could and should prefer to spend on patients," said Alena Šmídová.
Other areas it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate in the team and with the management of healthcare providers, adjusting competences and also labour law issues, such as compliance with the Labour Code or not exaggerating nurses with their insufficient number at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous strikes, which, however, are not documented on a specific case where the violation of the rules may occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Chief Sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of the preservation of the anonymity of such complaint and the specific case to be checked by the competent authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Medical School in the field of Nursing (absolved in 1978) and the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Karlovy in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (absolved in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been the head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical disciplines and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bed at the internal department, further worked as a teacher at the Medical School, where she was also a statutory representative of the director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the Chief Sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several specialized curricula and articles in specialized journals, dedicated to lectures in the field of nursing.

Not to get rid of hatred
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel: Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a narrow band, says the number of parties comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
For the Salon Kahudu confessed another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What happened to you when you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so that I didn't get stuck with hatred.
To see around each other new and new clones of that humane madness, young organisms affected by the blind selfish effort.
About us older, I don’t even speak, the ksichty ruined by the impotent desire, the wicked souls, and the opposite overwhelming ideologists, who try to sell their “product” with the expression of a small selling prostitute.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jurious friends, strangers and hidden formations.
I have passed it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burns from life on this planet.
I prefer to go on a walk, and then I read a book at the lighthouse.
You’re talking about a sense of hatred, hatred.
Has there been a breakthrough in the past that has affected you, or are you just getting older, like we all?
The breakthrough happened a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It had no name then.
And then I lived.
Somewhere inside there is still a silent boy.
I see another lonely worker, everyone in their torrents of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I will take part in that huge, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet—the birth of the untouchable future.
The immense, breathing complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir of our present.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game, where the way of attempt-errors arises the next and next generations of beings, who in billions of interactions per second create some supernatural, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years are a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or have you started completely from zero?
A dialogue, or rather a dialogue, led by the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows to the level and forms itself in a book.
As the period of peace is overwhelmed by silently sleeping metastases of wars that may one day wake up – so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt that my brain was growing, and if I didn’t do anything, one day I would be silently overwhelmed.
It is a set of questions that the brain formulates and puts them to layers that are stored in the darkness "under the level of consciousness".
Neocortex, the grey cortex of the brain, asks older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient centuries of the brain tree.
He speaks to the harsh beasts, asks the serpents, seeks answers in the flight of birds, lifts his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star heaven above me.
The brain is asking the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically – could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branched trees of information, records of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to constantly changing presence, in the untouching effort it tries to name and understand its surroundings and decode important communications.
Sometimes there are disorders of overload.
Similarly - as if you "falled" the PC, from the program of the speech emulator and translator from foreign languages you would get confused first in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restartes ended at the dark-green blinking screen of the Bios, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what it’s about – I’m talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You’re talking about it often – why are you interested in this type of regression regularly?
Because it is JAMA.
In the so far functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a breakthrough will appear.
Here it is good to find Nietzsche: "He looked in the gap so long that the gap looked in him."
It breaks the feeling - that a person is lost, if all hopes disappear, psychically "death" and a new quality comes up.
Why do I be interested in it personally?
I will answer with similarities.
Once one fell into the tone and drowned, days, months, and years were running, he still drowned and read, and those books taught him to swim, that is, to live.
He became a “dive”.
I hope someone will help some of the sentences I have written, as Hrabal's texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one of whom nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it’s best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
From his early youth he read the books of ancient Czech fairy tales, swim in the captain Nema submarine, running through the Stínadlech in the dark streets.
The same end, behind all the branches of the authors and their message, is: "The sun bright of the worlds of other Karl Hynk Makhy."
What if the book is out?
Are you interested in the reader’s opinion?
On the feedback that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And even then, after years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
In fact, books are “life” or rather “worlds.”
They are encoded into the characters of the letters, they carry the experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can wake them up to life whenever we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It is actually, in its way, something prohibited divine - awakening more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
This is a fact whose DNA is stored in the line - according to ancient demonological books we do witch.
After the book is published, a chain of authors' readings awaits you.
I remember you once liked reading.
Do you feel happy again or do you feel different after years?
I prefer to tell it today.
What did I find out?
There are smart people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are untouched, they don't pay too much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiations, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give an example - in the town of the Red Church lived was (and I hope it's still alive) one curved bookstore (named it conveniently Juvenka), a joyful companion and a good girl bear.
At one drink, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book.
I looked at them in the eyes and then I was shown a scattered, scattered copy of my book.
In disappointment, I dropped the just broken morning and shortly manly cryed.
We all stood quietly there, swallowed and drunk with tears.
Then that young blonde mixer did not stand up, and with a scream he jumped out of his head from the window into the snow cage.
It was on the floor.
We escaped into the night landscape and killed by the happy anger of the sensitive, the painful souls of the peasants, and the trouble of the afflicted patriots—they went out and walked like wolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and contently different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It is a story.
It is a story of one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novel Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts the words of one old Russian fairy tale into the mouth of the people’s healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There is a dog, a gray box on it.
Horrors, horrors and secrets.
This has never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
Maybe we’ve been a long time the devils in hell and loosed – what role we’re going to play on this earth.
Are you planning to continue writing, or are you leaving it on a free flow of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otakar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something of enormous and unnamed, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, affects our desires from such a depth and in such a width that it completely exceeds our horizon – and so with absolute self-evidence we act precisely in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded by the flow of dopamine, endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to pair, we die in defense and the acquisition of new personal territories.
Sometimes there is a disorder and we shine compassion.
Only then we have the right to call ourselves people.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, stands on the coast of the ocean of unconsciousness and captures the floods of wet wind into the dirted shift made of a dirty pocket.
I have to write to be a man.
Obama resigns from healthcare
After a wave of criticism, President Obama retired yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can leave it.”
With reference to hundreds of thousands of statements of dismissals from suppliers, the Republicans have accused the president in recent days of cheating the U.S. public.
Mr. Obama has failed from his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Given what he called a “media shock” about the statements, Obama called on the Americans who received these statements to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive healthcare program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You’ll get a better offer,” he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Act on Available Care.
“I say this to these Americans straight: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in a statement to the Washington Energy and Trade Committee.
Sebelius, who supervises the implementation of the Law on Available Care, said the launch of the internet market has been “bad” since October.
“I’m disappointed and angry like everyone else,” she said.
I will try to get your confidence back.
Angry Sebelius spoke this sentence, captured by the microphone, yesterday to the adviser sitting behind her at the committee's yesterday's meeting, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a Missouri representative, on whether she should be involved in Obama's care program.
More than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly touched the question why the “architect” of the Available Care Act did not voluntarily give up the government-sponsored insurance, and did not buy the program through HealthCare.gov, which is now imposing millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from the agencies and behind the scenes, it is said already a hand in the hand.
The announcement of the transaction is expected to come in November, probably before the opening of the LTE frequency auction, that is, before November 11.
Kellner’s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
The company under the brand Sazka Telecommunications has launched a frequency auction for LTE networks.
And that to the general surprise, until then, the company’s desire to penetrate in telecommunications was not spoken.
But Sazku is now led by a very experienced telecommunications mazac Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing chief of Radiomobil (today T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovak T-Mobil and last headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up to the auction and now admitted she wants to launch a virtual with Vodafone.
It gives logic.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator into its network.
This would probably not like Vodafone in normal circumstances, but according to the Economic Newspapers, it may be part of much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing O2 and T-Mobile operators that will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that may be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender on LTE networks (as a newbie can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, respectively, it will not bother the auction of a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will put Sazku into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at a frequency of 900 MHz), allowing the company a quick start of the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building a costly LTE network that Vodafone will be able to use.
Both companies are satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the savings for some Internet or cable television provider.
And Kellner?
The one to buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovenian branch is the daughter of the Czech) has obtained an immediate full-value operator with still worthy profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it’s a big mole that will wait for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would be acquired by Kellner for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobil.
The two companies have already announced that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally end with a success, but quite likely not with the high amounts that the state budget enjoys.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobil, Kellner or Komárk.
Or two titanes of the Czech business against the global giants.
Will Czech TV ever run without signature events?
In the era of President Zemana, she entered a legendary scene with a popcorn, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that gather documents of the castle group.
In the past translated influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík no one documented this way, even to sign under it.
The leadership was supported by the editors.
The cases described, however, don’t give an answer to the question, from where such inclination of some journalists to the landlords comes – whether it is a response to a direct order, or, not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of unlocal empathic affection.
And when we already assume a general tenderness, we cannot forgive the question of whether other, not less scrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity, do not strive to change the circumstances on television.
The truth is that those who say that in developed countries there is no intense attempt to intervene politicians in broadcasting.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there would be no complaints on public media.
The prosecutors do not question their independence.
They, on the contrary, criticize mainly what they consider a tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subcultures.
Per we have not yet reached this stage of civilization, and this situation is not in us.
But even in a country that he thinks is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of the unclear situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings is affected.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of this country: Presidents on the edge of forces
It is almost a rule that at key times the country was not the head of the state in such a form that it could fulfill its state duties.
If T. Masaryk was physically and mentally five years younger, the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would be a little different.
We would probably not win the war, but after a symbolic resistance, the air force could fly beyond the borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed and the government could flee to London immediately and not work there for its legitimacy.
And most of all, the nation would not have a covet until today.
Beneš was not a stateman, and during Munich he was still in condition, but during the wars it began to go with him from the hill and in February 48 he kept according to that.
Being a little better, he could go to exile for the third time and break down the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It’s a shame to talk about Hathaway.
He was elected with the saying that "the president does not get into a situation that he would decide."
But he had to, though big decision it with a knife on the neck at Hitler in the chancellor's was not.
The head of intelligence František Moravec until the last days in March 1939 said what all should be done so that the occupation he knew on the day exactly did not go so smoothly and with such a profit to the Germans.
The Senate president and the cowardly government did nothing, on the one hand they didn’t believe him, on the other hand they feared.
The human fossil Gottwald let his flying companions be executed, as Moscow ordered him.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely unlikely to participate in normalization and they had to put it down, already completely senile.
That Husak was an impotent and sick depressive old man of the events in November 89 made it easier, but that’s the only thing.
Havel was lucky that he was not met in office in the last years, he was saved from the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis retireer, but many of his behaviors suggest that the thought processes are no longer the same as they were.
Now here we have this.
The head of state and the top commander of the armed forces look like it looks and we don’t know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic.
Or it may be threatened, but it is not so seen.
Then the question is whether exceptionally it is not (historically) good that the president is not completely at power.
This is not a normal state.
Would we not be able to elect a president in this country once again, someone acceptable and acceptablely healthy?
Far planets, black and white movies or a little fantasy about alien life on Earth are not the topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would overthrow.
In the concept of his quartet, which on 6 November in the large hall of Prague Lucerna will finish this year’s festival Struny autumn, it’s all related to everything.
The quarter of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
According to his task, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised camera matter and have to think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is unlikely to be explained by the newly eighty-year-old Shorter – an extraordinary composer, nine Grammy winners, Miles Davis’s former co-player and today’s probably the greatest live jazz saxophonist.
He doesn’t talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty, I came to the opinion that the best thing to do is to let life be surprised.
“There’s too many people plan everything and then they’re disappointed when things go differently,” Shorter says.
How Insects from Thailand Raised Sales in the Paris Bar
Maybe you’re crazy over the insect and you don’t know that you eat about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For instance, broken in the flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and a unique experience you have also taken care of.
The insect offer was ranked the first in Paris on the business’s meal list at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
The bar, for which the name was inspired by William Burrough's book The Naked Lunch, you'll find in the fashionable 18th district near Montmartre a widespread tourist.
With fresh avocado, baked red peppers, zinc and cranberry eggs, guests can newly gush not only different larva, cabbage or water brows, but also taste the cranberries.
Carefully and specially packed supplies (so that the insect is not damaged by the wings, the legs or the eyes are not damaged) are sent to Daviron only from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneering menu lists a few reasons why to consume insects.
The first of them is the environmental benefit, as insect production is much less expensive for our planet (as regards finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
“In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids,” Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
“I don’t save the world, I’m just mediating a new experience,” he explained.
Far from not everyone would probably be excited by the idea of how a pest-decorated brooke is consumed, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to the served insect are, according to the owner, very positive.
Even the skeptics say they will eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest soasts and finally choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tastes range from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: The new green savings should continue
The Czech construction industry has since 2008 faced a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the State’s lack of interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in each region.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measures, will save significant amounts for heating, but also opportunities for construction firms and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state are significant leap and multiplication effects, it is also one of the most important growth measures.
The Union of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government's resolution and calls for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the program, so that further challenges could be declared within the framework of it.

The dog summarized the carpet, the president buried and ended with the berries
President Miloš Zeman on Thursday left the motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night on bed, and went to the castle in Lánech.
In what health condition is it?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that U.S. spying "goed too far"
John Kerry suggested a weakening of the U.S. defense attitude regarding its tracking programs, and in an unprecedented confession he said that in some cases spying "goed too far."
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for acting as an “autopilot” in view of the narrow revelations about NSA’s spy activity, which appeared thanks to informator Edward Snowden.
The information published caused a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry via a video-link at the open government conference in London said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some things that were happening from persistence, because there was the possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and then of course, September 11.”
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying crossed the border, but stressed that it was not violated destroying rights.
He said, “In some cases it’s gone too far.”
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify it to the people, and now he is conducting a thorough review so that no one has the feeling that there has been a misuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is seeking good and that its tracking operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to explode themselves.”
In the world there is a radical extremism that is firmly determined to kill and throw people into the air and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft from falling, buildings not exploding, and people were not executed, because we are already able to learn about these plans in advance.
The Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are going to Europe to respond to foreign concerns related to alleged U.S. spying, and convinced Europeans that it is necessary to continue to unite their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and other persons this week and that he was worried about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disappointed by the National Security Agency (NSA) monitoring.
For the U.S. national security interests, it is truly important that Europe remains on one boat with us, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for Foreign Affairs for European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I am going to Europe to clearly show that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over the NSA programs.
The news in the media that the NSA had collected millions of telephone records in Europe, disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that the NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another revelation cited documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was monitoring the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the allies’ spying as necessary and said it was a common matter from both sides.
Meanwhile, Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, and hopes that members of both parties and the Chamber will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to participate will be published.
He said the program is still working.
Although Murphy said the goal of the journey is to help repair relationships, he added that “good-minded educational measures” will also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize that we are not the only one who is spying here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to go to the Middle East and to Poland this weekend to respond to the misery caused by the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. monitoring activity.
Australian woman appeals against staying in Thai prison
A twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to fifteen days in prison on the island of Phuket when she falsely claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on guarantee.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 by a district court on the island of Phuket for a false accusation when the Thai police said that a taxi driver and two other men who allegedly arrested her had attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, a record from the industrial television later revealed that after she divorced with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The police on Phuket Island had talks with Bamford for two days before she knew she had invented the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-warming repair facility in the periphery of Phuket, instead of placing her in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunk, who in the case of his daughter asked for assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sydney newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
“Obviously this is a challenging period, but we hope they will come back to us safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the sentence and was released with a guarantee of 50,000 bahts.
Australia reports that she has spent a vacation in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but said she was warned that the appeal could lead to a court proceedings that would increase her punishment and result in placing in prison for adults.
However, after the recent assassination of the Australian travel agency Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to repair the scattered image for tourists, which was probably behind a liberating verdict.
A lot of jokes: a goal from the bridge?
In the defence zone he got a puppy and no one captured him.
Furthermore, the escape transformed after a fast forhend clay.
Jaromír Jágr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday evening the 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
“After watching this video, the director of the Czech roads called to my agent Peter Svobod and asked him if I had no interest in advertising their most modern train Pendolino!”
We are typically very similar.
I’m sure I’ll have to finish my night training so that I don’t get faster.
"I'm afraid that then the defense minister could call and would want to make an advertisement on the trickers!" he added.
New Jersey won a second victory in a row.

The place of the candle candle
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a lot of losers.
They are not only the parties that did not enter the House of Representatives (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the CSSD because of their internal breakdown.
Instead of the holidays, politicians served us a holiday candle in the weekend.
The jump of the elections became the Andrey Babiš movement, who promised voters to change the current political style of governance.
The breakdown of the election result and the breakdown in the winning party record the political (z)will of Mr. President Miloš Zemana regardless of the wishes of voters who the party that President Zeman publicly supported did not even elect to the parliamentary parliament.
The president has lost his strategic advance over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, but there are still a few ways to get him back – for example by choosing a future prime minister.
While the CHSSD’s chances of obtaining the prime chair in my eyes are far away, the entrepreneurs Andrey Babiš, on the contrary, are approaching.
The electoral development is still a mile away from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the leftist government supported by the Communists, this development is a better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Due to the loud resistance of ANO to go together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the coalition of CSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 members).
Given the breakdown in the CSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak partner in negotiations, the result of the coalition talks can be quite scary for the CSSD.
The minority government of the CSSD composed of "non-landers" in the castle probably won't pass.
Furthermore, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may, sooner or later, lead to further dissolution in the party.
So I ask myself, “Do we not wait for the next early elections?”
The next election would rather be a referendum on the power of the voting mandate of the ANO movement.
The plans for the implementation of sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or the construction of the state bank have fallen hopefully under the table.
The CSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Dawn parties, on the contrary, agree, for example, on the promotion of business, the alternate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of the employment of disadvantaged persons, the reduction of the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Third areas are most present in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
Yes now has the top, so the program for now the most likely coalition yes, CSSD, KDU-ČSL would tend rather to the right.
That is, in my opinion, a better result than the left-wing program with tax on everything that is still moving in the economy.
