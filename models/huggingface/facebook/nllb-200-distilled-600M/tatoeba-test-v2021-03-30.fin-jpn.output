You got the hang of it?
I'm totally broke.
Tom sat on the couch.
What do you do in your free time?
I'll bring my little sister next time I come.
He was cut yesterday.
Ten years is a long time.
Tom stared at the dictionary on the upper deck.
You're sparing water.
I've never tasted a mango before.
I was angry.
Can you start by giving me a three-minute presentation of yourself?
Tom is social.
Welcome to our house!
Can you give me a ride to the station?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Can you lift this upstairs for me?
I think you lied to Tom.
Have fun!
Her mother is a very talented pianist.
She's a good-hearted woman.
10°C.
Yesterday it rained.
Tom has toothache.
Why would I want to eat ice cream when it's so cold?
He made her his wife.
What's wrong?
It's not wine. It's grape juice.
He realized that it was difficult to please his father.
I don't want to say that reality is just what I understand.
Can you tell me how to get there?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He'll be here soon.
Why do people go to the movies?
Whose umbrella is this?
My mother doesn't speak English very well.
I got a mat in the corn.
Come home now.
He went to Italy to study music.
Tom said he thought I wouldn't win.
You don't have to apologize, Tom.
Tell me where Puerto Rico is on the map.
I don't want to go out tonight.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The child has not yet been found.
Don't worry about it.
Come here, I wanna show you something.
We are a family of five.
I think birthdays are important.
I have nothing to take away.
That's why I'm here?
Can I have a glass of milk, please?
I guess so.
Be careful driving.
I'm going to take a bath first.
There are many wildlife in this area.
I like fish more than meat.
I'll take care of it.
You know what to do if there's a fire in the building?
Fuck you!
Jake is three years older than me.
He's never been late for school.
He's never been abroad.
I'm worried about you.
Oh, my God.
The speaker's claim was irrelevant.
That's all for today.
I'd love to have another chance to talk to you.
We got up at 10:00.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
I'm accurate.
You're just gonna be standing there all day?
Teach this poem outside by next week.
You gave the key to Tom?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Complaining doesn't help.
How should I eat this?
I can't sing as well as Mary.

You forgot the money?
I eat breakfast every morning.
Kissing a smoker is like licking a ashtray.
Why are you so tired?
Please wait in the waiting room.
Tom made a fortune in crude oil.
You're going out on a cold day like this?
I have a headache.
What is the soul?
Tom, what time are you in Boston?
It's time to go!
When do we eat?
That's a good idea.
Thank you for listening to me, even though you're busy.
There's no chair in this room.
Dvořákin's Slavic Dances were originally composed for four-handed piano, but the composer himself later arranged them for orchestra.
I'm a practical person.
Thank you for coming by tonight.
Are you really gonna eat that whole thing?
He's a good person.
Can you show me something else?
Heavy rain prevented us from going fishing.
What did Tom know?
Get a doctor on the scene right away.
Can you advise me to the station?
Tom's favorite way to spend a weekend is to stay home and read a book.
I think you're hiding something.
I hate this weather.
Get here at exactly 6:00.
Truck was standing in the middle of the road.
Today is Monday.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Tom is drowned.
Pretty soon, I'm sure, there's gonna be a day when man can go to Mars.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I can't take this anymore.
Can you use a computer?
Don't talk about it in front of him.
What did Jean make?
Where are you going?
I understand that in a way.
Tom often misses meals.
Tom is dying.
I came to apologize for yesterday.
He has no idea how important this meeting is.
I'm sorry, but I'm not feeling well.
He's shy and always stays behind.
He overcame his difficulties.
Permit me to stay, please.
I'm coming right now.
I don't use Mixi at all these days, which is why I play games sometimes.
I'll help you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that.
Nearby, I thought I was under the car.
Are they Japanese?
He went to the French capital, Paris.
Which do you like, apples or bananas?
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to Lincoln Center?
I have no choice.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can you tell me how to get there?
I have to go now.
You gonna help me now or not?
I thank you with all my heart: thank you!
Tom was asleep.
I wish the weekend could come soon.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Have you written all the New Year's cards?
He died before I got there.
I'm going straight to the point.
Can I interrupt?
Can I go?
Write your address on this.
Kati hasn't come yet?
Tom's mother was a singer.
Don't worry about it!
I don't like that kind of thing.
Turn off your cigarettes. Smoking is forbidden here.

I'm sorry you had to wait so long.
Seems a little bit of a hoot.
I'm totally open.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Papa told us it was definitely true.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He bought his son a camera.
Wish me luck.
I only learned the truth for the first time yesterday.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom didn't know that Mary had decided to quit her job.
I'm glad I was able to help you last week.
Tom is a bad athlete.
He's the last person I wanna meet.
The news that the earthquake occurred was later proven true.
The fog didn't show the soul of the soul.
The worst part is that he thinks he's bad.
I asked him where to park.
I'm not scared now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom was stuck in his mouth.
Can you bring us the bill?
Are you sure he's breathing?
Can I borrow this pen?
He's very attractive.
Have fun!
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.
Next time, I'm gonna take my little sister with me.
Kiss me!
Don't worry.
I think this is gonna be helpful.
Tom said "Sorry" for the tears in blue.
I'm leaving in an hour.
I'm the fastest runner.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
You studying?
If you have any questions, ask me anytime.
Tom's wedding?
I have nothing to do with that case.
I hate Tom.
Yamamoto is one of my friends.
She's had five children.
If you wanna ask a question, raise your hand.
What kind of eggs do you want?
Tom drowned in his eyes.
You have no right to judge these people.
I am firmly opposed to corporal punishment.
Why did he ask for so much money?
Tom ran away from the classroom.
Tom didn't live long.
Eat too much is bad for your health.
Tom didn't expect to fall in love with Mary.
If you don't like it, go home.
Can you close the door?
Tom speaks English with a French accent.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

I'll show you the car I just bought.
This morning is beautiful too, because I'm with you.
I should have come yesterday.
Tom is thirty years old.
Don't drink when you eat soup.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The dog's name is Ken.
I don't know what it's like.
When we came back, we stopped at the grocery store to buy food, which is that being well prepared doesn't mean you're sad.
Get him!
You can do it.
There's no one who knows the truth.
I don't have any money.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Get on the bus.
I'm sorry about that.
Talk about the weather, or the food at the party, or your favorite drink.
How long are you planning on staying in Boston?
What would you like to do?
I found it!
We each paid our own share of the food costs.
When he pulled his hand off the girl's hands, his voice got louder.
Jon made his business work.
I think you'd better start a diet.
This is the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen.
I'm wearing a green sweater.
This town ain't alive.
Can I have another beer?
Tom has friends all over the world.
If your lover finds out, then that's it.
It's cold.
Get up!
I'll follow you.
I've been thinking about how to rhythm my performance properly.
Who is he?
It's cold.
I'd rather be fooled than cheat someone else.
Tell me about it!
I'm prescribing you a medication.
That cat's pretty fat.

Don't point your gun at me.
I got up a minute ago.
Tom has friends all over the world.
Have you got a weekend?
Excuse me, but I'm looking for a book called Tom and Mari.
I need your help.
What did you do last weekend?
Tom spread a peanut butter on the bread.
I'd like to learn to play guitar.
Get in the circle and hold each other's hands.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm awfully tired.
The more individual each person is, the more he contributes to the wisdom of others.
Tom always complains about Marin's money.
That's the kind of thing that lives up to its own flaws.
We'd probably better not tell Tom about today.I agree.
He's a good man.
Where's the exit?
Are everyone there? Wait, where's Tom? He said he was asleep at the bomb and that's why he's half an hour late.
Miko doesn't have shark on Monday.
Use this.
There's no other fool than an old fool.
I made Tom angry.
I have to find a new nanny.
Tom is a woman's laughingstock.
Have fun!
Have fun!
I've got a lot to do today.
He's on the phone now.
Sorry I can't do anything for you.Nothing, just being there, is good enough.
Because he's honest, I like him.
Nice to meet you.
Nobody knows where he's gone.
My mother was a wonderful person.
He told the truth.
The better you know her, the more you'll like her.
Tom is underweight.
Do you like to dance?
He went to Italy to study music.
Put your coat on, it's cold outside.
You should check with your doctor.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can you get me some sugar?
Do you like San Francisco?
Excuse me, can I borrow a pencil?
Let's do it together.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom spread a manzanilla on a piece of bread.
I can swim.
Can you wake me up tomorrow at 6:00?
Tom previously worked for a big company in Boston.
Tom must be angry.
Take some fruit, please.
All this is yours, if you want it.
Yeah, I got it. I'll be back in 20 minutes.
What is the difference between religion and philosophy?
They demanded a raise.
Tom likes to swim.

I'm on my way.
Nothing was seen.
He was never satisfied with his own success.
You're going too far!
Where do you wanna go?
Ville is two years older than me.
Get out there and play some sports.
Beware, there's a truck coming!
The painting looks very much alive.
I'm happy to introduce myself briefly.
Are you all right?
I don't wash my hair in the morning.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm in a hurry with my homework.
He keeps a diary in English.
I'll be right back.
Ken is happy.
It's too late.
Can you talk a little slower?
I wanna stay here as long as I can.
Tao when iron is hot.
The grass is greener on the other side of the fence.
Can you not smoke for a week?
J.F. Kennedy was buried in Arlington Cemetery.
Where are you going?

I don't like being laughed at my expense.
Where does Tom live?
Where are you going?
The doors collapsed and he fell.
I hear the new English teacher is a handsome man who looks like Tom Cruise.
When can you meet him?
The room was dark.
That's the voice of Baba.
The rumor that the company is going bankrupt is spreading.
Ask someone else.
Who is that?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You in a hurry?
I have a birthday tomorrow.
I don't have a computer at home.
He's causing us a lot of trouble, but I like him anyway.
Do you want to meet me?
If you don't take a decisive stand with the children, you'll lose control of the situation.
Are you in a bad mood?
That's almost impossible.
I just got a visitor. Can you hold on a second?
It's a beautiful day.
Tom, can I copy your math lesson?
Excuse me, did you have to wait?
Its house is across the bridge.
What time does the movie start?
Mary was looking for you a moment ago.
I'm only gonna give him a second chance once.
Bird sings.
The elderly must be respected.
He's really smart.
The wound is wet.
I don't know the spelling of this word.
This bird can't fly.
Japanese headshells look just like apples.
Beware of angry dogs!
I'm convinced of that.
Don't leave your baby crying.
I'm doing it because it's important.
What you lack is tenacity!
Tom pretended not to hear anything.
I didn't understand why he was curling his horns at her.
I don't want to eat out tonight.
Why do you like me?
I don't have work on Sunday.
Have you ever been to Boston?
Tom will do anything to be sparing.
He told her he loved her.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What's the nearest planet to the sun?
He's smart.
Tom works hard.
I don't need any friends. They won't let me down.
How much is this watch?
I like that answer.
Get up!
Tom fell into the mud.
I'm awfully fat.
Can you tell me how to get to the beach?
Full of water?
I'm screaming hungry now because I didn't eat lunch.
You must be a complete idiot.
I'm taking two days off.
I'm looking forward to the summer.
I wish he were here.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Who knows?
My mother is proud of me.
Thank you for listening to me. I said a lot about it.
Birds singing.
Calm down now.
Have fun!
You're not kidding me anymore!
How would you like your eggs?

The painting looks exactly right.
We need to talk about Tom.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
They were taking turns.
The girl's face lit up when she heard the boy's words.
The audience I expected was greater than the audience I expected.
Tom often goes to school on a bicycle.
I had a birthday yesterday.
We waited a long time, but he didn't show up.
Black feels awful!
Tom played the piano.
Has he contacted you lately?
It's awfully cold today.
I washed my hands of the whole thing.
I have to study mathematics.
He's a good speaker.
How many hours did you go to bed last night?
Tom got on the train.
My father speaks both English and French.
What would you do if you won the lottery?
You don't have to apologize, Tom.
What are earrings for?
I'm sorry, I accidentally dropped my eating knife.
Is there anything alive on Mars?
When I grow up, I'm going to marry Tom.
Whose umbrella is this?
I like reading thrillers.
Whose car is this?
Look at this!
Let's get some food.
Can you hold on a second?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Excuse me, but can we have another bottle of wine?
Are all travel arrangements ready?
Tom is confused.
Thank you so much for your concern! You are truly the kind of friend that needs to be held.
Tom is there.
He was up late.
You're a Japanese student?
Maybe, see you tomorrow!
Are you waiting for someone?
Get down!
Tom is used to talking to children.
He went to Germany to study medicine.
Don't worry about it.
Let's finish this first.
Then don't drink this water.
That's not fair.
If you're ready, eat fruit.
Can you suggest a route to the Tokyo Tower?
Tom has a son who just turned three.
Please sit down.
There was no soul of the cross on the way.
Tom is sworn single.
Why are you so angry?
Tom said he thought that Mary would still live with her parents.
Cherry blossoms are in April.
What does that mean?
The meeting ended earlier than usual.
Why me?
Who is Tom's girlfriend?
I've already had lunch.
Generally speaking, nothing is as scary as the unknown.
Just wanna know what time Tom's gonna be there.
Why would he do something like that?
I'm going fast.
He was fired only because he refused to lie.
What happened?
When he learned that there were no books, paper, or pencils in school, he wrote the letters down on the ground with a stick.
Tom's clothes are out of fashion.
My brother lives in San Diego.
You haven't had lunch yet?
I rarely walk to work.
The news of the accident came as a terrible shock to me.
What's the car?
Tom is easy to make friends with.
The sun is setting behind the horizon.
Tom speaks things by the right names.
Two of my friends are professional singers.
Tom shouted his whole lung.
I want to be a part of it.
I have one more question.
Personally, I believe that corporal punishment is a necessary evil.
The newborn baby is waving nervously.
He just left.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom teaches us French.
Well, I'm in a hurry now.
What do you think is in this box?
I'm not home this afternoon.
The smoke is a symbol of peace.
I don't like that kind of thing.
Can I have a coffee, please?
I'll borrow books from the city library.
What's in that cupboard?
When Mary saw Tom naked, she started laughing.
Tom is not interested in politics.
I'm sick of this heat.
I shave my chin and shave every morning.
Don't get up!
Come and sit down, please.
I can swim.
You speak French very well.
That's a good idea!
How deep?
Everything is ready.
I didn't know what I should do.

Can I leave a message?
Good night.
The politician first became famous as an actor.
If I win the lottery, I can have a sweet life.
Apels in a day keep the doctor away.
My uncle is angry.
I decided to tell him I loved him.
You all right?
Can you tell me how to get to Lincoln Center?
I'm tired, it's been a rough day.
I watched TV this morning.
Love is madness.
I'm off to work.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Do you have any friends in Australia?
Roman history is very interesting.
Wait a minute.
That's all you're saying?
Are you looking for something?
If you notice any errors, you can correct them.
Tom is not at all happy to be there.
What's that sound?
Tom took a bus to Boston.
I wanna watch TV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He made his parents happy.
Tom has a bad way of biting his nails.
You're not drinking from a bottle.
Have you got an English menu?
Rainbow has seven colors.
Tom cut the apple into thin slices.
Tom is the tallest in his class.
I don't know what's so delicious about the beetle.
The earth is blue, just like my orange.
No jump for good, no rush for honor.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm a family of five.
Now calm down!
It's all right.
That's a good idea!
He's a very rich man.
His uncle runs that hotel.
Are you American?
I like reading deckers.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
"I can't think in that way", he said, staring at the typewriter.
Why did you decide to go to Australia for an exchange?
The family had a hard time after the war.
Sit down and start telling me.
Tea, please.
Bird is circling.
I want a ventilator.
See you later.
A moment.
I'm a baker.
What's the difference between a mini-hime and a micro-hime?
Stay down!
Don't worry about it!
Tom ought to apologize to Mary for not arriving on time.
You've never been in love, have you?
I have to go now.
I want to quit school.
Can I have another can of beer?
What he told us a while ago makes no sense.
How's school going?
Tom is always happy.
You see?
Come under my umbrella.
This kid's teeth are just coming out.
Have you got any money?
Thank you!
How many Canadian friends do you have?
No rule without exception.
Tom has never eaten raw horse meat.
When I was in high school, I woke up at 6:00 every morning.
Tom, how old were you living in Australia?
I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I want to eat!
A rather large crowd was planning to come with us to the water slide, but nobody showed up.
I thought I understood it, but when I thought about it again, I realized I didn't understand it.
Give me your paperwork.
This is too small.
I think I failed.
The dog barked.
You'd better get some sleep.
His arms and legs are long.
Tom dances.
Who baked this cake?
It's too late.
I don't like to see the interest on Twitter. I don't like to see it.
I was unfortunately absent when you visited me last night.
He just turned 20.
Wait till 6:00
I have a daughter.
I didn't order this.
Can you have some time on Friday?
I'm glad you found these clothes.
What's my fault?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I was angry.
Tom is unphotographic.
Chris is coming.
He drives very carefully.
When he was on his way home, he was robbed.
Tom knows?
I'm going to stay in town.
I'd write him a letter if I only knew the address.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom watched that photo.
That's weird.
Use a gun.
Have you ever given blood?
What do you think of this shirt?

I can't take this pain any longer.
Tell me about your plan.
See you at school tomorrow!
He had some problems with her before.
Tom is sleeping on the living room couch.
Tom, how many cell phones do you have?How many?You mean people have more cell phones?I have four.What do you mean?
Tom is my brother.
Tom is a very honest person.
When the rain is over, we'll leave.
A corner of the room was covered with a nice pile of books.
Who are you waiting for?
You're gonna write notes on everything he says.
Get your socks off my leg.
I'm sorry, I forgot about that.
Take some fruit, please.
I don't wanna go to school today.
Doctors should be up to date on the latest medical developments.
Are you still angry?
I'm going to bake a cake for Mary's party.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom got his ribbon back.
You went somewhere on your summer vacation?
Tom carefully opened the box.
I'll make you some tea.
Which is better, white wine or red wine?
Kati is the smartest student in her class.
Have you ever been to Boston?
The building that you can see over there is our church.
I've had enough!
Theory and practice never meet.
There was a little water left at the bottom of the bottle.
Can you stay a little longer?
I didn't notice it, to be honest.
It's a joke.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Tom, hurry up.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He likes ice cream.
Why are you so tired?
I realize that life without love is impossible for me.
I think that's a good idea.
Have you got money?
He complained about being treated unfairly.
What do you want me to ask Tom?
Pressing this button and the door opens.
Let's go get some food.
Over-eating is not good for your health.
Did you hear the news on the radio?
You hate me?
Have you prepared for the trip?
Come again.
If you're a good girl, I'll give you some names.
Ken has two cats.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'll pay you.
How would you like your eggs?
You can't have both.
Why is this bird called?
Nearby, I thought I was under the car.
Well, I have a headache.
Wash before first use.
Tom speaks French just like a Frenchman.
Get on with it!
How long before winter?
I bought a watch.
Can I borrow a pencil?
I'm totally screwed.
What did you see?
I want you to return the book I lent you a while back.
I convinced him to go to the doctor.
In this situation, mistakes will happen.
I'm eating an apple.
Nothing warms my heart more than an old couple walking hand in hand.
Tom ran on all foots.
Yeah, well, somehow I get a little sick watching the sun go down.
Be careful driving.
I'm terribly sorry.
Cool!
Why are you so tired?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I borrow your car?
Generally speaking, boys run faster than girls.
Go see what happened.
You're a real piece of shit!
We're a family of four.
I've come to the conclusion lately that 24 hours is not enough for one day.
We need to investigate this beforehand.
He admitted his mistakes.
What do you think would happen if the Earth stopped spinning?
You play the violin?
Life is a series of encounters and differences.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I guess I'll just do my homework or something.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Mari is utterly unwise in what she should say to him.
Do you think we should stop today?
I'm writing a diary in French.
Tom's hands are small.
Tom made his choice.
I borrowed money from my friend.
It's a pig's day.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
You made the right decision.
I felt a faint tremor, but it wasn't an earthquake. It was just a truck driving past.
Can you help me move this table?
I can't live like that.
I'm going in.
I'm glad I was able to meet you.
Seems interesting!
Move on, please.
I love Australia.
Tom chased Mary.
He's an ugly man.
Whose hatred is that?
Are you all right?
Can you please move on?
He's a little naive.
Easy trick!
Let's keep moving.
Tom got off a horse saddle.
The truth is, I don't know anything about it.
I can't see Tom.
But I didn't cry today!
The puppies got caught next to their mother.
I wish I'd taken more pictures.
I have a headache.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's gaining weight.
He was carrying the baby on his back.
I just went to the barbershop.
How much should I pay?
Don't worry about it.
The more cooks, the worse the soup.
When I returned the next day, there was a new waitress.
Let me help you.
I hit Tom.
Take some fruit, please.
He's got a lot of money.
Obviously, Tom is just pretending to be asleep.
The detective questioned literally thousands of people about the case.

You should rewrite this sentence.
We have to go now.
They all know I'm not a Muslim.
I'm glad to be friends with Tom.
I'm taking you home.
I don't think it's weird at all.
Tom never thought he could do what he just did.
I don't understand abstract paintings at all.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Who else am I supposed to believe?
Tom couldn't find the right words.
Who are you waiting for?
Never seen a whale this big.
Can I have salt, please?
Tom lived to be 97 years old.
I'm glad you liked it.
Can you ski tonight?
Tom lost the trust of others.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
Come back soon.
Don't sweat it.
If you're going out, close the door.
When you're tired, sleep is the best medicine.
I'd like to go to France sometime.
Can you drive me to the station?
I want to love someone.

Do you want a drink?
I need you.
He was too old to resist.
Can you give me a book?
I have a red bicycle.
Get up!
My husband reads the paper while he eats breakfast.
I wish you were never born.
Make sure it doesn't happen again.
Listen to the radio.
Don't move!
I need soap.
Call me at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
I know you do.
200 houses were completely destroyed in the fire yesterday.
Don't forget to pack your cigarettes.
PDF, you know what that means?
He was worried about the waiting room.
He opened the door.
You look good with short hair.
That's good.
Have you booked a hotel yet?Sorry, not yet.
Can you tell me why you love her?
I'm not drinking alcohol.
Tom cleaned his glasses.
Generally speaking, boys run faster than girls.
I've never eaten a mango before.
This place is a hospital.
I don't understand how that happened.
Can you tell me why you love her?
He's honest in everything.
He tried his best, but he lost.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
How old was Tom when he lived in Australia?
I hope your wish comes true.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, what's going on?
Absolutely!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I can't find the right words to express this feeling.
Don't worry about it.
I think you're lying.
Let's learn English.
The moon has risen.
A moment.
I have to know by tomorrow.
Are you a slave to your slaves?
Tom won't talk.
If we're being honest, I don't know anything about it.
It's already 10:00, and I'm sure your mother's angry.
Tom wasn't rich.
It's two miles from here.
I don't like studying in this heat.
I met a man, and then he told me the way.
Too late.
They congratulated her on her marriage.
Let's take a picture here.
I disagree.
Don't brag about it.
I'm doing the best I can.
Tom wondered how many times Mary was arrested.
The person you see over there is my uncle.
Tom is dead.
I'm giving you a bicycle as a birthday present.
I'm sorry about last night.
I'm coming back to Japan in a few years.
What a lucky thing!
Do you have a card?
They were cleaning the road.
Can I come back?
Tell Tom that won't happen.
Never heard of anything so strange.
That's my CD.
Our cat died yesterday.
Get up!
The young engineer had little experience.
Is this some kind of joke?
He has a loud voice.
Tom's greatest fear was that he would never walk again.
Tom didn't bring it.
I'm a little hungry.
Who were you talking to?
He can swim really fast.
He's strict, but understanding.
I love you!
Pay the room price in advance.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom knows everything about cars.
Oh, my God!
He was late for school.
Can you tell me how to get to Kyoto Station?
What do you want for breakfast?
What do you want most of all now?Money.
Roman history is very interesting.
He grew up to be a doctor.
Hey, you guys want to order pizza?
I can't find it in my gloves.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the station?
Can I get another cup of tea?
He's pennyless.
Trees are floating.
Somewhere it's 5:00.

What's your job?
I wish summer could come soon.
I'm going to watch TV tonight.
The date of return of the report is approaching, so I am in a complete unimaginable hurry.
I'm glad you found your girlfriend.
Tom fell ill because he was overdoing it.
Coffee, please.
Relax!
Christmas is coming, isn't it?
Where did you go?
He ran as fast as he could.
Tom is a photographer.
Do you want a drink?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Japan is a beautiful country.
We are men.
Today is Monday.
I'm almost finished.
Bank opens at nine.
Do you know how old Mr. Nakano is?
I don't understand what he's thinking.
Can you take your hat off?
What's so interesting about baseball?
I think you'd better start a diet.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Excuse me, could you take me to the train station?
Tom nodded.
If you wanna ask me anything, just point.
I wish we could have a weekend soon.
Who is this man?
Can you talk a little slower?
The phone broke down during the call.
Can I get a share?
How long have you been looking for it?
I don't have any children.
When he meets me on the street, he always stays to chat.
When you get to Osha, contact me.
Are these Tom's shoes?
I don't understand German at all.
The truth is, I don't know anything about it.
Have a great weekend.
I love this picture.
I was speechless.
Seems like today isn't my lucky day.
I was in the mountains.
I think he's a very good teacher.
Can you turn it down?
You've seen some movies lately?
Tom wears a blue sweater all the time.
I'll take the yellow.
I was just writing a letter when he came home.
Can I get you a drink?
Can I borrow your car?
Where are they from?
Tom went into the car.
We're good friends now, but we didn't like each other at first.
I'm so tired, I could die.
I'm in a lot of pain right here.
Can you pass me some sugar?
Have you eaten Japanese food?
I ate dinner late last night.
I study English every day.
This is your family?
He didn't come to the meeting last time.
The flood was the worst disaster they'd ever encountered.
Excuse me, can you give me some advice on how to get to the post office?
Papa often goes to America for business.
It is a great honor to have the King visit our city.
Jesus Christ!
I'm totally broke.
Why did he quit his job?
I saw a plane.
"We're a little early.""""Let's go waste some time at some coffee shop.
Get in there!
Give up!
Tom is a man you can trust.
I just like the smell of bread made from the oven.
I have to go.
Tom ate his stomach full.
Make a reservation as soon as possible.
Can you get the person responsible?
I'm throwing up.
Are you really gonna eat that whole thing?
Don't run away!
I'm gonna have a cold drink.
Forget what we talked about.
Wait a minute.
I got a letter from my friend.
What do you think is a good birthday present for Tom?
How much is it?
We still believe his innocence to be true.
Forget what we talked about.
Let's just stop for the day.
Make yourselves comfortable.
This is his house.
I'd like to perform at Carnegie Hall sometime.
I have to know by tomorrow.
It's already 11:00.
This is your first time in this town?
What time did you go to bed last night?
Tom has a Swiss bank account.
You're not going to die!
I don't think we're in the mood to go to the movies.
Come here.
The doctor wanted him to stop drinking.
Come with us.
I agree with Tom.
I like English, but I don't speak it very well.
I don't care, please.
I'm not tired at all.
I can't stand this pain.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom frowned.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You wouldn't talk like that.
I'm calling from my cell phone.
It's too expensive!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The hunter shot the bear.

Can I have a toothbrush?
I noticed him as soon as he got off the bus.
What does that mean?
Tom has glasses with jealousy.
Make yourselves at home.
I have to go now.
That's too much!
Bob was doing the laundry.
Ken is a good swimmer.
You're not gonna tell anyone about this, are you?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thank you very much.
I can't live on 150,000 yen a month.
The train Tom was on was struck by lightning.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is a professional dancer.
To our knowledge, he is guilty.
There's no dog bigger than this.
I'm totally open.
I'll help you.
What is this?
English isn't easy, but it's interesting.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm having a pain in my eyes.
It's really hot today.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

See you later!
What are you talking about?
Wait, please.
Nobody believes he's innocent.
I like him because he's an honest person.
You'll write me.
That's really weird.
Tom had another foot in the grave.
If you have mental health issues or something, or how long you're gonna be following me around, you're a grownup, you're a little more independent.
Never saw him in his pants.

I still need to get the camera fixed.
Tom arrives in Boston at what time?
Always remember to bring an umbrella.
Can I eat this apple?
Don't mind, because this doesn't count.
I'm a rat.
He's telling lies.
I don't understand how that happened.
Tom's house was struck by lightning.
I can hear you twisting your throat.
You shouldn't be climbing mountains in such bad weather.
There's an exhibition of ancient weapons in the museum.
Have you asked Tom?
Have you got something to do on Saturday?
How about a night?
He gave me a long letter.
Of my friends, the most fascinating is Jenna.
I wanna go abroad.
Cow is a sacred animal for Hindus.
He's got a lot of money.
He's a detective.
I trusted him to help me.
Someone went to eat all my rental cakes.
Can I come out?
Can you show me something else?
I wish you a speedy recovery.
Tom has narrow shoulders.
I don't think that country needs any help.
You feeling bad?
Tom wants to learn to ride a bicycle.
Who baked this cake?
You got headphones?
It's two miles from here.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I keep a diary every day.
Tom called Mary this morning.
The previous host always smiled, but the new one seems to be a very shy person.
He told her he loved her.
A dog's turkey is, so to speak, its pimples.
There's a restaurant upstairs.
I wish I hadn't married.
There are many books in the library.
That sounds really tempting.
I have to go now.
I think the book is in the library.
I'm free.
I don't have a computer at home.
Tom rides his bike to school.
Without your help, I couldn't have done it.
I write my mother once a month.
It's really cold today, aren't you?
Tom likes to drink?
Can I have a pillow and a nap?
We hang out together all the time.
I don't have any money, but I have dreams.
I can't take this anymore.
Tom is a handsome man.
That's enough!
How much is this?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'll make you an offer.
Tom took a lot of pictures in Boston.
Can I try this on?
Tom is a good writer.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Where's my car?
Place of your seat!
What's the plan for the day?
I couldn't help but laugh.
Tom's looks bad.
I'm really sorry.
The man I met yesterday was Mr. Hill.
I've had enough of the last time!
Tom called?
When are you leaving?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I have a cat and a dog.
Can you play anything but the piano?
How long is this?
I hope so too.
You keep this a secret.
I'll be right there.
He heard the news and went around.
pronounce How is pronounce pronounced?
Although he promised to pay me this week, he never did.
Heat it up.
I'm pissing because you cooked.
I need some help.
You're not?
What's your address, anyway?
What do you do when you're on vacation?
There was once a great king who lived in Greece.
The plane couldn't take off because of the storm.
What time is dinner?
I did it!
If I'm honest, I didn't go there.
Tom barely looked at the report he got from Mary.
Mr. Whitel seems to have many friends.


That's enough!
Today is Thursday.
My big brother lives in Boston.
Can I come back tomorrow?
What are the differences between religion and philosophy?
Tom confessed his defeat.
I don't care what you say.
Have you paid the rent?
Do you like black cats?
He makes his living playing the violin.
I hope your wish comes true.
What are you laughing at?
Smile on your lips!
Can you close the door, please?
Can you double the bill?
Tom put salt in the eggs.
What did you have for breakfast?
Come to our village.
Tom never seems to be angry at anything Mary does.
It was fun.
Where are you going?
You're just looking for someone else's flaws.
Didn't anyone else go?
There are seedless grapes and seedless watermelons, but are there seedless mangoes?
Don't move until I tell you.
What are you doing?
I'm already in a rut.
You're saying Tom is a liar?
He's in a really bad mood today.
Can I have a bill?
My mother barely speaks English.
I get along very well with my aunt.
Translation is useful in helping us to get to know our mother tongue better.
I really appreciate people who are honest about their opinions.
Tom burned the letter.
Tom has no ability to concentrate.
Tom doesn't understand what it's like to be in love.
Tom complained about his witch wound.
That sounds good.
Tom won't say!
We like to talk.
Pintoa!
Can I hold your hand?
That movie sucks!
Do we sell weddings in that store?
Excuse me, but can I borrow your phone?
I'm not really going to pay $10
I'm in a hurry right now.
Tom bought a new house.
Don't judge people by their names.
Tom is stronger than the rest of us.
Let me introduce myself.
Is there anything you wanna do when you grow up?
What the hell are you doing?
Tom was in a car accident.
Can you rest?
Can you get me this rare book?

I don't know when my mother's coming back.
Stop talking now.
I'm so glad we could meet at the mill.
He's crazy about baseball.
I love you.
I've never seen a match like this.
Get the fuck out!
Show me the picture.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It was a fun dinner tour, notwithstanding the weather.
The police wanted to avoid bloodshed.
I hope I never see him again.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm all right. I'm all right.
What do you do with your free time?
It's better to starve than to steal.
I'm sorry to interrupt your call.
Listen to me very carefully.
I am as if this never happened.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom pointed towards the mountain.
That's a good idea!
After you.
Don't worry about it.
This week has been a terrible one, and my train has been late for two days in a row.
Papa's in the bath.
I'm from Australia.
Call me tomorrow at 9:00.
Leave your report by the end of the month.
What do you mean, what do you mean?
This is your book.
Helen is the best in her class.
Tom avoided Mary.
Second thing, do you play the violin?
Why me?
What are you trying to say?
Have you got hearing aids?
On a clear day you can see Mount Fuji in the distance.
They're a wealthy family.
I don't want to get married, but I want a baby.
I love you, Tom!
Tom frequentes Boston.
Need some help?
That's a good idea.
Who gave you this?
No more!
He cooked the eggs.
They carried water in the sango.
Can you keep a secret?
Tom is snoring with food.
I thought Tom and Mary were holding me hostage.
Have you got something to do tonight?
He speaks fast.
Why are you so surprised?
Can I have a map?
Excuse me, I'm asking too much.
Anyone can do that.
Can I get you a drink?
Never eat breakfast.
I'm a lesbian.
He's really tall, so I recognized him right away.
This is not the entrance.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The most interesting friend I have is Jenna.
Can you drive?
I turned 30 last week.
I saw him running.
He's really smart, isn't he?
Can I go to the bathroom? Sure.
That's really weird.

Iron is the most useful metal of all.
Tom was in Boston when he didn't have a chance to meet Maria.
I don't understand German at all.
I'm off on Sunday.
I'm not washing my hair in the morning.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
I walk every day except on rainy days.
Excuse me, but can I use your phone?
He returned home for the first time in five years.
Can you help me carry this?
Get a seat, please.
Knowing and teaching are totally different things.
When are you coming home?
He's probably going to fail.
I'm getting late, so I'm gonna have to go little by little.
Can you tell me how to get to the train station?
I'm leaving now.
This is not my ticket.
I want to quit school.
I'm dying of hunger!
Then I don't understand German at all.
You should go to bed if you're tired.
So this is it?
Tom is a cock.
Can you put a link to your pages for our company pages?
Tom didn't want to be a distraction to Mary when Mary was studying.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That sounds good.
I didn't know there was a light in a place like this.
Never seen him in a pair of jeans.
What did Tom do?
I've noticed the things you've said, but I can't agree with them.
I'm against it.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The CEO is a foot-on-the-ground type.
Where's the paper?
I'm fine with it.
Where are you going?
I have to know by tomorrow.
Tom can.
I have a lot of homework to do.
Can you help me?
Excuse me, but can I use your phone?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the station?
You mean it?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is crying too.
If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
How's your family?
Can you borrow a pencil?
The boy came back to life.
Tom can be trusted.
I'm just watching.
You should have kept your mouth shut.
I was surprised.
It's my thing.
What's in the cupboard?
He's really pissed off.
He was standing in the middle of the boys.
He made paper into a snowflake.
Be polite, please.
I prayed for you.
How did you hear that?
I refused first.
Don't worry about it.
I'm going to be late.
He says it's gonna be wildly hot from Friday.
Tom has a lot of money, but that doesn't mean he's happier.
Kiova is the capital of Ukraine.
Can I have a city guide, please?
If you knew how often Tom would leave his homework unfinished, you would be surprised.
Nobody knows why.
I really appreciate your kindness.
What happened?
It's shockingly cold today.
Tom was my friend.
What is this?
Tom is the same age as Mary.
Earthquakes and floods are natural disasters.
I'm tall.
Tom is not ill.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
Get in the house!
I might have to do a part-time job.
He looks old for his age.
He'll take care of you from now on.
I have to go now.
I understand you to a certain extent.
I'm in a hurry.
Tom asked for a way.
I'm sorry about the last couple of days.
How was the test?
He's going to be Nelson tonight.
Tom is interested in many things.
Nobody believes he's innocent.
But nobody can help me.
I have a difference of opinion with you.
We have nothing in common.
I'm a sweet person.
Can I have the bill, please?
All the papers were writing about what happened.
Nobody got up.
Get closer and take a closer look at the picture.
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry I was late.
I'm a little bit of a rascal.
What do you do when you have time?
Tom closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
I was surprised to hear this.
The moon and stars shone high above us.
I'm a twin.
I couldn't go outside because of the snow.
You should listen to his advice.
Roses in my garden are beautiful.

You're not forgetting your umbrella.
I will never forget your kindness.
Even at 50, she's still breathtakingly beautiful.
I lived in a nice hotel.
Can you close that window?
Sami is two years younger than Tom.

Tell Tom that I'm sorry.
We saw everything.
Tom is writing Mary a letter.
It's cold outside.
Mix it up.
I'm hoping we can make it today with some bread or something.
Tom decided to take matters into his own hands.
I don't remember.
Miss Smith is an English teacher?
I saw Tom tonight.
What else does Tom want?
You don't have to understand everything right now.
Can I have a glass of water, please?
I almost died a year and a half ago.
You'll have to attach your own photo to the application form.

This way!
Can I get you a coffee?
He's a good swimmer.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
Tom uses public transport.
Where did you buy your golf ball?
Tom is already asleep.
Tom talks to me every day.

What kind of eggs do you want?
You should talk to someone.
Jim looked to the right and left before crossing the road.
Excuse me, did I wake you?
Cold.
Tom was forced to flee.
I'd rather walk than take a bus.

How much beer was that?
He sleeps with two pillows.

That's the dumbest thing I've ever said.
Be a good girl and do your best, I beg you.
Tom said nothing.
I've had enough!
I don't think it's that weird.
You're not cold in the short?

I win with the stick, you lose with the crown.
Wildcats live in the woods.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the station?
If he died now, things would get terrible.
Tom quit smoking.
Where are you going?
A week later, she got a hard drive.
Get Tom up.
I started to understand why he hates me.
How was your weekend?
Can you translate this sentence for me?
He never got the world's attention.
Tom looked at the photo.
I can buy a car with this money.
I need a knife.
Can you open your purse?

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm full of jokes like this.
I couldn't help but laugh.
Tom is a perfectionist.


How's life in Germany?
Can you clean the table?
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
Relax!
Tom still can't write.
Tom dropped out of high school.
He filed a lawsuit.
Yooko was completely indifferent to Joni and Joni left her completely ignored.
It rains so bad and I'm so sick, so why don't you come and pick me up?
What does that mean?
The guy's pretending to know.
The toy is made of wood.
Can you write it down for me?
They're all looking for a missing child.
He may have gotten lost on the way.
It's on the eighth floor.

I don't understand why the meeting was postponed.
I walk in the woods every day.
My son can't count yet.
He put a sign on the billboard at the diner.
Don't worry about it.
Is there a place you wanna go?
The flower can do it.
Steal the money.
I'm glad to see you again.
I'm not gonna pay you $10.

He disappeared in the crowd.
I hope to become a singer.

Dick comes to school late sometimes.
I thought you were totally open.
Don't blame me for this.
Can I ask you to close one thing?Depends.
We eat together often.
I want to quit school.
All the seats are sold out.
Unfortunately, I never got a chance to see that castle.
I saw Tom crossing the road.
He quit drinking and smoking.

Tom is probably waiting.
I'm getting hurt all over the place.
You all right?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Who is this gentleman with the glasses?
Tom left.
Do you want some milk?
I always get up at 6:00.
Close the window so you don't get the flu.
What do you think?
I'll bring my sister with me next time.
If you make clothes with your own hands, you'll save money.

The author's name is well known.
I'm sorry I'm late for this.
Our company needs someone who is very knowledgeable about the latest technology.
Wait a minute.
I will never forget your kindness.
I think you should watch your meals.
Smoking makes your lungs mess up.
You gonna work till 10:00, huh?
I'll bet you're wrong.
Why is Tom here?

I'm not good at swimming.
What's inside?
Tom was silent.

Tell your friends hello.
Driving is a lot of fun.
He seemed to hold back from crying.
Well, what's my fault?
The more rushed the more delayed is a paradox.
Tom is the perfect boy.
Work has become increasingly difficult.
I have to go now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I kept reading.
Tom was wounded.
Why am I so tired?
Never too late to learn.
I saw a woman and two dogs in the car.
I don't know either of them.
The more stubborn, the more lonely.
We plan to travel abroad this summer.
He'll get out of bed and on his feet this afternoon.
Take it easy now.
Tom ate as much as he could.
They thought it was hard to make a living.
Have you got a customer card?
Have you ever been to Boston?
Make yourselves at home.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the beach?
He's trying to do it.
I was speechless.
Why do you think that?
I have an English test this afternoon.
You've got some cotton on your face.
How was the weekend?
I came here on business.
He used to live hand to mouth.
You must be an idiot!
I'm going to be late.
I'd like some help.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
What are you doing?
Let's have dinner.
Where did you get those shoes?

He hates fish and never eats it.
I want a reason to be light today.
I'm being straight.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I have a map of the city, please?
You'll need at least half an hour to walk from here to town.
He got a lot of money.

You still haven't had lunch?
It was cold.
I'm asking you to return to your seats.
There's not much difference between the two.
I ate dinner late last night.
Although Tom is ill, he plans to finish his homework on time.
Tom asked a stupid question.
Tom ate his word.
Wait a minute.
I need a knife.
Get your head in the ground!
I'm on the phone right now.
The attacker scored.
I want to die.
Tom wants to sit by the window.

Is that true?
Tom is smart.
You are so disgusting!
My father will be fine soon.
You had plenty of time.
Can I turn off the lights?
Have you ever had food poisoning?
He's not much of a beggar.
I'm in a hurry.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
How much is this camera?
This is the best way.
He can swim with his back.
This has nothing to do with you.
He's got a hole in him.
He came here again.
He stole the money from my safe.
Mari is the best singer in her class.
Stop it!
Susan made clothes for Jill.
He looked at me with all his attraction.
This is so sad!
Ottex, are you guys gonna be a cop?
Yooko is the captain of the football team.
Dinner is bad for your health.
Bob is very shy and when he talks to girls, he always turns red.

Can you wake me up tomorrow morning?
What are you writing?
What's the minimum wage in Australia?
Mama, I'm hungry. I need to go.
There was once a cruel king.
Tom is rich, but he's not happy.
That's a good idea!
It was handmade.
I don't like to study.
Money is more valuable than anything else in this world.
A minute.
How many days does it take?
I want a partner.

I have to know by tomorrow.
You've been studying ballet since you were three and I want to be a ballerina.
Where would you like to go?
Tom washed his car in Mary.
I hate karaoke.
We have to get on the road now.
I'm running out of money.
I wish I could find a way to get Tom to agree to stay.
Tom is a ronkle eater.
We're like this never happened.
Wi-Fi in French?
I wanted to help, but I couldn't do anything alone.
I don't wanna go to school today.
We leave Japan tomorrow morning.
Tom is inside the house.
Please sit down.
You're going to stop!
Tom raised the mustache.
Tom has low blood pressure.
How long can I borrow this?
What's your favorite?
Don't just stand there, say something!
What is this place?
I have high blood pressure.
What have you been doing?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
How are you?
Tom shouted as loud as he could.
Tom fell down the stairs.
Where do we meet tomorrow?
I booked an izakayá near Shinjuku Station, where drink-nin-nin-nin-kun-wolas cost 2,500 yen for two hours.
My father keeps telling his bad jokes like Did you go to the Thief's Invasion?
I'll come with you, if you don't mind.
I know how to count.
I was so sick I couldn't stand.

Tom was exhausted.
Tom started talking to Mary.
Tom has a donor card in his wallet.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I can't get any further.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
English isn't easy, but it's interesting.
I have a lot of compulsory work to do this afternoon.
Is that true?
He was looking at the letter he was getting from the boy.
I'm giving up.
What's the situation?
A liar.
Should you bow now?
He's a nice guy.

Wake me up at 8:00.
Who is Tom's girlfriend?
I got a weird e-mail.
Don't tell Tom, because I don't want to worry him.
Now that my older brother is a university student, he has to read a lot of books.
I don't like to study.
Have you eaten yet? Yes, I have.
Don't laugh at me!
Tom read that book all over one night.
You're short of guts!

Can't say if I don't feel sorry for you, but I can't help you.
Handwashing!
Thank you!
Thank you for inviting me.
The train is late for snow.
Behave like a man.
I don't want to eat anything.
I'm on my way.
Can you tell me what time the train leaves?
What's the next thing to do?
They adopted the little girl.
I'm not tired at all.
Have you got a driver's license?
I think if you had a little more guts, you'd have succeeded.
Tom and I talked about that three weeks ago.
Move on, please.
Have you got a bite?
Is it my fault?
Ask Tom what he thinks of Boston.
Compared to the old days, the buildings have become much more prisoners.
I have pain in my legs.

By the way, the university graduation ceremony is next week.
Make it sound like we never talked about it before.
You ever heard of the Loch Ness monster?
You found your umbrella that you said you lost the other day?
I have to go now.
Have you got a jar?
I didn't hear you coming in.
Have you ever smoked cigarettes?
It's a little cold today.
I couldn't see anything.
He took something out of his pocket.
I'm easily influenced.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Read this by next week.
A book is one that makes you want to read it again.

If he's late, can you give him this message?
Make yourselves comfortable.
So much for black.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Something has happened to Tom.
I wanted to name my daughter Mari.
He was nervous in front of his eyes.
Tom has never seen a UFO.
I wish I had a car.
I just had sushi and beer.
How could I believe you?
Stop adding sentences to Tatoeba! You're addicted to this.
Tom was stuck in the mud.
What made him so angry?
I have gifts.
Tom sat on the couch.
Have a good trip!
I don't speak French at all.
Don't be late!
I'm taking the eleven train.
He turned towards the tall woman standing next to him.
Just kidding.
You and he are so nice.
What do you do with your free time?
I got there safely this morning.
I'm doing great.
What's the matter?
Tom, can you come tomorrow?
Why don't you eat vegetables?
You have a lovely necklace.
Can I drink this whole thing?
What did you get?
You got a long way to go to school?
How old is your uncle?
I'm a little bit of a rascal.
Tom wants to play.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What are you eating?
He's a good man.
Where are you hurting?
I'd like some coffee.
How do you get to school?
You should pay more attention to your own safety.
Tom got me.
Let's be friends for ever.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom can swim well.
He thought about how fast time goes.
What's your favorite color?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom made his choice.
The pandas live in the bamboo forest.
Where does this Tom guy live?
I don't understand how you can eat something like that.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Where are you going?
Can I leave school early today?
I can't find words to express this idea.
Peace negotiations start this week.
Tom watches TV.
Can you stop answering my questions by questions?
I have to go.
He rarely went there.
Tom fell asleep.
He cut off all ties to the company he'd worked for 18 years.
You're the bridge. You're not broken. You should go to bed.
A little clever!
Tom is kidding.
When Mary knocked on the door, Tom was just about to leave.
Don't go anywhere from here.
He's got a can.
Ask me something easier.
You hungry?

Can you drop me off at the station?
He's a purple.
I'm sorry if I offended you.
Do you still love your wife?
This is the worst movie ever made.
What is that?
I'm working out.
House broke down within a week.
You in a lot of pain?
He didn't come to the meeting the last time.
Let's get in touch.
Ken wants a bicycle.
It was really cheap.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.
What are you all talking about?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm jealous of Tom.
How much is this umbrella?
What is this?
We couldn't go fishing because of the heavy rain.
I was having lunch.
I'm not as good at tennis as Tom.
Did you hear Tom quit?
We have to go.
It's been a long week.
Don't you trust Tom?
Who is it?
He's smart.
Happy New Year!

I'm supposed to have a meeting next Thursday.
Thank you for coming.

I'm already full.
I watched TV and accidentally fell asleep.
Have you finished reading the book?
I like coffee more.
I'm off on Sunday.
Tom checked his watch.
Can I tell Tom?
This soup is a terrible fire.
I almost got hit by a car.
Can you advise me to the station?
I'm not sure.
Joni is clever.
He's a doctor.
No talking about work.
I saw him in the photo, so I recognized him right away.
You ready?
Let's just leave things as they were until he comes back.
What time do you usually go to bed?
Do you want a drink?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can you drive me to the station?
Enter in the upper right corner of the screen.
Tom couldn't love himself anymore.
The two children were the same age.

Now is a good time to reflect on your own past.
This movie is so bad.
I thought I'd try some Mexican food tonight.
Wish me luck.
Don't you love me anymore?
Tom would.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Tom can come anytime.
What kitchen?
It was just a joke.
Can I ask you one question?
He told his little brother about it.
I'm coming the same way as you.
How do you want the steak?
How was your day today?
I'm sorry, I forgot about that.
Mama bought my little brother a yellow umbrella.
Can I join you?
He's very much into television.
Do you want a drink?
Tom is really nice.
The fire last night burned 200 houses.

Tom's bike was stolen.
Stay a while longer.
What happened to him?
The roads run the same way.
Let's take the bus.
Looks like it's going to rain.
Don't worry about it!
He is what he is today, thanks to sports.
You can't blame him for the accident.
You should go.
Maybe tomorrow it will rain.
Who is that old lady?
Use a lead.
You're sparing water.
Are you afraid of me?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Tom can run fast.
Tom lost his job.
Don't worry about it.
Make yourself comfortable.
How's your big sister?
He couldn't make it on time because of the storm.
We've only known each other for a while.
Let's go somewhere warm.
Full of water?
Eye red from crying.
We have to leave now.
I keep a diary every day.
Why can't I?
Acid is not a natural phenomenon.
They demanded a raise.
Thank you for your kindness.
He didn't come to this last meeting.
He returned home from Europe in 1941, the year the war began.
Tom hurt his back.
The doctor told me to wear eye drops three times a day.
I have no choice.
You eat ice cream?
Get the hat off!
I spend at least three hours a week learning French.
Keep the change.
He seems like a student.
If you're just doing it on purpose, I don't want you to come.
Stop playing!
I'm already full.
No rule without exception.
Ninni and Jaana were both out of school.
This clock is accurate.
I have to go now.
A happy start to the year!
Tom lit a fire.
I want to be a part of it.
You think this is just between us.
I'm 19 years old.
I can walk.
Promise must be kept.

I'm learning ten new words every day.
He won that competition easily.
I'm really sorry.
I have to know by tomorrow.
Jane likes dogs more than cats.
Excuse me, but is there an Otto-automatic nearby?
Make yourselves at home.
I need to buy a new rug for this room.
I'm the first.
Follow me.
I'm going to be late.
What are you looking for?
You're good with black.
I may be a few minutes late.
When is the ship coming?
You want some ice cream?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom made a terrible noise.
I wish it was a weekend.
I was having lunch.

Tom has a bad way of drawing hasty conclusions.
I like fish and fish.
I need to buy a new rug for this room.
We did it!
Can you help me with my stray?
Let me see.

I was a monk all day.
Tell your friends hello.
Japan
You're going to regret it!
Can I pay you, please?
I'm from Australia.
He's busy writing a letter.
Can I hold your hand?
I have to go now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Get out of here!
When she heard the news, she cried out of happiness.
Keeping a diary helps us remember the little things of everyday life.
Where are you going?
Even three contestants fell during the race.
Can I have some milk, please?
Can you spare me a second?
You wasted time.
On a beautiful day from Helsinki you can see the coast of Estonia.
Yeah, I've only slept outside lately, so I've been able to relax properly for a long time.
Tom put sunglasses on his head.
"How was the test?""It wasn't as difficult as I imagined".
Do you want to have a drink?
I couldn't come to school because of my illness.
I'll help you.
Can you tell me your address?
Why?
There's not much difference between the two.
I want you to behave when we're at the dining table.
Tom has difficulty deciding what to wear to a party.
Are you ready?
What are you doing on New Year's Day?
Which one do you think is right?
I wish we could have curry for dinner tonight.
So what's the test?
A great idea!
Excuse me, but can you answer the phone?
I'm the fastest runner.
Tell me what?
I wanna go abroad.
Mike, on the phone.
I have a back problem.
What's the kitchen?
Yes, it is.
Can you please move on?
I'm sorry you had to wait.
Speak loud and clear.

My brother is in Australia now.
When I watch TV, I fall asleep.
Let me in.

Tom didn't know what to say.
Please go first!
I agree.
I have five sons, two of them are engineers, one is a teacher, and the rest are students.
He's decided to leave a notice of separation.
English isn't easy, but it's interesting.
Since when have you been looking for it?
Do you know where Tom is hiding?
Tom cannot explain the difference between high-quality and low-quality wine.
Excuse me, can I have a spoon?
Whatever way you go, you'll get to the station.
How far is it from here to there?
It has nothing to do with him.
I'm getting hurt all over the place.
Marie is so sexy.
He's deciding on new guidelines.
Mik and Tom are in the same class.
You live in Turkey?
I have no idea what it's like.
This is a tree house.
This has nothing to do with me.
That's not fair.
Near the park, there was a coffee shop.
The owner turned the prince into a cat.
Why do I have to do that?
Tom ordered a beer.
Tom doesn't know what's really going on.
I don't have a pencil.
If I'm honest, I didn't go there.
Tom, where are you?
Can I use this pencil?
I wanna watch TV.

He wanted to see the bullfight, but his father wouldn't let him see it in any name.
Tom is a high school student.
I'd like to do something, but what was it?
I was sure he'd help me.
He couldn't have said that.
You'll know it soon enough.
The man standing there is the owner of the store.
He gave each child two apples.
I'm already full.

Tom's face is red.
It's good weather.
Your advice always helps me.
I'm free.
Japan did not treat even white people who spoke fluent Japanese as Japanese.
Write your address on this.
I support this plan.
Long time!
Do you know Tom's real name?
He's a good man.
Can you lend me some money?
This conversation is over now.
He's a good man.
This is none of your business.
I want to quit school.
Tom has a sports car.
Get it together.
Fire!
I'm on my way.
Let's stop the debate.
Have you fulfilled your wish?
If you've already paid, leave this message unattended.
Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the bus stop?
What a beautiful flower!
Let's keep in touch!
Tom opened the door and walked into the office.
Both of these kids were the same age.
Don't let this chance go!
What are you cooking?
Tom is on the boat?
Have you fulfilled your wish?
Where can I call?
I can't speak French at all.
Have a nice trip!
I'm in a hurry.
I'll see you next week.
What do you think, Tom?
Let me die.
Have you had dinner yet?
I'm going outside.
Someone stole my passport.
Nothing was seen.
I don't need that.
Please forgive me.
My mother is a lawyer.
I'll meet you at 6:00 in the car.
Tom answered round.
Ten of the students were caught for prostitution.
Are you free this afternoon?
Get the fuck out!
Can you join us?
Why can't you see the bus?
Can you drive me to the station?
Eat too much is bad for your health.
He was lying on the couch with his eyes closed.
He left his home village behind and never returned.
You should be prepared for the worst.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
How old are you?Sixteen years.
That's my job.
What am I supposed to do in this room?
I'm out of soap.
I've had enough of the last time!
Can you wake me up at dawn?
He couldn't stop crying.
Don't tell anyone about this.
You play the violin?
I love her very much.
Where are you from?
I asked him why he was so sad.
Come here and join us.
I'm glad you found these clothes.
Do you know why Tom is out of school?
How busy I am.
Do you have a card?
I need a lead, can I borrow one of your nails?
Mari doesn't know what to say to her.
These are birds.
I don't know anything about it.
I was having lunch.
There's a red rose in the cup.
You don't have to worry about that kind of thing.
If you don't hurry, you'll miss the last train.
Let's try something!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm going to be late.
Ask Alex what he's up to.
I can't hear anything.
Our school is in this village.
The average Japanese rice consumption has been cut in half in 50 years.
Tom can do it.
I want you to return the book I lent you a while back.
Japan has left-hand traffic.
He was lucky to pass the exam.
I was playing when I felt the earthquake.
There's nothing to be proud of.
The two children were the same age.
I want to go abroad.
I'm already full.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He was looking through the letter from her.
I have to go to bed.
I'll be there in a minute.
I don't know what to say...
He closed the door tightly when he walked in.
How about tomorrow night?
I'm getting a cold.
Don't worry about it.
You should rewrite this sentence.
Get your head up!

Are we gonna be friends?
He's already here.
We climbed the top of Mount Fuji.
It was handmade.
Who painted this?
You should take this opportunity.
Something smells like fire.
I like it so much.
I'm totally broke.
You're making me so mad.
Which of the shirts do you like?
I have to go now.
Don't let a good chance go.
A blast of hunger!
Those are my books.
I wash my laundry on Sundays.
I'm so sorry about that.
It's already 7:00.
What are you having for lunch today?
Make yourself comfortable.
Tom closed the kitchen door.
I like reading thrillers.

Nothing unusual happened on our trip.
I don't think he can do that.
What kind of animal would you compare me to?
Get home quickly.
Olga has been playing cello since she was eight.

The sun is peeking out of the clouds.

Who is this filler?
Tom put a helmet on his head and sat on the back of his motorcycle.
Tom hurried into the room.
Tom turned on the lights.
Can you hold on a sec?
Get a seat, please.
Tom didn't even try to listen to his father.
He's not gonna give up a second, no matter what anyone says.
All the listeners were foreigners.
That black is mine.
Stop it!
️Every rule has its exceptions.
I've cried too much, my eyes and my head hurt.
He's a good football player.
Help me!
Now, I made a mistake, because if I hadn't opened this, it could have been sent back as a return item.
I'm getting late, so I'd better get going.
Can I pay you, please?
We should sit down.
I'm not washing my hair in the morning.
Tom sat on the couch.
I'm glad I was of help to you last week.
Nobody believes he's innocent.
Tom is quick to talk.
Do you understand me?
I'm Tom.
I realized he was angry the second I saw him.
Tom didn't tell me everything.
Tom drew his sword.
Then I went back to buy some unnecessary junk.
Are you still awake?
I can't do this anymore.
Knowing this song?
Next time, I'm gonna take my older sister with me.
Who is it?
Can I have the bill, please?
I promised you.
Tom didn't even look at the report he got from Mary.
He was only 20.
So did I.
I'm totally fucked up.
Need a ride?
Don't you have anything to say?
Tom saw something red there.
Kamele are often used for travel in the desert.
That's a good thing.
Temperature is 6°C on the side of the freezer.
This is totally incomprehensible.
Keep going.
It's just what you say.
If there were no air and no water, we wouldn't be able to live.
His uncle runs that hotel.
He has a great sense of humor.
You're gonna have a stomachache if you eat that much.
Who cares now?
Good night!
I can't sing as well as Mari.
Don't you have any heat?
We disagree at all.
Welcome to the house!
Make this right.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
Don't worry about it.
I'd bet the short will be unpleasantly cold.
I'm Japanese.
I'm in a hurry.
He's here.
There once was a beautiful princess.
This is disgusting!
Tom ought to apologize to Mary for not arriving on time.
What a wonderful idea!
I have a dictionary within reach.
I can see what he's trying to say.
I like the smell of fresh bread.
When your name is called, stand up.
I am so grateful for your kindness.
I'm having a blast.
Depends on the point of view.
Election Day was rainy and cold.
The report return date is approaching, so I'm in a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
What's the size of the enterprise?
What kind of songs do you sing in karaoke, Tom?
Can you hold on a second?
The baby has been crying for almost 10 minutes.
Oh, I have to return the books to the library.
I don't want to cause any more trouble.
How tragic!
I woke up at 6:00 every morning.
I heard the happy voices of the children.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom bought a gift for Mary.
Tom has a bad reputation.
When did you start learning French?
Now is a good time to reflect on your own past.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When the summer is over, I'm gonna have an exam.

They're a married couple.
Get on the pressure!
Oh, my God!
I'm not being fair.
What do you think, Tom?
What's the matter?
Joni is two years older than me.
Tom is my friend.
Tom became anorexic when he was in high school.
You want to go in?
You should have let it go!
Students should study hard but also find time for active social life.
It's all right.
He can ride.
Tom was the first to start talking to me when I had just changed school and I didn't have any friends.
Tom is just like his mother.
I have a lot of things to do this afternoon.
He has a lot of creative ideas.
When did you buy that cell phone?
I'd like a glass of wine.
What's in the desk box?
I'm speechless.
It would be so cool to speak ten different languages!
Show me someone who says they love you.
Hey, if you're not quick, the bank will close! Oh, yeah, I decided to go to the bank tomorrow.
I think that's a good idea.
I want to make ice cream.
It's important, so I'm taking it all on myself.
Are you ready?
When do we get there?
Don't try to do two things at once.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm coming right now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can you lend me 500 yen?
Are you Tom's daughter?
Yesterday night, my mom was up late.
Do you want a drink?
He'll help me without a doubt.
A long time ago!
I don't know either of them.
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?

The story he told us recently makes no sense.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Are you saying I'm wrong?
I'm mad at Tom.
The results were as follows:
This is Tom?
I wish summer could come soon.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You have to work harder.
Let's go!
Excuse me, I'd like to order.
Bill is two years older than me.
I found them all except one.
When I don't know exactly what this math task would solve...
So Tom isn't here yet?
The important thing is not to win the game, but to be a part of it.
How long can I borrow this book?
Tom checked the time.
I'm out of money.
I'm next door, so if you get a promise, just let me know.
Tom pulled out of his bag an MP3 player.
You must stop gambling.
This is the end of it.
Tom ran after Mary.
We won the battle.
You're so smart!
As long as I live, I'm sure I'll never forget the things you've done for me.
This is urgent.
Don't get involved in other people's business.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I went to the country early.
Who told you that?
How's the weather in Boston?
Seems like they're back together.
Eat these cookies if you're smart.
Don't throw pearls at pigs.
I'm a family of four.
He kept running for 30 minutes.
We've been in touch.
He's an old friend of mine.
Tom was abused by his father.
Have you ever eaten Japanese food?
Talk to Tom is scary.
Can you hold on a sec?
Take the hat off.
I don't want to go alone.
Tom loves Australia.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
A real zero.
Although I have a pee tomorrow, I went to drink a lot of orange juice.
How did you meet Tom?
Don't worry about it.
You are so beautiful!
There's still a long way to go.
I don't know.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I was depressed all day.
I want to see you again next week.
He likes French more than German.
How many students are there?
If we're gonna be honest, I don't know anything about it.
He tried to control his anger.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Tom's house has small windows.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
Can you close the door?
You lent me your dictionary?
I have some papers I need to write by tomorrow.
I'll be back by 6:30.
I've got a lot of work to do today.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Have you got plans for tomorrow?
How tall are you?
There is no atmosphere.
When did you find your watch missing?
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

It's over now, give me the ring back!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What did you come to Malaysia for?
I'm sorry about that.
All my clothes are ordered.
Just kidding.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Do you have a pen?
I bought it yesterday.
How many hours did you go to bed last night?
He's so lovely.
This movie is totally awful.
I have a lot of fever.
Seems like we've fallen asleep by accident too late.
All right, let's get this started.
Are you all right?
Beware of thieves in these parts.
I'm leaving on Sunday.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The puppies pressed tightly against their mother.
He looks old for his age.
Tom is my friend.
I have to get back to work.
That's funny.
This dress is packing on me.
Who gave you that?
Édith Piaf was a French singer.
Tom made a decision.
Leave it to me.
Can you spare me some time?
What's the matter with you?
I'm not tired at all.
Snow has been falling for days.
Let me help you.
We're on your guard.
I can skate.
Tom was shot twice in the chest.

Susan made Jill a suit.
I don't speak French at all.
I already ate lunch.
He said something that hurt Meg.
This is your translation, Tom?How is that?What does this modemism define?I don't know, but it was originally written that way.Is that right?No right, it's gone.Hey, wait, here's what it says modernism
He's old.
Nice to meet you.
Tom's mother was a devout Catholic.
Why are you so tired?
You in Boston?
I'm so upset that we ran ten laps around the school today at the school club.
Are you aware of the fact that you're not being talked about well?
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the airport?
Tom dyed his hair pale brown.

Get out of here!
How many Chinese friends do you have?
I'd like some coffee.
I have to go to bed.
Although she turned 50, she is still breathtakingly beautiful.
Watch where you're going.
They're baseball players.

How many flights a week do you have to New York?
Get some exercise outside.
What time do you think you'll be there?
Nobody knows the truth.
Write your address on this.
Tom found Mary lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
They had a wonderful time together.
Tom is snoring with food.
Hui, I'm scared, don't suddenly hear such loud noises.
Anyone can do that.
Tom is my little brother.
When I woke up, I realized it was a dream.
Tom watches TV.
When you have questions, ask the teacher.
I'd like some coffee.
The wind knocked down a tree.
Can I leave a message?
Oh, my God!
What would you do in a situation like this, Tom?
I'm hearing a bunch of chickens, and I wonder if the users don't notice.
Let's keep in touch.
$10 postal address, please.

There was a church here.
He's a DJ.
What did you buy for fireworks?
A friend of mine said he bought a new watch.
Are you all right?
Don't you worry, Tom?

He's a good guy now, so he's gonna be a good husband in the future.
Give me my money back!
When I woke up, I realized it was all a dream.
Tom is interested in mountaineering.
I missed you.
Thank you for calling.
Let me help you.
I'm sorry, I was just wondering.
I don't know how to say this word.

I couldn't go outside because of the rain.
I'm really sorry.
Can I sit here?
I'm ready for anything for you.
I told you.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the station?
Tom speaks French as well as Maria.
Stay where you are!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You are so beautiful.
That's nice to hear.
You pressed the button?
Have a nice vacation!
Keep in touch with me.

I want to eat delicious yakisobale.
I'm not gonna change my mind, no matter what you say.
Of course you are!
It's really hot today.
"Can I borrow this pen?" "Yes, please".
I'm about to have a baby.
I'm called Tom.
Can you give me a ride to the station?
I make a hundred euros a day.
This is a tough one.
This problem is a real challenge.
I'm so sorry about that!
Excuse me, but can you answer the phone?
Complaining doesn't help at all.
In the hands of a wise person, things become simple. The average person who pretends to be wise is the one who makes the easy thing sound difficult.
Years have passed, but can he remember my face?
Tom scored perfectly on the chemistry test.
I have a lot of things to do this afternoon.
You lied to me, didn't you?
I got up a minute ago.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The movie was much better than I expected.
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
We took out a loan with a high interest rate.
Can you hold on a second?
Be polite, please.
Pig is weird!
Congratulations to you!
The food was a big hit.
That photo is black and white.
I saw a dog.
Get down!
Is Mr. Smith an English teacher?
I'd like to go winter.
I think if you really want to improve your language skills, you might want to not just translate sentences or something, but make fun of it, and if that's fun, then maybe that's a good thing.
Can I ask you one question?
I was in Canada at the time.
When it comes to war, they're no match for any other hero.
I have to go now.
I have to take the camera for repairs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What kitchen?
Do you sell wedding rings?
What is this all about?
Bird sings.
How much is the entrance?
After dinner we sang, danced and chatted.
Wait a minute.
How do you get the lights out of here?
I'd like a piece of cake.
Well, if I don't stay in class, will you start hanging out with me?I don't like to hear any talk.
Which is best for you?
I'm not.
We're driving to the airport.
Thank you for your help.
We shouldn't have gotten up so early.
Tom speaks English with a French accent.
She's married to a foreigner.

Stop it!
What is it?
We waited a long time, but he never showed up.
You have a good musical personality.
I'll explain it in detail next week.
Why are you angry? I'm not angry!
Don't let your luck get away with it.
I'm pregnant with my baby.

I lost my camera the day before.
️Tennis is fun.
Hurry up, I think you'll make it to the train.
I don't want to watch TV tonight.
I trusted him to help me.
What else does Tom need?
Can you keep a secret?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He picked the best jewels in the store.
Nobody paid attention to her.
I'm in a hurry to get to the top.
Look at this!
There were plenty of places available the day I went there.
Come on, hurry up!
I like the music.

If you go to sleep in that suit, you'll be cold.
Hey you lady there.
Get him some beer.
You'd better get some sleep.
Eat the fruit you want.
I'm really happy.
When the phone rang, I was in the bathroom.
There were a lot of people in the park.
What is this?
Sometimes I take the bus, sometimes I take the car.
Are you in a lot of pain?
I saw Tom getting into Mary's car.
What do you recommend?
My daughter is sleeping bad.
This CD is hers.
He was scared and mute.
Get up!
It's really expensive!
I don't speak French at all.
Takeshi wishes he could go to London to study English.
How did he react to the bad news?
I can't get rid of my flu.
You're good at French.
Is it really necessary?
Is this really spaghetti?
This town is no longer in its former glory.
I never liked biology.
I walk to school in half an hour.
Don't mess with me!
"Are you tired of going to Akita?""
He seemed very tired.
Why is he here?
I can't help but think so.
I think he'll be here anyway.
He's telling lies.
Tom speaks English with a strong French accent.
He's kind by nature.
Can you let me go home?

Yuuko never spoke to a foreigner.
Can I have a bill, please?
Tom hasn't spoken to Mary in years.
How much money do you have with you?
Tom doesn't understand what Mary was trying to say.
Come and sit down, please.
They were going to drill for oil.
I don't want to go out tonight.
He's avoiding me.
I go to church every day.
I was sucking dust off the floor with a dustbreaker.
Mari doesn't know what to say to her.
I have a present.
Here's all the money I have.
Tom was single his whole life.
I'm sorry I'm late for this.
Tom is used to speaking in public.
I'm planning to spend my New Year's holiday in Australia.
He looked at her with a smile on his face.
Lori said we'd have a ten-minute coffee table.
He's a teacher.
I'm going to buy my son a watch.
Despite the tremor and the swing, I managed to get on the train for two hours.
Now's the best time to see the cherry blossoms.
He'll be here anyway.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Stop playing games.
I mean, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just saying,
You're lying.
Excuse me, could you hand me a little pepper?
He has no authority over his subordinates.
Can you show me something else?
The book is easy.
The CEO is a realistic type of person.
I guess you could say with certainty that he's the greatest pianist of the 20th century.
Of course I'm against war.
You talking to me?
Tom thinks Mary can't break the record.
I usually go for a walk.
Where did you get that book?
I'll be home all day tomorrow.
Hui, I'm scared, don't suddenly hear such loud noises.
I don't remember the man's name.
What would you like to drink?
Can I come to the car park?
Jump!

Who broke this?
I'm drunk. I know.
You're keeping this confidential.
Help me!
What is that?
Can you take your hat off?
I totally agree.

Turn right at the next intersection.
Make it clear.
The football player is a freak.
I'm totally open.
I'm starting to want to die.

Can you turn the radio down?
Don't laugh at me, I did too many stomach movements last night and my stomach is sore!
I'm here alone.
I'm already full.
I was up late last night.

What are you reading?
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Mama just went shopping.
I'm looking forward to it.
I want to do things that I might as well just leave out when I have a job to do.
Tennis is a lot of fun.
Can you pass me the salt?
Health above all.

That doesn't mean anyone could become a poet.
Tom lost his eyesight in a car accident.

What made him so angry?
Is it my fault?
You're serious?
If you have a fever, you'd better get to the hospital early.
What kind of person is Tom?
When I look at my daughter's peacefully sleeping face, I think,I'll do my best again tomorrow.
I'm sorry, but I think you're my place.
What do you do in your free time?
I like to eat seafood.
Always nice to meet you.
Marie has beautiful brown eyes.
I'm a little bit of a rascal.
Never met him before.
Tom licks a cow.
He called from Tokyo.
I've had the flu since Monday, and now the fever's gone down, but I'm not quite well yet.
It's new.

I'm hungry, so I'm gonna go get something to eat.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what he said?
I'm trying to get in touch with Tom, but I can't get him.
This is your first time in Japan?
We're trying to.
I thought I'd agree.
Where are you going?
Everyone is responsible for their own words.
I can't sleep at all.
I like tea.
In fact, he barely knows anything about it.
You must have seen this picture somewhere.
I've tried to kill myself twice.
He came to ask us for help.
Get back there!
Be careful you don't get the flu.
Tom is my brother.
Stop chasing the work.
Tom called me fat pussy.
Where are you going?
The church bells are ringing.
How much is this umbrella?
I don't know. Can't you ask Tom?
How much is this hat?

When I woke up, I was in the car.
Where are you now?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom just couldn't look away when Mary was being bullied.

What a great idea!
I'll admit he's real.
I make a hundred euros a day.
Well, I want to quit school.
The bathroom is free!
What did you just say?
Please don't laugh at me, I did too many stomach cramps last night and now my stomach aches.
Do you like black cats?
All the fuck!
Cherry blossoms are at their best.

Tom wants to learn to ride a bike.
Sami is two years younger than Tom.
Can I have some tea?
I wish we could have a weekend soon.
That's weird.
He's lying to me.
Get out of here!
You're not coming in?
Are things really in this order?
I don't remember when I first met her.
Found it!
Neither of them attended the meeting.
You look good with short hair.
Did you find the umbrella you said you lost the other day?
I have a bad appetite.
I decided to go there.
I'm glad I was of help to you last week.

Tom was a brave man.
Oh, my God!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom pretended not to know how to get to school.
Do you know anyone in Australia?
What time is it?
I have to go.
Take care of your own business.
I started to understand why he hated me.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
His accent revealed that he was French.
Jim is not a lawyer, he's a doctor.
That doesn't mean anyone could become a poet.
Can you turn on the air conditioner?
Tom lay ill with the flu.
He bought her a dog.
Tom gave an ambiguous answer.
I miss you, Tom.
Tom talks to me every day.
This place is a hospital.
When the train left, they waved goodbye to their parents.
He looks young for his age.
Looks like it's raining.
I'm studying Korean.
I don't know what to do!
Iron is a useful metal.
I wanna lose weight, but I just can't stop eating between meals.
Where's the exit?
You can't go outside after dinner.
I'll think about it.
I'm gonna have to be more careful.
Tom still can't swim very well.
If anything happens, tell me.
I took an hour on the train.
What I am today is your business.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I want to emphasize this point in particular.
I agree.
I'm innocent!

He's shown up to his mother.
I like Tom because he's honest.
I know Tom likes to travel.
I wish I could have met Tom.
Nice to meet you.
Can you pass me the salt?
Excuse me, but can I use your phone?
Don't give up on me.
You free on the first weekend?
Tom blew the candle out.
The woman talks just like a teacher.

I mean, really?
I mean, it's Saturday.
He helped an old man cross the street.
Come visit the village.
I didn't mean to bug you.
Have fun!

I'm saving money for my old age.
Can you give me a ride to the station?
I'm lost when you're gone.
When I became a student at the University of Tokyo, Japan's most influential university with an emphasis on education and excesses, I was paid the most of the 10,000 yen hourly salaries of home teachers.
Get a job.
What's your blood type?
Get the fuck out of my head!
Even if you complain, it's not worth it.
Open page nine.
Tom is handsome.
Can you open your bag?
You've never been in love, have you?
I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
I'm serious about this.
Tom is angry?
Tom was standing in line.
Just because he's a cop doesn't mean he's brave.
I have to write a few essays by tomorrow.
I'm totally broke.
Joni was lazy before she met you.

Oh, my God!
There are many places worth seeing.
Tigre ran from the zoo.
I don't want to get married, but I want kids.
The food is frozen.
I'm studying art history.
Stop delaying the strike!
Can you tell me how to get to the beach?
Have a wish.
Tom isn't as young as he looks.
Use your head.

Wait a minute.
I know exactly how it feels.
If you wanna go home, I won't mind if you do.
The first half of the story takes place in Boston.
It doesn't hurt.
I told him to leave the room.
Who's the composer you like the most?
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the station?
Mayuko hasn't slept enough.
The report revealed that many teenagers are alcoholics.

Don't blame me for that.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Can you turn on the lights?
The book is simple.
Can you show me something else?

Can I have the bill, please?
Can I help you?
Do you have a PlayStation 3?
Are you in a bad mood?
He told her he loved this.
I can't live a month on 10,000 yen.
You're all tired already, aren't you?

Have you spoken to Tom's parents?
Tom fell ill because he was overdoing it.
We need to investigate the doctor's disappearance.
How hungry are you, Tom?
You know her?
If you ask Tom, he'll help you.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
Even though I only have a small amount of money, you let me donate it all.

Grandpa started getting older, so he retired.
When the phone rang, I was in the bathroom.
I'm hungry. I'm going to eat.
Tom was in Boston at the time.
A total rejection of the boy, he didn't know what to do.
I eat breakfast every morning.
What is this?
Tom went to the park to meet Marin.
I couldn't bear to go out tonight.
Iron is a useful metal.

Bill didn't mean that he had to obey him.
He arrived on the other side in thirty minutes.
Tom said he had to ask Mary where she put her camera.
When I wait for my friend for a long time, I get restless.
You did it!
I'm training.
Can you forgive me?
I'm telling you, his speech is always boring.
A terrible tyrant!
Tom is in Boston on business.
I'm a little bit of a rascal.
Excuse me, but what did you say?
The most important thing in life is to live your life for yourself.
Tom is probably fine.
Have you lived here before?
Who is this?
Can you take your hat off?
He lives a busy life, so he doesn't usually meet his family.
I have one thing I'd like you to look at.
I'm married and have two children.
Can we go somewhere for a drink?

He sells vegetables.
He's a real gentleman.
I'm dying of hunger!
I can't forget his orvekin eyes.
I'd like to climb Mount Fuji again.
! That's great!
How many kids do you have?
Papa slept through the whole movie.
Excuse me, but can you check the oil in my car?
You're not gonna tell anyone about this, are you?

Just like that.
What's wrong with the boy? Have you been misled? Would you like your aunt to take you to a meeting place for lost children?

Tatoeba is a project where the Earth's inhabitants are the central figure.

The roof leaked.
What do you like?
That torch is on his left.
If you make your own clothes, you'll save a lot of money.
You're right, you're right.
Enjoy your vacation.
How windy it is.
Excuse me, please.
I like it.
Tom will come to our school tomorrow.
How did that happen?
Impossible!
Wait a minute.
Tom saw something red there.
Have you got a bonus card?
You must have breakfast.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I ask you how old you are?
I came to Tokyo three years ago and I've lived here ever since.
I was sure he'd help me.
What do you like to do on Sundays?
You must use his name to make a reservation.
I'd be happy to do anything for you.
I didn't know there was a light.
Don't be late!
Who are you sending them to?
Yesterday it rained.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
A minute.
Don't lie to us.
What's your name?
Let's say he knows the secret.
What kind of things do you like?
Don't be so pessimistic about it.
I wanted a jacket.
Tom hadn't been to Boston.
I'm always ready to help you.
Don't cry for Tom.
I have to go outside.
If the weather is good tomorrow, I'll go for a walk.
Get up, Tom!
Tom didn't want to disturb Mary when Mary was studying.
$10 postal address, please.
Now that you're 18, you should have a better judgment.
And that's the fault?
Can you give me your cell phone number?
Oil was found in the North Sea.
This is insane.
I don't know anything about your feelings and I don't want to know.
Cool!
Get this over with.
You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
Have you ever had alcohol?
The guy who's staring at the ball and shooting.
The property was divided between three brothers.
He decides on new procedures.
The whale was found off the coast of Wakayama.
Why do you ask?
Never seen a baby so cute before!
What a wonder!

I don't remember.
I don't like to borrow money or even borrow money.
I have a back problem.
As soon as the time and place is decided, I will contact you again.
How was lunch?
You're just gonna stand there all day?
I'm eating here.
I can't learn a foreign language fully by myself.
He goes to Tokyo every now and then for work.
Welcome to the shopping!
He was cleaning his room in a hurry.
He's working in the factory.
I'm sorry, I can't remember anything but this.

It's a lovely day.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I don't like the way he talks.
I wish I knew.
We couldn't go outside because of the heavy rain.
Tom has tattoos all over his body.
I've got a lot of work to do today.
I can't afford a camera as good as yours.
I want to see you again.
Come here!
That's a very attractive idea.
The city is confused about the waste management problem.
He's never had a bad experience.
I'll take care of it!
What time do you leave?
Tom went?
What is this made of?
Tom was killed?
I'm going to go on a picnic tomorrow.
I'm on top of it.
If there were no water, no living thing could live.
Tom likes cats?
You're all right.
Get over there!
Generally speaking, women live longer than men.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I can't afford to eat in a restaurant this expensive.
The story he told us recently makes no sense.
I mean, it's been a while since we've met.
Who knows?
Tom visited Mary's house yesterday.
How's your work going?
My father has never been ill before.
I'm worried about your health.
I'm too tired to run.
I know.
Tom looked up into the sky.
Why are you studying?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I feel everywhere.
Tom is in a bad mood now.
Tom has tropical fish.
There were a lot of guests in the room.
Ask me something easier.
You gonna help me or what?
Why was she so angry?
I saw it.

What made him do that?
I can't see Tom.
That's nice.
They're dating each other.
I bought her a doll.
You're like your father.
Tom has cancer.
Yesterday there was an earthquake.
I'm not busy.
I don't need it.
I met him on the street.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Thank you for helping me with my homework.
I lost my watch.
Tom lost his sight.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm thinking about it again.
The girl who likes me is right there.
Tom didn't expect to fall in love with Mary.
You going to the party today?
Show me something else.
Bankes open at nine.
I don't really care.
I don't know if George is coming or not.
Where did they come from?
What happened?
Can you turn on the TV?
I got out of bed before it was dark.
So did I.
Yes, I did.
They live hand to mouth.
The boat slipped steadily downstream.
What time does the meeting start?
It started raining the moment we left.
I was unfair.
Can you hear me?
Let me be with you for another five minutes.
A young man is singing in front of the door.

Don't talk your ass off.
He's still at work.
Can you take your hat off?
Tom looks really sleepy.
I'll call you back later, okay?
Have you got milk?
If you don't want to wear sunscreen, that's your problem, but don't come complaining to me if you burn yourself.
Tom lost 30 kg.
He bought a chicken.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is a good friend.
I'm not gonna change my mind, no matter what you say.
I don't need it anymore.
You're not running in class.
The man was sentenced to life.
He's not like his wife.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You hate me?
There's hardly any coffee left in the pan.
Tom wasn't married.
Wash your face.
Pizza is two shots per person.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I wanna go for a ride.
He's got a car.
I just got to the station.
Bob became a priest.
It's really cold today, isn't it?
It's too expensive!
Once upon a time there was a castle on that hill.
If you have something to complain about, go away!

I have a suggestion.
Mom, come on, everybody's waiting!
You got the idea?
Nothing was seen.
You cooked the food, so I'm gonna pee.
I was down all day.
I still love you, Tom! Can't we try it again?Hmmm, let me think about it.
I'm really fat.
Have a great weekend!
You look tired.
Hello to everyone.
I'm totally open.
Tom said words of comfort to Mary.
Long time!

That's a good idea.
Can you wake me up at 6:00 tomorrow morning?
Have a nice trip!
Can you turn off the lights?
Tom bought sandwiches.
Oh, there's snow coming!
Relax!
Jump!
Get back in your seat.
I'm on my day off.

Tom was not present at the meeting.
The wedding is on Saturday.
Tom got into the car.
I think he seems honest.
I must admit I was careless.
Tom gave a round-the-clock answer.
How about another beer?
I'm sorry, I don't understand what the question means.
I'm totally screwed.
You'd better go.
That's just his way.
He always keeps his room clean.

Mayuko has forbidden the rumor.
I'm almost there.
I couldn't help but cry.
I can't explain.
Who gave you that?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Are you full?
️Not everyone wants to be an artist.
How deep?
What did you have for dinner last night?
He's the last person I wanna meet.
In a day or two, you won't be able to go around and see everything in Tokyo.
Why was my name removed from the list?
The family ate dinner together.

Teacher never said anything like that.
What's your dad doing?
I got it!
He's a good tennis player.
Can you cover the table?
See you later.
Wait, what are you doing?
Mama's cooking dinner.
Well, I was having lunch.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm glad I have a great library.
The son paid no attention to his father's advice.
We used to play chess after school.
I have a big house.
I don't spin and clap.
Get up!
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
Get this on you.
No pearls for pigs.
How much is the entrance fee?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There was nothing left in the fridge.
He was proud to present his new cell phone.
I'm hurting my foot.
Whose umbrella is this?
Wind coming from the west.
You think Tom is lying to us?
It smells bad!
Tom is taller than me.
Someone beat Tom with a scalpel, but he's fine now.
I have a lot of fever.
If the source is not marked, the quote is no longer a quote, but a plagiarism.
Tom watched TV all day.
I'm finished.
I'm gonna make sure you don't get the flu.
Did you get what you wanted?
Have you asked Tom?
Mari doesn't know what to say to her.
He had great success in his work.
Tom nodded.
Do something!
Put one word in the closing.
I don't have the stuff for a politician.
I'm sorry you had to wait.
"Tom is calling again?""Yeah, he calls every night these days. I shouldn't have given him my number".
I'm Japanese, but you're American.
I don't have a computer at home.
I decided right away that I would get the $1,000,000 I needed within a week.
Can't find my glove.
Have you ever driven your feet?
Where are you going?
Tom seems very happy.
Isn't that great?
I hope I never see him again.
Tom may come anytime.
I was just in the bathroom when the phone rang.
You don't run in class.
I almost don't like it.
Tom said he was quitting smoking.
I need some copy paper.
I live here.
I'd like another beer.
That was the first time Tom saw the Golden Gate Bridge.
Tom crossed the street.
What is the use of learning an artificial language?
You love me?
You're over 18?
I'm not drinking alcohol.
Tom wants to go abroad next year.
We have to go.
I miss you.
Help me, I'm crying!

Can I have some tea?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That's right.
What are you so nervous about?

Excuse me, but can I borrow your phone?
What is it?
Get back there!
I'm leaving in an hour.
I'm gonna live in a room that's been there for four years.
I'm afraid to walk around these parts at night.
Don't panic about that.
Tom put his wallet on the table.
I don't have a pencil.
The monkey who went to the village from the mountain to play found a red candle on the way. Red candles were rare at the time, which made the monkey convinced that he had found a firework. The monkey carried the red candle carefully back to the mountain.
Why did you buy flowers?
The old man gave the child protection.
I'm sorry I'm late for your reply.
We all agree that we're leaving early.
Where did he get his picture?
I think German is the best language in the world.
His father is Japanese.

Do you have a bonus card?No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can I ask you something?
He was happy with the result.
Papa often goes to America for work.
You should have good relations with your neighbors.
Jump!
I'll ask him about it tomorrow.
It's too small.
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry I was late.

Where did you take your shoes off?
Be careful driving.
I'm a student at the university.
Blue suit, white shirt and red tie are essential to the equipment of all male workers.
I am innocent.
Come home now.
I'd like another beer.
See you at school tomorrow!
When I find something I want, it's definitely something expensive.
Turns out he was dead a long time ago.
When he grows up, he's gonna be a doctor.

Show me the picture.
What are you doing tomorrow?I thought I'd go to the movies, but then I got a job and I can't go.
Playing on the road is dangerous.
Can you solve the math problem?
Tom yelled loud as the sound of his head.
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
Call me tomorrow at 9:00.
He filed a lawsuit.
I don't know what happened to Tom.
Let's keep in touch.
Keep working even while I'm gone.
Yeah, that's right.
I just went to the barbershop.
Turn button will start loading.
Bob's patience could no longer bear the reproach of his wife.
Get out of here. I want to be alone.
Tom must be scared.
You have a good musical personality.
I was having lunch.

We disagree at all.
Pearls for pigs.
Where's your school?
I've decided to resign at the end of this month.
Take it easy now.
I can't wait any longer.
Hui, I was scared, so don't make such loud noises.
I like going to the baseball games.
He's mad at me.
He played tennis.

The area of Tōhoku is worth a visit.
Mixed.
Jim didn't wake until his mother woke him up.

The sky is dark.
I could give anything to get a cold drink.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Excuse me, which way is the station?
Whoever loses the stone-paper-sacks, scratches today!
The life of the citizens is always secondary.
Get something on, so you don't get the flu.
You should go to sleep.
Tom pulsed.
You know why he's so mad at you?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Is that what you really want to do?
I put a cloth mark on my daughter's bag for her.
Don't waste your time on the unimportant.
Sometimes, prices change without notice.
There once was a cat named Tango.
How old are you?
He won that race easily.
Have fun!
I have my birthday tomorrow.
Don't just stand there, get in the car!
I'm biased.
This is your first doctor visit?
Let's keep in touch.
The food was really good.
He was immersed in his work.
When can we meet again?
You can't find that anywhere.
I told you!
️Don't tap your cell phone while you're eating.
Banking is rising because interest rates are falling.
Thanks.No way to thank you.
Come here, I wanna show you something.
Yesterday we had fish for dinner.
Tom, if you don't go, then I won't go.
He's happy.
My father has never been ill before.
Both officers were exhausted.
Let's stop working today.
It's too expensive.
Is that a recent picture?

Can you introduce yourself briefly?
Tom moved.
I started studying French three years ago.
Yeah, I think so too.
I had a strange dream last night.
He called me.
I booked a doctor's appointment for two.
That's right.
Why is there a school when it's so cold?
I'm a prisoner.
Don't laugh at him for making a mistake.
I'm from Sapporos.
I confessed.
He always thinks first of his own interests.
Jesus Christ!
I'm a family of four.
Don't put your books on the table.

Are you still tired?
How old are your kids?
I have to go now.
Who do you live with?
This is not a sentence.
The reporter can smell good news.
I've been lying down sick since Monday.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Kati was forced to read the book.
Don't ask me what I'm saying.
I'm thirsty.
He didn't show up for the last meeting.
All the people in the audience were foreigners.
Do you know who this is?
I'm wearing a green sweater.
Get the fuck out of my head!
Hey, how old is Suzuki?
Can I get a glass of water?
Shut up!
I keep a diary.
Black Tom is actually a good guy.
Come visit me on your way home.
You're a Japanese student?
Why does it sting when it's sweaty?
Come into my office.
How old do you want to be married?
I'm not the channel, am I?
Tom is interested in mathematics.
I thought you didn't have any money.
He reached for the knife, but he didn't reach it.
I like English, but I don't speak it well.
Joni took the key out of her pocket.
What's your favorite TV show?
I'll join you later.
I can't make my own decisions.
Tom goes to school on foot.
Dinner is not good for your health.
What kind of a star sign would a man be good for a woman who's a bull?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I hear you got a new girlfriend.
They saw him go into the room.
A small stream creates a big river.
Galileo Galilei
Where is your school?
Tom doesn't listen to me.
What is this?
I'm kidding you.
The baby started crying.
Hey, you guys want to order pizza?
Are you in a lot of pain?
Why are you so unhappy?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You can trust him.
Is there anything else you want me to do?
Tom is handsome.
Can you hold on a sec?
Japanese headgear look exactly like apples.
Tom is dead.

I'm so ashamed of myself.
Get up, Tom!
Who did you want to talk to?
Water, please.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Let's see!
Tom is forgetful.

Tom was in a circle.
The year before, we went to London.
Don't go away.
I've never seen such a terrible accident.
I think I should ask Tom.
Tom went white.
I hardly ever walk to work.
Why are you still upstairs?
Always wondered why you didn't wear socks?
Tom doesn't have a TV at home.
I have pain in my feet.
Get more details from the office.
You should tell me the truth.
I'm a little bit broke right now.
I don't think I want to go out tonight.
Can you tell me how to get to the beach?
The recommended duration of the presentation is not more than 30 minutes.
That dress suits you well.
We voted against the proposal.
What does that mean?
You work hard, but don't put too much pressure on yourself.
I don't want to ruin Tom's day off.
What language do you usually speak to Tom?
I didn't say that.
I can't wait for summer to come.
Keep that smile.
You can come whenever you want.
Generally speaking, women live ten years longer than men.
My mother married my father in the 80s.
You think of Tom?
Do you think there's gonna be anything interesting coming from the TV?
He told her a joke, but she didn't think it was funny.
Tom's hands are big.
Tom refused decisively.
The critic always says things briefly and in a very basic way.
How many days does it take?
Can you please reserve this place for me?
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
The train just arrived.
Tom knows how to keep his mouth shut.
He ignored her, and it was thoughtless.
That's a good idea.
I don't like being treated like a child.
The wind is blowing.
He just left.
If you don't have a job, can you help me?
Marie has no idea what she should say to her.
It's none of his business.
Well, it's obvious now that Tom's hiding something.
Long time!
I'm sorry I offended you.
He did it!
I didn't just say I was sorry.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What time is it now?
In addition to catalogues, the means of communication may include advertising letters, magazine and newspaper advertisements, radio and television advertising and telephone sales.
Tom is my friend.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm sure of it.
I'd like to walk a little slower.
If you translate from your second language into your mother tongue, you are likely to make fewer mistakes than when you translate the opposite.
Tom is right.
Can you tell me?
We're between a tree and a shell.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Tom sneaked out of the classroom.
Where does this Tom live?
Have you ever seen a UFO?
I'm in a hurry now.
What the hell?
We waited a long time, but he never showed up.
How beautiful these flowers are!
I have to go now.
I'm studying French next year.
This is not a funny thing. If someone did that to you, what would you like? What would you do? she said.
I got on the wrong bus.
Tom forgets things easily.
I'm hungry. I'm going to eat.
You're the only one who can save the world.
Tom knows how to keep a secret.
What are you looking for?
How do you spend New Year's Eve?
I'm lucky compared to him.
Let's go get some food.
There are no arches.
Tom is a student of ten, isn't he?
Don't you know where Tom is?
"Tom, do you have school today?""No, we have school free because of the typhoon".
I wish summer would come soon.
Baseball is different from cricket.
Tom expressed his disagreement.
Tom is loyal to his wife.
Get some cookies if you like.
Tom, we're talking to you.
Java and JavaScript are different from each other just like India and Indonesia are different.
I'm sure you'll like to make sure the lights are turned off when you go home.
We waited for the bus in line.


I'm tired of writing.
That hotel is run by his uncle.
I'm going to bed at 11:00.
George is five years older than me.
I wanted a jacket.

If the start is good, it's almost half done.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He bought his son a camera.

He woke up from the bench.
Wait!
Worrying won't help.
I mean, it's been a while since we've met.
I'm on very good terms with my aunt.
If I had to choose, I'd take a log house.
He's in great danger.
Can you give me a pillow and a blanket?
Turn left of that street corner.
Can I have some milk, please?
What made you do this?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's your call.
Tom and I are friends.
How do I get on the number seven bus?
He's an old friend of mine.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not
Nothing compares to home.
Excuse me for interrupting.

Come home now.
Why do you bother me all the time?
The previous owner of the place was always smiling, but the new one seems to be a very shy person.
He succeeded, thanks to his hacker work.
Even if you try your best, you won't succeed so easily.
He has no resistance to his wife.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You're good with short hair.
He wants something cold to drink.
I started crying.
He doesn't just speak German and French, he also speaks English.
He's proud of his looks.
Ninni is a girl that I find difficult to deal with.
Can I use this bottle?
Tom lived a short life.
I was probably wrong.
Excuse me, could you hand me a little pepper?
I wish I was an only child.
Can you close the window for me?
I've been in a bad mood all day.
I'm not tired.
If you go on a bullet train, you're under a time zone.
I want to meet Tom.
I'm almost there.
Has he children?
Excuse me, could I have a double-ball, normal-sized, dark brown, delicious mint sauce and orange sorbet, please?
Sometimes, prices change without notice.
I live near the toy store.
I can't get my mind off of my stolen money.
Are you sad?
The cause of the fire is mostly known.
Tom caught a big fish.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Take care of your own business.
I don't remember making any money from that job.
to be honest, I don't like your hairstyle.
Nothing was seen.

Hey, Tom, you just came in a good time, so I'd like to ask you something.
Tom was late to the station.
She held onto her husband's bottom.
Life is fun.
Trolling is an art form.
I slept like a haircut last night.
I'm not expecting the kid to be worse.
Papa's in the kitchen.
I've known him for over 20 years.
I'm sorry, I'm halfway there, I'm asleep. I'm not sleeping.
I think women who are moderate are generally the most beautiful, and those who are loud are terrible.

Tom gave me a pencil.
What do you say we get you something to drink?
Tom is back with his ex.
Tom still can't swim.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He gave each of them a lead.
Tom is too confident.
Who knows what's gonna happen?
Can I have your phone number?
When the summer is over, I'm gonna have an exam.
Tom is a man who is difficult to handle.
Don't smoke in here.
I'd like to have these scratches fixed.
Put all the non-learning items in your bags.
Come here!
Red clothes fit him well.
Who told you that?
I'm sure you are.
Call the police.
I don't have a job, so I can't put money in the savings.
I'll take the job on the condition that you help me.
Tom forced me to work hard.Y again?
Can you get help?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's your friend?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Complaining is useless.
My mother was up late last night.
Get on the train!
I haven't seen you in a while.
I have to go.
Tom is my age.
I'm going on a breakfast trip tomorrow.
Tom has no idea what it's like to be in love.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I believe in God.
I like this school.
Are you an exchange student?
Tom is an electrical engineer.
Can I get a call from Miko?
Buy a tofu on the way back.
He was wearing a red sweater.
If you want to hear a scary story, I'll tell you about a dream I had a few weeks ago.
Can you write it down for me?
He was a rare man once.
I'm not a Nazi!
Tom hasn't cared about me lately.
Why am I so picky when it's cold?
Have you decided on the baby's name?
I bit him.
How can you eat such nasty shit?
He was just trying to get a chance to try it.
Have you got cough pastilles?
Doctors told Tom that Mary would not recover according to the predictions.
Tom is still crying.
He didn't know how to finish it.
I hope you're well soon.
What do you want for Christmas?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm telling you, his speech is always boring.
Start time.
In a democracy, all citizens have equal rights.
"Here's a picture of my big brother visiting the village."Wow, you're like two berries! Are you here, Tom?"Not right. I'm there."
We've been attacked.
Can you turn it down?
The food's gone cold.
Where are you going?
The wind is blowing from the west.
Tom never took a look at his girlfriend.
I have to go to school.
The combined death toll of police and firefighters killed in terrorist attacks rose to hundreds.
Get off this ship now.
Tom was moving.
Tom got sick because he ate too much.
Tom whispered.
Can you recommend a good camera?
Oh, my God!
He's good at handball.
I can't do this job alone.
Do you think love can be born without physical contact? Sure, but it depends on the other party.
It was a very cold winter.
He's a little out of business with women, so you better keep your eye on him.
We must go now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I don't remember getting paid for that job.
I like her very much.
He has a beautiful handwriting.
Can you tell us?
I'm terrified of snakes.
He just got home from overseas.
You don't happen to know what my keys are?
Tom wanted Mary to stay put until she came back.
Tom walked through the door.
Where is the gate for Japan Airlines Flight 124?
Where do you wanna go?
All for the day.
Mary sued her own mother.
Relax!
We have plenty of time.
Tom peeled an apple.
Tom was born in the middle.
That's a great idea!
I really like her!
Let's ask him.
I can swim.
What's the matter?
Did you watch football yesterday?Well, of course I did!
7:45am the other day.
I thought it was close.
When you think of the pros and cons, I don't think it's about love.
That's a good idea.
You're lucky he didn't cheat on you.
Don't talk food in your mouth!
Tom thinks it's impossible for Marin to break the record.
Tom is bad at sports.
Why don't you believe me?
The wedding was postponed.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Where are you going?
He broke his leg when he fell on his bike.
Tom is the strongest.
I hate snakes not only for their body shape, but also for their murky movements.
I wish I was born Canadian.
Tom asked for a raise.
Tom is lying.
A large crowd came to the party.
Who broke this?
Tom has nothing to eat.
Tom was near death last summer.
I let the old lady sit in my seat.
Katy was reading that book.
Excuse me, can you give me some advice on how to get to the post office?
Turn left of that street corner.
Never been to Paris.
The painting looks exactly right.
This never ends.
He's really nice, just like you.
Now get out of bed!
I have a fast pulse.
What's in here?
I'm giving up.
Don't give up halfway.
The sun shone over the horizon.
Don't go in there now.
Thank you for inviting me.
You made the right decision.
Pressing this button and the door opens.
Tom scandalizes women.
I'm sick of the flu.
I should have come by bicycle.
If you don't speed up, you'll miss the last train.
Tom asked for a raise.
I like Heaven because he's so nice.
All the fuck!
Tom is honest with his wife.
What do you do when you're on vacation?
5 litres of normal, please.
Tom is not here.
I'll be back by 7:30.
You're not tired?
What do you say we get you something to drink?
Can I have the bill, please?
Tom looked as if he had seen a ghost.
I have a present for you.
Auto almost hit me.
It was just a joke.
He wore a black hat.
I'm awake now.
What's in that cupboard?
Auto almost hit me.
Tom likes Mary.
Can I borrow this pencil?
You're the hard worker.
I only started squash a few months ago.
I want a cup of tea.
Hey, if the food isn't ready by 7:00, then I'm going to the restaurant.
Get up!
The city was completely covered in snow.
Do you like apples or bananas more?
Markku never performed on stage, so he was nervous.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I went skiing for the first time this winter.
Do you have any issues?
What are the differences between religion and philosophy?
Let's ask him for advice.
Have you ever eaten Mexican?
Do you think I'm handsome?
George weighs at least 70 kg.
Have fun!
Tom plays with his toys.

That's great!
I'm being fair.
How did that happen?

Thank you so much for coming.
I don't have any money.
Tom doesn't have his own office.
Tom has big hands.

You're not wasting water.
Tom is not stupid.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Storm broke the windows.

Ah, I've been here before!
Which blood type are you in?
How did you know?
Coffee, please.
I'm going to eat an apple.
Tom fell and hit his ankle.
Tom got off the bike.
Tom went down to the lake.
I'm sorry. I had to be a little early, but I talked about the odds and then I took it and I was late.
If you saw her, you'd think she was a girl.
I wish there was no Facebook and the like.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The only way to know what happened is to ask Tom.
Tom cleaned his glasses.
How was the test?
Why do you apologize?
I'll be right there.
Get the fuck out of here.
Tom is gone?
I don't care how you do it, as long as you do it.
I'm a student.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom didn't want it.
I work just because I like to do work.
Anne has many friends.
What's your name?
Let's keep in touch.
Most smokers say they want to quit.
Where are the toothpastes?
I'm applying for a German course soon.
I don't have any money for Latin Latin.
I went to bed early.
I can't seem to explain how difficult it is.
You're Japanese?
I've got a lot to do this afternoon.
Tom dyed his hair black.
I have to go now.
How would you solve that problem?
Unfortunately, the rumor was true.
Tom speaks fast.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Can I have salt, please?
This is the hotel we lived in at the time.
Have you finished reading the book?
He has a loud voice.
That's not necessary.

I was delighted.
Wake me up at 7:00.
Traffic is down due to an accident.
What was your major in college?
Trees are on fire.
It's strange that he came home so late.
He visited his home country for the last time over ten years ago.
The concert was a full-length concert.
Relax now.
That patient won't last the summer.
I have to go now.
If you're ready, eat fruit.
The report return date is approaching, so I'm in a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
Where do you wanna go?
I have a headache.
If you're having a fever, you'd better stay home.
He did it!

I can help you anytime.
Don't stare at the others!
Often helps others.
I went outside despite the rain.
All writers write in their own style.
He copied the picture of the book in his notebook.
He kept talking while eating.
Tom comes to Boston once a year.
Tom still can't read.
Who are you waiting for?
Why is he here?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's a little shy.
You found the umbrella you said you lost a couple of days ago?
What's inside the box?
Germans are very clever.
Have you ever climbed Fujitsu?
Tom thought of taking a dog.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Even if I tried to play professional baseball, I don't think I would have any luck.
There's a little problem here.

Of course you are!
Never said anything so stupid.
Contact is the button that starts loading.
What did you have for breakfast?
My mom is always busy and she's just running around.
This town is dear to us.
What's wrong with him?

I hope we'll meet again.
Wait a minute.
You like coffee?
Can I have it at 6:00?
Take it easy now.
He's used to keeping watch late at night.
I got a weird e-mail.
Can I borrow this pencil?
Tom is our guest.
Tom wanted to meet you.
I'm on very good terms with my aunt.
What languages does Tom speak?
I want to be alone.
Why do I need a lawyer?
The boy was silent.
Clean the toilet after use.
Why are you laughing?
It started raining.
Why did he quit his job?
Be kind to the old man.
I believe in it.
Tom closed the door quietly and sneaked into the room.
Tom doesn't talk.
Tom died in a car accident.
Thank you for your help.
You're too young to travel alone.
I'm alone.
Do you think I'm fat?
You're going to tell us?
Green light!
Tom and I have been friends for many years.
I got him to go to the doctor.
Where are you going?

Tell me what you did on vacation.
I'm studying Russian on the radio.
He was accepted into the family before long.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I just saw that accident.
You speak French very well. Where did you study it?
What time is it there now?
The bird flew away and disappeared.
How was the test?
He was waited for two hours at the station.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I have some money.
"Tom, where are you?""Here!""Here?"
Can I have a glass of wine?
Friends congratulated me on my success.
I'm just kidding you.
Even a stopped clock shows the right time twice a day.
Don't leave it to chance.
You don't have to change in a hurry.
Is it true that horses sleep standing?
Thank you so much for loving a miserable man like me.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't hold back.
I'm used to the cold weather.
If we hadn't been in an accident, we'd have been there in time.
What is Tom's most important point?
Ninni is a girl that I find difficult to handle.
Tom didn't know what to say.
He started his voyage around the world on a sailing ship.
Pauli made a lot of money last year.
How's life in Germany?
It's important, so I'm going to do it.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Keep your hands clean.
Mama said she'd be fine.
Tom closed the water tank.
You're threatening me?
Behave yourself!
Tom grew up in Boston.
He likes blue.
Hot water not only washes away the sweat, dirt, and worries of the day but also gives you the pleasure of talking about everyday life.
This movie is a wolf.
My mother married my father in the '80s.
Don't care what he said.
Can you explain the procedure to me?
Does anyone know Tom's last name?
The dogs are barking.
I don't speak French at all.
I wish I could get along with the whole class.
I love her so much, I could die.
Can you wake me up tomorrow morning?
I didn't order this.
Who painted this painting?
I had a stroke.
I'm sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.
This movie sucks.
I haven't seen him very often lately.
I don't like this.
What kind of stuff did you buy?
What's the biggest difference?
I'm getting hurt when I'm getting my toes cut off.
Tom quit smoking.
What do you like?
He just became dean.
I've never tasted mango before.
Tom admitted his mistake.
Talk to me!
Can you show me your ticket?
Tom fell into the water.
The last person I told my idea thought I was crazy.
I heard someone singing nearby.
That's my CD.
Excuse me, where's the taxi?
I made a promise.
Tom understands.
Have you got something to do on Saturday?
I don't care what you say.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm glad we talked for a long time.
I'm going to ask Tom.
Tom drove the car.
So you've decided on your thesis?
I knew you'd be mad.
I'm sorry I always leave the chores to you.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You live in Tokyo, right?
What would you do today?
Sami is two years younger than Tom.
How about another cup of tea?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Oh, no, I forgot my wallet!
What's your impression of America?
I'm hurting my foot.
Playing guitar is fun.

Tom is visible.
I'm sorry. I'm half an hour late because I slept on the bomb.
I'm so sorry I was this late.
I wonder if I could try cooking?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
How was your weekend?
Kati felt pity for her.
A terrible weather!
Have you got anything to bring?
I'm sorry, I really don't remember anything more than this.
Tom and Mary played thieves and cops.
Tom put salt in the egg.
He looked sad when he read the letter.
I hardly ever walk to work.
Why am I so tired?
He took off his coat.
You're a human being.
The guy today was so special, I couldn't keep up with him.
You can't fight the laws of nature.
Tom became terribly lonely.
They left last night.
Can you spare me a few minutes?
How about you stop and think about your own past?
Tell me what you did on vacation.
Can I get a beer?
Don't hesitate to express your opinion.
Can I pay you, please?
How much was that beer?
Tom is loyal to his wife.
I passed the letter to him in secret.
Good night!

Yeah, well, if the food isn't ready by 7:00, I'm gonna go to the restaurant.
I look forward to tomorrow.
The person I thought was his father turned out to be someone else.
Let me cheat for a while.

How can I help you?
Where do you work?
Bus stop is right next door.
I couldn't stop laughing.
Don't think about it.
What time is it?
He's smarter than anyone.
Follow you!
I'll be right back.
Tom fell into the river.
Tom drew this picture.
Our plane flew above the clouds.
Tom shed tears.

I'll see you at the library tomorrow.
Can I buy traveler's checks with this credit card?
I'm going to choose this.
The more excited he was, the less mean he became.
You can trust Jack.
He was thirsty.
I think that in Japan, food is expensive.
Nobody understands me.
Tom thought Mary loved him.
I dreamed of it.
Joni is smart.
Tom?
I got my hands on a flashlight.
Have you fulfilled your wish?
How old is your father?
Your book is on the table.
You did it!
How could I be a robot?
I was down all day.

How to cook?Well, somehow, but there's no guarantee of taste.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
Tom's chest is uncovered.

He felt insecure.
He was broken by grief.
Oksé woke up?
I'm totally open.
The speech would suggest the corruption of political circles.
I don't know why the meeting was postponed.
Do you want to have a drink?
Rain stopped, so they kept playing.
I got a mat in the corn.

I wish I lived in Boston.
This is a nice skirt. Can I try this?
Thank you for helping me fix this.
Tom and Mary have a bad relationship.
Get home safe and sound.
I'm sorry you had to wait so long.
He went to work even though he had the flu.
I'm sure it's going to rain.
I'm a photographer by trade.
Sometimes I take the bus and sometimes I take the car
I'm doing great!
I'm awfully tired.

Can you show me something else?
Let's go find the buried treasure.
I'll be back next week.
Knowing and doing are two different things.
Can I have a glass of milk, please?
I'm the one who should be blamed.
I am a free woman.
Thank you for the Christmas present!

He ate insects and spiders.
No more!
Tom has some friends in Boston.
Can I pay for it in parts?
He's looking for work.
Ten years is a long time.
His thesis is easy to read because it's written in this simple style.
I've been having a little bit of a bad appetite lately.
When and where should we meet?
I feel like even though I've been sleeping off sleep lately, it's not enough.
How many people do you think will come to the class meeting?
My grandfather likes to walk.
I played too much pachinko, so my wife got mad at me.
I have to go to bed.
There's one thing I'd like to ask you.
We need to investigate the doctor's disappearance.
I can stay.
Can you give me a ride to the station?
Come and sit down here, please.

A dog doesn't learn new tricks.
When your face starts to look like your passport, it's time to go on vacation.
He had a bad habit of drinking too much wine.
Can I ask your name?
"Don't you think this bag is cute?""Yeah, it's a bitch!"
I still think Tom is hiding something.
You're going to be fine.
When they talk about me, I like this the most.
The clouds seem threatening today, so I think it's best to skip surfing.
Cherries are red.
I'll be right there.
I'm glad I could be of help.

I have a suggestion.
I love you so much.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
There are many good restaurants around here.
All right, I'm Mike, please.
And I thought it went well.
Tom seems to be asleep.
That's a pretty good story.
Do you plan on going somewhere this summer?
Can I come in?
Have you prepared for tomorrow?
Maybe I don't look like a muscle, and I'm telling you, I do.
Have you ever eaten a tomato with sugar?
He doesn't know much about Japan.
Tom has already eaten lunch.
I wish I was dead.
Tom turned off the water.
When will Tom return?
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
What's that in your hand?
        
Nothing was seen.
I can't wait any longer.
Why did you do this?
Tom is thirty years old.
High fence surrounds the garden on all sides.
Joni is good at chess.
I wanted to talk more, but he hit me in the ear.
When I started studying at the highest point of Japanese education-centric society, Tokyo University, the most surprising thing was paying ten thousand yen an hour to home teachers.
Have you had a good lunch?
Tom was caught up in his mother's self-satisfaction.
You're so good at French!
Tom knows the machines well.
Spider-Man is cool, but spiders aren't.
I agree with you.
He had a book in his hand.
Marie wanted to see what she saw online.
Clean your room.
He's finished painting.
Never too late to learn.
Hello, by the way.
He's the boy who spoke to us recently.
Why is this vegetable called English?
Are you OK?
This is the best I can do right now.
I'm in a hurry now.
Ken wants a bike.
Get on with it!
Don't you support this plan?
Why?
Excuse me, could you pass me the salt?
Prime Minister signed the proclamation.
When I travel, I prefer to fly.
I don't know what you're trying to say.
I wanted a jacket.
Tom was silent.
I'll call you later.
No place can compete with France for good quality wines.
He's a little shy.
He decided to quit smoking.
How busy I am.
We talked quietly, not to wake the baby.
Can I talk to Tom about this?
Do they all have lead?
I don't know what the hell Tom was thinking.
Listen to me.
Reduce your shape after washing.
Don't lie to me.
My father is always angry.
Tom yelled at Mary because she didn't call to tell him she was going to be late.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Apels in a day keep the doctor away.
Our company is headquartered in Tokyo.
He's good at making excuses.
Can you look at those papers for me?
Who is this wedding?
Although Tom is sick, he intends to finish his homework on time.
I'll be waiting at the bus stop.
Can I come back tomorrow?
He didn't say anything.
There are many wild animals around here.
I've wanted to be a painter for a long time.
I have a lot of homework to do.
You borrow books.
Yeah, I think so too.

Can I have a bill?
How much does one person pay?
I made his burden easier.
How much is this umbrella?
It's in your best interest to study now.
What's the difference between a mini-hime and a micro-hime?
You have to clean yourself up and start studying.
Why are you in such a hurry?
Tom was not allowed to tell Mary everything he knew.
Facebook or something?
Always a bad thing to do.
Get back to your seat.
Tom has a dog phobia.
What did Tom say about me?
I'm already full.
I have nothing to give.
The roof leaked.
Dinosaurs died out a long time ago.
Tom is a good swimmer.
There are nine planets in the Sun.
The main problem with the Swedish animation industry is that there is no Swedish animation industry.
I'll do it for you.
Talk to me?
I rarely walk to work.
I hate liars.
Tom is a man of no means.
You're Japanese?
Can you please open the window?
It's 4:15 in the morning.
I have twins.
I don't remember making any money from that job.
I love her little sister so much.
Tom was a brave man.

A fat white cat sat on the wall and stared at him with tired eyes.
Tom got fired.
Why are you so angry?
I'm pleased.
Tom and Mary are the same height.
Continue
Find something?
Don't waste your time on the little things.
I'm going to go.
Doesn't it hurt a lot?
Can you pass me the salt?
Call me when you've got the preparations.
I gave him the book.
I love you more than anything.
I'm thirsty for this.
If I drink coffee, I can't sleep.
How could I sleep on a bomb when I went to bed early?
Tom's illness was caused by overeating.
No one in their right mind would even consider doing such a stupid thing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You'll get cold if you don't get dressed.
This size is too big for me.
You never know what's gonna happen in the future.
Long live and prosper.
I found the picture Tom was looking for.
Where are we?
I'm going to buy my son a watch.
I ate dinner late last night.
Yeah, that's right.
He told his little brother the story.
I'm a tennis player.
Nire phone number is 9876-5432.
I hate my job.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He made a mistake.
That's none of your business.
I wanna go to school.
Excuse me, this is my place.
Tom and Mary don't like me.
There's no language as beautiful as Portuguese.
Tom has a bad reputation.
He's very kind.
You love me?
Who do you live with?
I thought this was easy to do, but I've been working all day and I'm still not ready.
Tom didn't know how to express himself.
Which side is on the line?
It has nothing to do with him.
As soon as I have more details, I'll contact you again.
Get up!
I can't keep track of how many signatures I've had to print this week.
Tom doesn't know anything about computer programming.
I rarely walk to work.
I like to go for a walk.
What did you get?
How many little sisters do you have?
A young woman sang and played guitar in front of the fountain.
Of course you are!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Kati made apple pie.
I have to go now.
When did you buy that hat?
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
If you've just eaten, you shouldn't go swimming.
Tom is a tough guy to handle.
Do you like to dance?
I don't like this.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Though they were tired, they did not stop working.
Don't you wanna come see us next week?
If I'd known I was going to be photographed, I'd have dressed better.
Tom laughed violently.
Your father is tall.
Kati has the flu.
This is stupid.
The President appealed to every citizen to save energy.
Where are you going?
I'd like to send a postal package to Japan.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Please take off your socks.
This bike is mine.
I'm sorry, I was just making the wrong conclusions again.
Like it or not, you gotta do it.
He ordered a barbecue.
I'm going to school.
I can't find a good translation either.
He grew up.
We trust you.
He's a very kind person.
It's really cold today.
Is it true?
It's easy.
Amy wants something new to wear.

I like American football.
So what's the test?
Bus stop 7?
What are they made of?
Do you mind if I turn on the TV?

I've decided to resign at the end of this month.
Tom seems rather happy.
I cheered myself listening to music.
Do you want some more toast?
Have you got a fire?
I don't want to go out now.
I wish the weekend would come soon.
That's why I hate him.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Christmas is in two weeks.
Be proud of yourself.
Don't leave the TV on!
You're acting like an idiot.
Can I just leave for a moment?
Where do you live?I live in Tokyo.
Why isn't the bus coming?

I hate borrowing money and borrowing money.
Can I pay you, please?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I ask you something?
Marie has no idea what she should say to her.
I'm getting a lot of eyelashes.
I think this tie fits the dress.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
What's the matter?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom, come in here.
Do they all have a lead?
I want you to behave when we're at the dining table.
I meant it as a joke.
I value your friendship.
I was just too small to get under the car.
Can I come with you?
I have four souls in my family.
I get along very well with my aunt.
How many people have you told about it?
I knew who he was the moment we met.
Why did you lie?
I can't decide whether to buy these 3990 yen shoes or not.
Oh, I'm starting to cry.
That's weird.
Green Party is fighting nuclear power.
These scratched spots are delicious.
I mean, first straight, then right, then what?
I eat breakfast every morning.
Why is snow white?
I have a fever.
Tom has food allergies, so he needs to pay attention to what he eats.

Tom shouted his whole lung.
Tom caught a real big bump.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He was in critical condition.
I don't worry about it.
Oh, my God!
I didn't know what to say to her.
Easy trick!
I don't know when Roope arrived in Japan.
He was a little nervous by nature when he was surrounded by a lot of people.
This is the cutest baby I've ever seen.

I'm weakening myself.
I'm sorry I can't make you happy.
Oh, my God!
Tom's comment is over.
Tom cannot remember exactly what he had to do.
It's so hot, so hot, you can fry eggs on a car's machine.
His wife was away from home, so he made his own dinner.
What would I do with it today?
Can you clean the table?
Can we go tomorrow at 9:00?
Get back there!
He had a good idea at the last minute.
Remember where she was born?
What kind of eggs do you want?
Auto almost hit me.
Tom likes Mary, but Mary likes Jon. To make things even more interesting, Joni likes Lisa, but Lisa likes Tom.
He looked at the stranger with suspicion.
Marines brown eyes are beautiful.
How long are you?

When writing a sentence, it is usually started with a capital letter and ends with the point (.), the exclamation mark (!) or the question mark (?).
Can you pass me the salt, please?
You know he has a girlfriend?
Tom was very happy.
Who stole the apple?
Tom, get up!
️Baseball is fun.
Tom cried all night.
Can you stay and talk for a second before the others leave?
I'm going outside.
I'm sorry, I was wrong.
A dragon is an imaginary creature.
I wish I'd brought some eye drops.
We have to go.
He's divorced from her.
I was in Tokyo yesterday.
"Are you looking for something?""No, I'm just looking".
Ten years since my father died.
Tom is a lazy man.
They pointed me to a new room.
The boy was silent.
He's all right.
I want you to behave when we're at the dining table.
Tom, I love you!
Thank you for your help.
You should have called me.
Tom never quit smoking.
Where's the info?
How was your day today?
Always smile.
Oh, my God, honey.
Tom jumped into the lake.
I decided to ask Tom.
Put your coat on.
Tom has poor eyesight.
It's your call.
How many hours do you usually get up?
Tom ran on all foots.

Can I borrow your bag?
He's a total asshole.
I'm from Switzerland.
Suddenly there was a fire in that department store.
Can I have a bill?
What's your dad's job?
I've got the bad flu.
I really appreciate your kindness.
Excuse me!
Get on with it!
That's weird.
That's right.
How old are you?
Of course, he's not guilty.
Excuse me, do you know where the exit is?
Can you turn on the radio?
Tom is afraid of dogs.
Where the hell did Tom go?
Wright speaks Japanese as if he were a native Japanese.
Please forgive me.
What do locks eat?
Don't be so hard on me, please.
"You spoke well!""Are you sure?"Thank you!"
You wanna hear my grief?
Follow you!
I'm alone.
When I removed the toilet, the water flowed, plunging down the sewer.
I wanna give her a birthday present.
He works in the factory.
I have a fever.
I like romance novels.
I'll call him again.
Thank you for coming.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

He doesn't understand the importance of this meeting.
Just a minute.
You're not even a student here.
What are you looking at?
He stressed the importance of education.
Don't worry about it.
Where is Japan Airlines' service block?
I'm leaving in an hour.
There was no crucifix as far as the eye could see.
Who do you live with?
Tom only speaks French.
Can I change the channel?
Do you have a visa?
I'm glad I'm not the one paying.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Why don't you call Tom?
He's a genius.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The grass is greener on the other side of the fence.
You can trust him, he will never let you down.
It's a tough air to beat.
Kristian can't work tomorrow.
You don't have to apologize, Tom.
Calm down now.
If you know a good way to get a break from having a girlfriend, tell me.
We have to leave now.
A friend of mine is looking for someone who can speak French.
Tom has a low voice.
I don't have time to explain.
I thought, did you find the umbrella you said you destroyed some time ago?
Mozart's life was very short.
He went the wrong way and got lost in the middle of the woods.
Thank you for this day.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm drunk with this.
Who is he?
Suddenly, she got a great inspiration.
This is the best way.
That's weird.
He got on that bus.
I was glad he adopted Japanese very quickly.
What's my fault?
I'm for a German spelling reform.
I know.
Tom said he had never eaten such a delicious meal before.
Let's see!
I'm sorry about that.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It was a joke.
A long time ago!

The lake is deep here.
Ten years is a remarkable time.
I should have listened to my mother.
I feel everywhere.
What's bothering you?
Who painted this painting?
Wait a minute before you call.
A small stream will grow into a big river.
Tom, can you come tomorrow?
Tom is stylish.
If I drink coffee, I can't sleep.
There's a dog under the table.
I'm almost finished.
The shop was full of young people.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is the last thing I want to do.
I'm looking forward to it.

I'm going to need something sweet.
This is the worst movie ever made.
Tom has done nothing wrong.
I walk to school in half an hour.
Tom brushes his teeth.
We couldn't help but leave it to her to handle.
Come on, hurry up!
Everything is ready.
Stay in the room.
You'll understand soon enough.
I don't know.
When I come to this park, I remember my childhood.
Be careful driving.
Tom turned his pocket around and spread the contents around.
He denied that John had helped the lost little boy.
Be quiet when I'm talking.
That's fun.
You're still young.
This bike is mine.
I told you to stop exaggerating a million times.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can you please just keep it down?
Why do they call this bird English?
His students speak evil behind his back.
This is none of my business.
Tom liked to sing, but nobody wanted to hear Tom sing.
The best speaker!
I'll be back by 7:30.
Drive carefully.
I'm not tired.
My little sister's hobby is designing images for use on the Internet, and when she has time off, she shares pictures for free on her own websites.
We climbed the top of Mount Fuji.
I'd like to go to France sometime.
What's it for?
Tom hurt himself.

He left.
Tom is good at telling jokes.
I wish summer would come soon.
You know where she lives?
You know the name of that guy, right?
I write my mother once a month.
He couldn't keep his laughter down.
Help me!
You can talk as much as you like.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Where are you from anyway?
You're keeping this confidential.
Who else can't get in?
I mean, it's been a while since we've met.
Tom worked here for how many years?
It's hot today.
Do you know how to use a computer?
This is my daughter.
I threw my shoes.
We've seen it before.
I'll be at the station around 1:35.
You want me to help?
️Please have a cake.
I'm worried about my weight.
I've been really busy lately.
I live in Boston.
He was desperate to tell someone a secret.
Good eating habits before you start eating.
They played video games.
What a beautiful sunset.
I'll call you later, okay?
Tom can sing some French songs.
How much is this camera?
I'm sorry, but I don't speak English very well.
Even if you don't want to, you have to.
I found the lyrics, but I can't copy and paste them here.
I'm sorry I can't encourage you very well.
Can you lend me your dictionary?
Tom has no one to ask for advice.
They paid separately.
Have you prepared for tomorrow?
In this forest you may see savages.
I like football.
Seems like it's coming.
You've been answering slowly lately.
Tom should be here by midday.
He may not succeed.
I'm really tired of the hard work.
I don't have Latin lat.
I like love stories.
Cat's eyes are very light sensitive.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He admits he knows a secret.
Can I introduce myself?
I'm totally pissed off.
I have no intention of spending ten dollars.
Tom is dying.
Tom does not smile.
I already ate lunch.
Tom is reading a book right now.
My brother can run really fast.
I'm giving up.
I'm totally pissed off.
Can I get another cup of tea?
I don't like being asked to shop.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It was really hard.
You left your clothes on the floor again!
I got a lot of mail this morning.
"Why aren't the lights on?""Well, I just couldn't".
Time to act.


What's your favorite TV show?
You know the name of that guy, right?
What I admire most about her is her innocence.
I rarely walk to work.
He's causing us a lot of trouble, but I like him anyway.
He lives in the house over there.
Tom speaks English with a strong French accent.
Now it's too late to apologize.
The sheep is full of water today.
I bought him a new car.
Tom couldn't remember where he was that night.
What are you reading?
I've had enough of the last time!
Come home now.
I almost got hit by a car.
Who is this man?
Where do you live now?
Have you eaten Turkish food?
How was the weekend?
I think there's a storm coming.
What are the differences between religion and philosophy?
Tom has a loud voice.
Nobody else but her came to the party.
I'm off on Sunday.
Can I have a glass of water?
Ask Tom.
Theory and practice may not always meet.
Both of these kids were the same age.
He asked me if I knew Tom's address.
Tell me what?
Get ready!
How much do you like Tom?
Doesn't anyone here speak Japanese?
I hate Tom.
I've been very busy all week.
I'm sorry to bother you.
You know you like to travel, Tom.
Have you any questions?
Tom was tampering with the report.
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
I'm hurting my legs.
What is that?
Stop being so stupid!
If you don't know the answer, guess.
Can you turn it down?
Marko is my friend, he likes dogs a lot.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
I should have taken a travel medicine.
Can you do it?
Why is nothing else so easily broken as beautiful things?
There's no other way.
Tom seemed to be crying.
Have you made sure the door is locked?
I was just in the bathroom when the phone rang.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I found a very beautiful place today.
I moved last month.
Nothing.
Red suit suits him well.
Let me go.
He died.
Where is he going?
If you don't try, you'll hardly ever know.

What's your dad's job?
What time is it in Boston?
Thank you for your hard work.
Tom called Mary to apologize, but Mary knocked him in the ear.
He was once a man of few words.
Don't throw a towel around.
I just pulled money from the bank today, so I only have 10,000 yen notes.
Turn off the lights.
What was Tom's last name again?
There's hardly any coffee left in the pan.
Tom told Maril to go to the neighborhood and see if they needed help.
Can you introduce yourself to me briefly?
As soon as I can afford it, I'm gonna buy a new car.
Tom is a hard worker.
So, see you later!
I'm looking for a present for my wife.
Looks like it's raining.
They sat there, so there was always one chair left.
I'm totally broke.
Pink leaves are really fragile.
️Baseball is fun.
I wanna go with you, but I'm totally penniless.
You have cancer.
If you go to the woods, watch out for the cannibal monsters!
Can you speak a little bit of a little bit?
I'm not saying it's impossible.
He can count to 10 with his fingers.

Can you advise me to the station?
How many students are there?
They're eating.
Nice to meet you.

I taught myself how to play guitar.
Sometimes my ear gets rumors about him.
He made her a bookshelf.
Tom worked here for how many years?
Thank God I can use a very good library.
Can I pay with a credit card?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Can we meet tonight?
He just became principal.
Come in one at a time.
Tom turned on the heater.
Let's stay with him.
I have some English books.
Tom was the only one who saw Mary sneaking into the room.
Where have you been?
Get out of here!
I'm starting to think it's time to go.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He got lost in the world of comics.
Which one would you rather fuck, Tom or Jon?
How much money do you have with you now?
Are the drinks free?Only for women.
That's exactly what he's up to.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I haven't found the perfect husband yet.
Can you break a dollar down?
There's a magical atmosphere here.
Can you still eat yogurt when it's the best one month since the date?
Don't interrupt me.
Joni can't play guitar.
Tom suddenly laughed.
Here are some creative sketches. Take it if you're happy.
Looks like it's going to rain.
20€.Somehow expensive.If you keep the price down, it might drop a little bit.
It's none of his business.
It's an easy trick.
I can't put that much money into it.
Do you think that there can be no friendship between men and women?
Tom is good with numbers.
When making a dress, you need to take precise measurements.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I thought Jean was playing tennis with my older brother.
You found the umbrella you said you lost a couple of days ago?
I wanna go abroad.

I didn't order the fish.
You think he did his job alone?
Can you do the laundry?
The CEO is a foot-on-the-ground type.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Can anyone miss tomorrow?
(Please and) clean the table.
Sally gave him a Christmas present.
This is the cheapest shop in town.
Can you fix that?
You're not?
When you turn left, you see a white building.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
See you later!
He was about to drown, but his father saved him!
I learned it from the outside.
Where's your dog?
What's mine?
How many kids do you have?
I counted on him to help me.
I wish Tom had stayed longer, but he had to leave.
I wish you'd come to those parties last night.
I don't wanna hear your complaint anymore.
Stop saying things about Tom!
Tom seems to be asleep.
The boy took no risk from his father's advice.
I've got a headache.
Can I hold your hand?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I heard there were jet footprints in the Himalayas.
Give me a break.

Tom is in the lower class in the same high school as me.
Tom is looking at me.
I met Tom a few minutes ago.
Get in the car!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
If you don't do it, nobody will.
He's having a party next week.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I don't know.
I want a coffee mug.
If you make your own clothes, you'll save a lot of money.
Kick!
I have one cat and one dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
The cake is Kat's.
I like Tom because he's honest.
Come with me.
His hands were so fucked up.
Which do you like, white wine or red wine?
I arrived at the station at 6:00.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't you miss it?

Can you give me some advice on how to get to the beach?
I had a bad feeling.
I hardly ever go to church.
I'm gonna be late for work.

Baby, please don't cry.
This size is too big for me.
You look stupid.
I'd like to ask Tom to answer some of my questions.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Long live the king!
He was looking at the young man.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Never too late to learn.
Tom plans to throw a surprise party next Saturday for Mary's birthday.
This is a very rare example.
He read the paper.
How old are you?
Tom looks pale.
Tom will go to Boston next year.
What's in it?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
They got caught stealing apples.
This is different from what I ordered.
Tom is a neurologist.
I wanna watch TV.
I'm taking a few days off.
Tom asked a stupid question.
Tom, don't bother me.
I'm fine with that.
He's smart.
Can you turn off the lights?
How much is this hat?
She has ten children.
Can you close the door?
Can you help us tomorrow morning?
Excuse me, but can I borrow your phone?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I miss you, Tom.
Mari can swim.
I think we're going to the baseball game tomorrow.
Can you use the sciences?
What are you snoring about?
Can you fix this?
Why are you standing in line?
Tom won?
They invited me to play cards.
️Don't ride a bike on the sidewalk.
Remove your hat, please.
Generally, boys are faster than girls.
Stop playing games at Tom's expense.
Get here at exactly 6:00.
Can you hold on a second?
How old are you?
Tom's mind has improved considerably.
You lived here before?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You can't give up.
I'll bring my big sister with me next time.
Close your book.
This is the best way to do it.
He drew a picture in his notebook.
I'm fat? I'm fat? I'm fat. I'm not fat.
Of course you are!
I'm not really going to pay $10
Theory and practice never meet.
I'll be there soon.
Papa slept through the whole movie.
️Don't touch them.
I've got shampoo in my eyes and it's stinging.
I don't know.
Tom thinks it's impossible for Mary to break the record.
They have 12 children.
Tom said he wanted to be alone and then he went to his own room.
That's fascinating.
When I grow up, I'm gonna marry Tom.
Tom sat on the floor.
Isn't that cool?
I didn't hear you coming in.

I just moved in, so my room still looks like a bear.
Can I join the game?

I slept well last night.
Wait a minute.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is notorious.
Can Tom still drive?
Tom is cool.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That's a good idea!
How should I eat this?
I'm gonna need a place to stay for the night.
I need Tom.
I don't know why the meeting was postponed.
Get ahead.
Let's just calm down.
There's no place like home.
The match was called off due to rain.
How long does it take to walk from home to here?
Is there anything else you want me to do?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Sounds pretty tempting.
I drank the juice right after I bathed.
Can you close the door?
Take as many peaches as you want.
Tom has the right to vote.
Tom only speaks French.
He translated the book from French into English.
The older it gets, the worse the memory gets.
That's right.
I have a red bike
Get up!
He can't swim.
Do well and wait.
I can't decide whether or not to go.
Are you a familiar?
My big brother is two years older than me.
This is my only camera.
When is your book coming out?
Stay calm.
I'll call you back later.

London's air quality was not exactly the best thing to say.

Don't go outside after dark.
I like this skirt. Can I arrange this?

Can I have a pillow, please?
Tom got off the train.
He always walks lightly.
Why does he always fall asleep when he starts studying?
I went to bed early.
Tom grabbed Mary's arm and started to pull her towards the door.
I rarely walk to work.
Tom grew up in a small village.
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike doesn't practice basketball on Mondays.
Trang's party was as fun as the dead man's vigil.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'll admit that your plan makes sense, but it still sounds very difficult to implement.
We need to talk about what we should do.
When Tom gave the bitch to Mary, she ran out of the room.
Don't you worry?
He let go of the rope.
Tom was very happy.
I mean, it's been a while since we've met.
Can you hold on a sec?
Tom loses his mind.
Trains run more often than buses.
Tom seemed busy?
They admired the beautiful scenery on top of the mountain.
Why don't you go to bed now, because tomorrow is early.
If for some reason I failed, my parents would be extremely disappointed.
You sleep a lot!
Why didn't you come? I had no choice.
Have you got plans for tomorrow?
Come home now.
When I finished my homework, I was talking about these with my mom.
I'm from Switzerland.
Unfortunately, the report is true.
Steal money.
Have fun!
It was made by hand.
If you find a mistake, leave a comment.

I can't wait any longer.
I'm from Australia.

I still think about him sometimes.
If you're free, help me out.
I'll take care of the bill.
I met a friend I met online for the first time yesterday.Oh, the Tom type you always talk about?Just that.Well, who was it for?Not as good looking as I expected.
The lake is deep here.
Can you answer that question?
I'm tired of this.
Happy birthday to you, Miss Aiba!
This is good.
What is the difference between religion and philosophy?
People love freedom.
Can I ask you your name?
The singer has a beautiful voice.
Tom cried.
Tom was drunk.
What's it for?
I don't have a penny.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Who do you think wins?
It's cold!

Can you show me something else?
He always asks silly questions.
Over 20 people were already sitting there.

You must obey your parents.
You've heard this song before?
Tom is a good hot guy.
Tom's eyesight is getting worse all the time.
I have to go now.
We must always act in accordance with the law.
What's the minimum wage in Australia?
See you later!
I saw a white dog jumping over the fence.
I hear Tom's voice.
Are you ready to welcome 2012?
Please sit down.
I'm gonna have a cold drink.
How about a walk after lunch?
Where are you?
He liked taking care of the kids.
- Oh, yeah?
My dog is smaller than yours.
I'm not.
I like her a lot.
I don't want you to return the book I lent you for a while.
I came last night.
I'm Chinese.
Who do you think you are when you talk to me in a chair?
I don't seem to have any luck today.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The wind is down.
I went to bed early.
Why did you quit your blog?
Someone's crazy now. I don't think it was meant to be.
I rushed out right after breakfast.
What kind of egg do you want?
What are you doing?
Keep in touch.
I'll need it by tomorrow.
I live with my uncle.
Come with us.
What's in that cupboard?
You're bleeding your head.
Can you turn the radio down?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Why did you buy flowers?

Dogs' eyesight declines with age, just like humans do.
Have you ever been so restless since this morning?
Are all travel arrangements ready?
That's my favorite song.
This is our friend Tom.
Do we have class this Friday?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I can't imagine living without him.
You must use your time wisely.
I washed my hands of the whole thing.
You shouldn't despise him just because his arm is bad.
Papa keeps a diary every day.
I don't like this.
The pain was unbearable.
I should have kept my mouth shut.
What do you think?
The date of return of the report is approaching, so I am in a complete unimaginable hurry.
Tom doesn't have children.
Can you drive me to the station?
The wind stopped.
I'm totally broke.
He didn't show up for the last meeting.
Always fun to meet you.
I'm full of English.
He likes her.
When you talk about war, they're just as brave as anyone.
Sami is two years younger than Tom.
I went to see the cherry blossom.
I can't get in touch with Tom.
Sit down and wait until your name is called.
He has blond hair.
I want to speak English fluently.
They said he killed that woman.
Why do they call this bird English?
He's an unusually conversational person.
Can you wake me up at 7:00?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom sleeps on his back.
You need to calm down and start studying.
The bag of Mrs. Baker was stolen.
I'm ready for anything for you.
What are you doing in such a dark place?
My father doesn't drink or smoke.
Tom is in the shower.
A great idea!
Can you write it down for me?
Thank you for inviting me.
I'm a student at the university.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He must be mad at me.
The baby in the chest is so cute.
They walked hand in hand.
Tom scraped all the papers together.
I started crying.
I've learned everything in human life about the most important lack.
Tom, how many bites can you pull?
Can I have the bill, please?
The party lasted three hours.
Can you hold on a second?
Don't let that happen again.
That's a mistake. I'm sorry.
He took off his jacket.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He wiped his face with a nail polish.
Don't get involved in other people's business.

Ah, yeah.
What happened to Tom?
I told you the truth.
Have a nice trip!

"Tom is there now?""Yes. Do you want it on your phone?""Yes, thank you"."Okay, wait a minute."Tom, Mary wants to talk to you"."
How old are you?
I'm taking a couple of days off.
If it looks like an apple and tastes like an apple, it's pretty sure it's an apple.
Use mine for now.

Can you show me something else?
Tennis is very interesting.

Tom is older than me.
I think Tom ought to eat more.
He's a little pissed off.
Never too old to learn.
Stop talking now.
He was red in his shame.
The guy who keeps asking his parents for money.
The twins are like mirrors of each other and it's almost impossible to tell who's who.
Whatever he says, I won't trust him again.
Please let me stay.
But there's a big dog.
The previous hostess was always smiling, but the new one seems to be a very shy person.
He made a mistake.
I don't speak French at all.
Nice to meet you again.
That's a good idea!
You're going to take the entrance exam?
I'm in the same high school as Tom.
Tom is handsome.
When I look at Tom, someone comes to mind.Who is that person?It doesn't come to mind.
I'm looking for a present for my mom.

Stay in the village when you get home.
Try again.
Don't say anything!
I suggest we plant more trees along the road.
Thank you so much for coming.
You keep this a secret.
When I saw Tom, I felt that he was worried a lot, so I let him be quiet for a while.
Beware of thieves here.
What's in the desk box?
He ate the whole meal with his shower.
How did you know I was Canadian?

Slow down!
I think that's a good idea.
Car is in the garage.
I wish I was born Canadian.
He's still trying to figure out how to handle that problem.
Turn on the TV.
I think it's exactly what you're saying.
Tom scares you?
Get some exercise outside.
Can you wait till tomorrow morning?
We'd better leave him alone for a moment.
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
You need to calm down and start studying.
You ever heard of the Loch Ness monster?
You're being serious?
Let's ask him.
Tom admitted to stealing a bicycle.
When he heard this, he fainted.
So what?
I keep a diary every day.
Next time, I'm gonna take my little sister with me.
Get some rest.
I refuse to do so.
Your activities are entirely legal.
Merci beaucoup means "Merci beaucoup" in French.
A friend of mine left for the US.
Now shut up!
I'm free.
Come on, hurry up.
Do you speak French?
What's the matter? You've been so restless since this morning. I feel like you're here physically, but not mentally.
He can't be hungry. He just ate lunch.
You lied to Tom.
Let's go!
He's a doctor.
Have a great weekend!
Tom is afraid of heights.
Excuse me, where's the exit?
Don't walk that fast.
Can I have the bill, please?
How were you when you were 15?
I'm being fair.
Tom looked around the room.
He's already studying when you wake up.
What is the name of this song? I've heard this, but I don't remember the name.
What's your big sister doing now?
Aija, stop it!
Can you break an egg with one hand?
I can't answer that better.
Tom had never seen a girl as beautiful as Mary before.

There's no other baseball player who'd be as much worshiped as this man.
He told her not to spend time with bad people.
What do you like to do on Sundays?
It's cold, I wanna go to winter.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You think I should throw this away?
Have you finished reading that book?
Don't leave things to fate.
I'm from Australia.
It's tomorrow!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm already a slut.
What would you do?
I'm sorry to bother you.
Be careful what you step on.
I don't think Tom would be interested in buying your old MP3 player.
I've got a lot to do today.
If you'd known I was a man, wouldn't you have started talking to me?

Excuse me, could you ask the passenger in the front row to lift the back of his seat?
Get up!
You don't like to say that.
What a relief!
You have to apologize to your father for not coming home by dinner.
Tom is a selfless person.
I hope you're well soon.
He decorated his dress with flowers.
What are you going to tell Tom?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
So you're saying Tom is a liar?
Coffee is not enough.
I already got coffee.
Get everyone on board!
Tom fell into the pool.
I'm sorry to object.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Every time I see a picture of my dead mother, I feel a piece in my throat.
I got it!
How does a giraffe sound?
You still hungry?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm taking them to Kate's.
I have to catch the 8:15 train to Paris.
Can you bring us the bill?
How long were you in Caracas?
Take off your shoes.
Have you ever had a serious illness?
Excessive exercise is more harmful to health than good.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Will he be back soon? I think so.
Tom fell.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Tony.
They waited for him for hours.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't look down on others.
I changed my address last month.
Have you found the umbrella you said you destroyed a few days ago?
I'll call you when I've finished shopping.
Tom ran full speed.
What's the matter?
Where does that confidence come from?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Suddenly they stopped talking.
When Tom grabs a microphone, his whole personality changes.
Do you want me to go buy some ice cream?
I didn't know the product.
Who is the one you want to talk to?
Moro!
You're exaggerating now!
How old do you think Tom is?
That's exactly what he said.
Tom is my cousin.
Get ahead.
Tom spoke to Mary yesterday.
Come with us.
He looked at her face.
If Tom goes, then I won't go.
Can you turn on the lights?
You can eat as much as you want.
Who's your favorite author?
Tom raised the mustache.
Can you come tomorrow night?
This is the thing we want to know.
No, thank you. That's enough.
He's in the kitchen.
I'm tired of it!
We just got a visitor. Can you hold on a second?
I couldn't hold back my tears.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I hate jealous women.
He was trying to get the sheep.
Keep in touch with me.
Tom wiped his face with a nail polish.
I don't have a penny.
What is this?
Why me?
Let me see.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I ask you your name?
You dropped something.
He's a man to trust.
Tom, get the wood.
You should prepare for the worst.
Can I have some water, please?
What are you thinking?

John is an American boy.
Can I take your hand?
Don't waste your time on the little things.
Can you give him this document
Tom visits Boston from time to time.
Tom cut his corners.
I'm getting hurt when I'm getting my toes cut off.
Tom's proposal is worth considering.
Have you ever been to a rave?
Tom understands French.
I want to meet Tom.
There was no bathtub.
Let me show you the car I just bought.
I should have worn a short-haired shirt.
Get me the paper.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I've been eating cupcakes for the night.
Have you a reason why you're always late for school?
Mama bought my little brother a yellow umbrella.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Car was running 40 miles an hour.
You free this afternoon?
Tom is a modest young man.
How much do you have with you?Sorry, I don't have a wallet.
It's too expensive!
It's easy to see that he's rich.
Tom's face changed colour.
I won!
Can I have a cup of coffee, please?
Excuse me, could you pass me some salt and pepper?
A lot of soldiers were killed here.
The two men sitting on the bench were American.
I'm having a pain in my eyes.
Sit down, please.
A little fun.
Even if you don't have an appetite, you'll have to eat something or you won't last till lunch.
He majored in theater at the university.
The food's gone cold.
He ran.
When I was young, I had to work hard.
What did he buy from that store?
I couldn't help but stare at the text in the book.
I was in the bathroom when the phone rang.
What exactly was the message you sent me the other day?
Thank you for explaining.
Tom is a professional baseball player.
I had a good time.
They drove to the station.
I'm glad your flu's healed.
I'll call you back later.
Tom's hands were covered in mud.
I'm sorry, I forgot about that.
I'm young.
Tom was most afraid of all that he might not be able to walk anymore.
Where are you going?
How much is this?
I asked them to send another ticket.
I'm wrong.
All for the day.
The entire nation is engaged in the fight against poverty.
I'm planning on going to Europe next week.
You ready?
I hear I like this old car more than I like the new one.
He couldn't be called fat, but he was a roach.
So you don't have a cough?
Tom was teasing Mary.
He's a purple.
Tom retired at 65.
I wish I'd kept dancing.
I knew I had broken my wrist the moment I fell.
I go to church every day.
I'm already on the 26th.
Give me permission to go home.
Tom has a tendency to exaggerate.
I like to eat seafood.
Tom yelled loudly as he left his lungs.
Can you get another cup of tea?
When you turn left, you'll see a white building.
Heavy rain prevented us from going fishing.
Can I have a cup of tea?
He's a nice person.
He's in a meeting now.
The important thing is not to win, but to participate.
He must be mad.
Tell me what you want.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a great weekend.
The baby can't walk yet.
Do you know where she is?
The sun is the eternal source of light, heat and life.
I'm sorry I accidentally opened the letter addressed to you.
I'm not a kid anymore.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Everybody likes big pizzas.
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.
How old do I look?
Oh, my God!
Tom broke up with Mary.
I'm so bored!
How can you explain things so understandably?
Are they coming too?
I thought it was close.
I'm a student at the University of Hyogo.
Get home.
Can I have a map of the city, please?
I don't have a job, so I can't put money in the savings.
Tom was home.
Get back in your seat.
He wrote his own letters on white nails.
Tom knows a lot about Mary.
I just met an old friend.
I'm not saying it was cold last night, but it was cool.
Have a great weekend.
Can I change the channel?No, just change it.
I'm sad.
Look at that painting.
Can you turn it down?
Her mother looks like her older sister.
Mari, don't you think you should stop losing weight?
You wouldn't happen to be afraid of me, would you?
Excuse me for interrupting.
Tom seems like a smart boy to me.
Mama made me a wooden fence.
The fabric was bright red.
If you don't want to go, then you don't have to.

I don't want to go out now.
I just finished my breakfast.
This has nothing to do with me.
What do you do in your free time?
He's not a sharp-headed man, and he's not blessed with intelligence.
Keep your room in as good a place as you can.
I look forward to meeting you soon.
I'm on very good terms with my aunt.
Come home now.
Don't move if I don't tell you to.
I have a lot of things to do by tomorrow.
I've never eaten mango before.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We'd be happy to accept your proposal.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That's it?
Tom is not good at sports.
I don't know what kind of plan Tom's working on.
I woke up a moment ago.
Look at this.
It was a total heap to me.
Get Mary to wake up.
I got a mat in the corn.
Tom came to Japan from Australia.
Wait, what did you just say?
Ville is two years older than me.
Now stop all that gossip.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Can I introduce myself?
Hey, Tom.
Why are you so quiet?
How long will this cold weather last?
The villagers went to find the missing child.
He bought a new apartment a few days ago.
Tom is thirty.
What's your name?
Where are you going?
At the time, music was everything to us.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can you talk to me on Skype tonight?
I couldn't have done it without you.
I like chocolate.
In case of fire, call 112.
Tom is in a bad mood.
Marco.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I eat dinner between 7:00 and 8:00.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
A moment.
He's my little brother.
Help me up.
How did you know about the news?
Joni was lazy before she met you.
He picked up the old letters.
Tom was asleep.
Tom waited for Mary for a long time.
I'm 19 years old.
Stop playing with your hat.
I don't like this.
Will you attend the afternoon meeting?
I walked my leg broke.
I like tennis.
I'm just watching.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is a slow book reader.
I'd like a 80 yen stamp, please.
I'm trying to.
What's your home?
I'd like you to return the book I lent you the other day.
Where's my car?
I'm gonna have to start walking.
Tom speaks English with a French accent.
I'm walking to school in ten minutes.
Tom yelled loudly as he left his lungs.
Dinner is bad for your health.
I want to believe.
This is our friend Tom.
"Can I heat the cookie?" "Yes, thank you".
I want to read books about the Beatles.
I want you to behave yourself when you eat.
Too bad he can't make it.
For the uninitiated, eating the first bonity of the year was so important that they even borrowed it.
Tom speaks French quite well.
Is that so?
I'm interested in making my own homepage.
What have you been doing?
You made a wise choice.
What do you think?
When and where did you meet her?
Do I have to do it now?
I'll pay you.
He hurt his hand when he fell.
Don't look at me like that.
Talk is silver, but silence is gold.
I'm sorry I went to wake you.
What was Tom's last name again?
Tom can do that.
I'd have drowned if you hadn't come to my aid.
How about another glass of wine?
I don't know if I can or not, but at least I'm trying.
I'm on top of it.
Need a ride?
Tom is coming soon.
It's strange that he came home so late last night.
How long have you been here?
Tom read it out loud.
I think this movie is really interesting.
Welcome to our home.
Tom is not interested.
He's got a lot of money.
The best way to learn a foreign language is to go live in a country where it is spoken.
They're all looking for a missing child.
I keep a diary every day.
Late watch is bad for the skin.
Tom sipped a chicken.
How much do I have to pay?
He came to see us yesterday.
Call me Ishmael.
What should Tom say to ask Mary for forgiveness?
He was so tired, he couldn't even read the evening paper.
I'm tired of it!
Show me the list.
If you want a new bike, you'd better start saving money.
Tom always brings rain with him.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Where are you going?
He lost his possessions, his family, his friends.
Stop starving Tom.
If it looks like an apple and tastes like an apple, it's probably an apple.
Get out of here!

Tom is in the public eye.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I saw her.
Do you know where Tom is?
I'm gonna be home all day tomorrow.
Come on, please.
How many apples do you want?
I speak Japanese generally.
I'll explain it with a photo.
What the hell are your earrings for?
How old is your dad?
Can you tell me how to get to the beach?
It's perfect.
He's very kind.
When the phone rang, I was in the bathroom.
He's unusually attractive.
My son was second last in the painting.
I have no idea what he's up to.
Form a circle and hold each other's hands.
All men are equal.
Tom has been crying all night.
They paid close attention to what he said.
Have fun!
I have a red bicycle.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's a nice person.
I can't speak French at all.
You can't have both.
The train is leaving!
I wish I'd listened to your warnings.
He cried.
John drinks too much these days.
Long time!
I'd rather be home than go out in this weather.
We all did fine.
Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.
Can I borrow your pencil?
We're home!
I still need to get the camera fixed.
When he looked her in the eye, he left suddenly.
I couldn't help but cry.
Why did he do that?
They were amazed at the beautiful scenery of the hill.
I got fired, but since I have a little savings, I don't have any problems with living expenses yet.
If I am born again, I want to be a cat.
The enemy of the enemy is not necessarily an ally.
Have a great weekend!
Tom returned home from Australia.
I have no idea who he is.
Don't let this chance go!
Don't worry about it.
I wanna travel alone.
Don't touch me!
He's not much of a beggar.
See you later.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What time is it now?

He was a good singer.
They waited for him for hours.
Tom is probably fine.
I found the lyrics, but I can't copy them.
Everybody makes mistakes.
You shouldn't take what Tom says seriously.
You mind if we leave a little earlier?
But is it Tom?  Mary, for a long time! Three years since the last time?  That's how much of it is.
I think it's dangerous to climb a mountain on a stormy day.
We asked him to come back.
Tom's condition is bad.
Who is Tom?
Tom confessed to stealing a bicycle.
Thanks for everything, Mom!
I'm sorry to bother you.
Marie is the most beautiful girl in her class.
Are all travel arrangements ready?
Why do you love me?
Never heard of one.
Can you turn it down?
I'm getting hurt all over the place.
I have to buy a new rug for this room.
So sad?
I turned off the radio.
That's interesting.
Please take off your socks.
Who is this man?
I live in Boston.
Although I studied English for six years in school, I don't speak it well.
So we can meet again here sometime.
He's sick.
You're keeping this a secret.
I'm just going out.
Don't try to do two things at once.
Once upon a time, long, long ago, in a place, there was an old man and his wife.
Tom put his flower on the desk.
Tom, you liar!
Let's be friends for ever.
Have you got a credit card?
Can you fix my faulty tire?
, I'd like an orange juice, please, Mike said.
There's nothing useless about me in life.
"Why are you angry?" "I'm not angry!"
I'm late for school.
Tom has been studying French again for a few years.
I haven't seen you in ages.
I guess so.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Look at this.
Are you still having a headache?
Do you want a drink?
He finally decided to try.
He's got a strong temperament.
I want to take a break.
You'd better go.
Tom crossed the street.
I'd like another beer.
Tom looks like his mother.
I don't speak German.
Do you want to rest?
I watched the game from start to finish.
Ah, yeah.
I can hear you with my ears.
You're in touch with me.
I hate that kind of thing.
Auto almost hit me.
Talk as much as you want.
We're both students.
Tom gets up at 6:00 every morning.
They discussed the problem.
The destruction of nature is a regrettable thing.
He wants to be a doctor.
Are they all the same price?
He went back to his hometown.
A good student like Tom brings honor to our class.
I'm sorry, but that's not possible.
You should take care of your own business!
I like Tom.
I'm so tired of working hard.
I'd like to play tennis with you sometime.
How much is the exchange rate?
Never thought that way.
Snowing.
The right arm of the Freedom Sword is 12.8 meters long.
I got caught.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I know.
Never met him before.
Thank you!
You've read this book, haven't you?
Tom is losing consciousness.
They get paid a week.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's too expensive.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
Mari can dance very well.
So you want to eat?
They shot Tom.
You're keeping this a secret.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
How are you?
I'll think about it.
Have you ever seen this?
There's hardly any coffee left in the pan.
A blast of hunger!
Tom is a professional basketball player.
He likes baseball so much.
He says he's busy and hasn't contacted me in a long time.
I have a headache.
Then you have to make sure the iron is hot.
I've never eaten a mango before.
Do you have any more questions?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I need an assistant who can speak Korean.
Can you hold on a second?
Come back in a month.
Calm down!
Nobody knows the truth.
Tom laughed at the fake joke.

I have a red bike
I broke it.
Excuse me, is there a vacancy?
He plays tennis every day.
I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'll take it from here.
I don't like him.
Excuse me, but can I borrow a pencil?
I hate jealous women.
I'll help you.
Can you wait half a day?
I just moved into a new home.

Yes, I did.
I hope so too.
Can you tell me where Puerto Rico is on this map?
Tomorrow is his birthday.
He wrote a book on China.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He gave the bone to the dog.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Have you ever seen Tom without glasses?
He passed away peacefully in eternal sleep while asleep.
I have to ask you a stupid question.
He drank his glass empty.
Are you all right?
Wait a minute.
Tom and Mary were playing in the park, blowing soap bubbles.
Which do you like better, white rice or brown rice?
Do you have any questions?
You should stop smoking.
He and his father are like two berries.
I still think the internet is not a place for kids.
Tom is thirty.
Mom, what time is dinner?
I decided we weren't going.
He's a good person.
Tom walks slowly.
What is the truth all about?
I haven't seen earplugs in ages. Do you still wear these?
I'd like to log out.
Blood is water sake.
What's the matter? asked a little white rabbit.
Tom often leaves school.
I have to go now.
Have fun!
The first time I see you, I'm gonna beat you up as a musician.
Tom has high blood pressure.
Tom never changes a thing except to watch TV.
The last letter is mine.
Tom is late.
"Would you like some sugar?" "Here, please".
That's poison.
You think you're gonna be a total idiot?
No place can compete with France for good quality wines.
Tom needs help.
Where are you going?
I have some money.
That's just his way.
I'm sorry, I was selfish.
How can you eat something like that?
Mary was Tom's high school crush.
They're swimming.
When I was swimming, my leg cramped.
Get out of here!
How did he respond to the bad news?
I am disgusted not only by the appearance of the snakes, but also by the gossip.
I can't figure out what that writer is trying to say.
I'm going to be late.
Ten days since my boyfriend went to jail.
Never seen a real cow before.
I'm full of stomachs.
I've had enough!
We go to school because we want to learn.
I don't speak French at all.
If you could only meet one historical person, who would you choose?
I don't have much to talk to you.
I love you.
You must eat breakfast.
Have you got a shoe?
This won't take very long.
Tom was a poor man all his life.
What made him do that?
I'm not who you think I am.
Tom was scolding Mary.
Have a good trip!
There are times when the atmosphere can get a little tense.
I have a rather large house.
You must study for the rest of your life.
My friend's father is a famous writer.
Nothing's more fun than traveling alone.
He's looking at a desk that used to belong to my dad.
The singer has a beautiful voice.
I speak French, and I speak Spanish.
Can you please get on board?
Can you pass me the salt, please?
12 is a pair.
You can invite anyone who wants to come.
Tom was very shy, so he didn't play with the other boys.
My father was a poor labourer.
Open it!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I can't tell you how I feel.
I couldn't sleep because of the flu.
Wash your teeth after eating.
Tom and Mary held each other's hands as they watched the fog approach.
Can we go to a weight loss class together?
I don't translate for free.
Have you had lunch?
I want to read books about the Beatles.
I'm not saying that!
Leave me alone for a second.
He's really kind.
Picture.
The only sound was a ticking of the wristwatch.
They're a couple.
Since it's April Day, I'm just going to lie.
I wonder if it's OK to feed a dog a salad.
Do I have to do it now?
Tom is a perfectionist.
Tom has a good memory.
I just got home.
I only knew it was him when I heard him talk.
He set fire to the school building.
I'll be back by 7:30.
I may never make friends again.
Will you attend the afternoon meeting?
They admired the beautiful scenery from the hillside.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I have to go now.
Tom knows a boy who can ride a single-wheel.
I'm so tired of working hard.
Tom washed his car in Mary.
I'm starting to worry if I wait for my friend too long.
I didn't mean to give you that impression.
Meg was the only girl with a pair of scissors on her leg.
to be honest, I hate him.
He likes animals.
I'm gonna put my hat on his ass.
I've never seen a room this beautiful.
What's the situation?
Tom has glasses.
Jane is as beautiful as her sister.
Tom has a sharp head.
Where are you going?
Do you like your boss?
Get in! It's cold outside.
I have a lot of homework to do.
Almost all good-looking men are narcissists. I wouldn't say that right now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I won!
Do you want me to drive?
Nothing compares to home.
Tom's bicycle has been stolen.
He changed his mind.
Tom ran as fast as he could.
When did you come to Japan?
His words gave me hope.
Oh, how beautiful these flowers are.
It's not black?
I wish we had a car.
Tom sat on the couch.
Why are you still on your feet?
I'm not gonna use it.

I want to be stronger both physically and mentally.
Chiro is a cat, so he doesn't like lice.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I like chocolate.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The author translated these grains into our mother tongue.
I think we should talk outside.
It's shockingly cold today.
It's your call.
Do you have any more questions?
The minute Tom was out of his seat, Mary scratched something on her school textbook.
Let's get some food.
What do you want to eat?
I haven't seen you in a while.
Never too late to learn.
Who gave it to you?

I couldn't get your name up.
I mean, it's been a while since we've met.
We lost the game, thanks to you being such an idiot.
Hello, this is Ogawa.
I hate Tom.
This is a nice coat. Can I make this up?
He's like a mirror of his mother.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Room number five.
That's a lot of money.
A dog lost lost in our neighborhood yesterday.

Get out of here!
Is it my fault?
The bone marrow is at its best this week.
That's none of your business.
Please shut up!
I'm broke, but I accidentally bought another book.
Come here.
Tom thinks it's impossible for Mary to break the record.
Be kind to the elderly.
What have you been doing?
There's a restaurant here that I often go to eat.
It's boring!
What are you wearing?
I'm sorry about that.
The singer has a beautiful voice.
This never ends.
Don't give up in the middle of it.
He's old enough to know the truth.
Tom is already home.
What is this place?
I'm helping you for our old friendship.
Why don't you investigate the matter yourself before you ask other people?
Come whenever you want.
Don't move from here.
I'm not a very talkative person, but I just happen to have a lot of things I want to talk to you about.
Never give up?
Mr. White is almost the same age as me.
He's not studying as hard as he used to.
Tom, I think you're worrying too much.
He had a broken heart and committed suicide by hanging.
Have you ever been to Boston?
I don't see what's wrong with that.
Stay in the hat.
The noise started to subside.

I couldn't say no.
He was very angry and lost his temper.
Can you see anything?
I'm gonna ask Tom about that.
Have you decided to go to Japan?
Excuse me, can you advise me to the bus stop?
Tom showed me Mary's letter.
They're a couple.
Two flies with one blow.
, that smells!
Welcome home, Tom. We missed you.
Can I pay with a credit card?
Tom is always slow.
Nothing's wrong, so don't cry.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
How old are your kids?
I ate too much.
She married a rich old man.
Tom seemed to be hiding something.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The two companies are competing fiercely.
When you're in trouble, I'll help you.
I think that's a little expensive.
Tom is watching TV right now.
Good day, world!
I'm sorry, I don't have any change.
John woke up much earlier than usual.
The painting looks very much alive.
What am I supposed to do now?
Do you love me?
I wanna learn French.
Can you tell me about it later?
Tom has a strong voice.
Let's say he's rich.
Have you finished?
You all did well.
He's got blond hair.
The match was cancelled because of heavy rain.
I was glad I was there.
I wish it was the weekend.
How do you say "I love you" in French?
Do you like to dance?
You'd better write it down before you forget it.
That's too bad.
I had a strange dream last night.
Let me go.
Tell me what your plan is.
What do you do on Sunday?
Then that's all right.
When I woke up, I realized it was all a dream.
He was shaking from the cold.
I'd love to see you.
I agree!
I've never been to that town.
Shut up!
We decided to go on a picnic because the weather was so great.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
Her head is always full of her own stuff.
What did he do today?
I was so nervous when I heard his voice.
I'm glad you have good friends.
He was born in a small village.
Tom has good cheeks.
Tom sleeps well.
Big Brother, you've got a fever, leave your luggage alone, go rest in the shade of that tree.
A book can be compared to a friend.
Generally, boys are faster than girls.
Please, just wait.
Can I take Tom with me?
I've been busy all day.
What the hell! your exchange rate is exactly 256 yen.How exactly?Well, that's exactly two to eight.
Let me go home.
I saw Tom a few minutes ago.
Why are you asking me that?
I have to go.
Get home and rest.
I'm sure Tom is fine.
Tom is weak.
If you go to Naran, you can't miss the pears.
Tom looked around, but he didn't see anyone.
I'm a lesbian.
I didn't notice it, to be honest.
What's your impression of America?
Tom closed his eyes.
You got something in your hair.
That's a good idea!
That's my favorite song.
That's enough.
I don't care how you do it, as long as you do it.
I am disappointed in the education of this world.
We realized we were lost.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
I don't remember getting paid for that job.
I didn't realize what he really meant until yesterday.
The snowflake was melting over the water.
Why does one pair of socks always disappear?If both socks disappear, you don't realize they're missing.Oh, they are.
Can you give me a little more time?
The current legislation does not take into account the diversity of ethnic groups.
I'm in a hurry.
Don't forget your umbrella when you leave.
I'm used to getting up early.
Tom has a whiplash.
I swear it won't happen.
Do you like black cats?
As soon as the police saw him, he ran away.
How was your day today?
He's qualified as a lawyer.
I feel like even though I've been sleeping lately, I still need more sleep.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I couldn't help but laugh.
This is no pride.
After you.
I can't believe this.

Tom watches TV.
Can you bring us the bill?
I broke up with him.
Although an old building with its high-rise and imposing rooms may not be as practical as a colorless office complex to replace it, it often fits in better with its surroundings.
Tom is gone.
I love her sister very much.
I realized he was staring at me.
Have you finished the work?
If there were no water, the pieces of nature could not live.
I'm ready for anything for you.
Do you think I'm handsome?
There are books on the table.
I can't lift this rock on my own.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
All right, go home.
Get back to your seats.
I like fried chicken.
I don't have Latin lat.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
Where's your home?It's over there.
How can you be so smart?
He got caught cheating and got his life's work done.
I'll come home someday.
Can you take your socks off?
Excuse me, where are the storage cabinets?
Tom was a little drunk.
Can you turn on the lights?
Hey, shut up!
This is my friend Tom.
Calm down!
Hello, my name is Tomoka Sato from Japan.
I see!
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you about a real-life case.
I've been up almost all night.
There's a river in that valley.
I really appreciate your kindness.
You know what UNESCO is short for?
I convinced him to go to the doctor.
This is my friend.
I can't live a month on 10,000 yen.
I believe that if there is no life's work, life is wasted.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
If you're ready, eat fruit.
Get some cookies if you like.
Who are you having dinner with?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Oh, my God!
You're not forgetting your ticket.
I can't find Tim. I wonder if he's gone yet.
Have you made sure the door is locked?
I don't want to talk to anyone today.
I felt lonely.
I agree.
I wonder why.
Whose land is this?
5 plus 3 is 8.
Museum has exhibits of ancient weapons.
How are you, Tom?
Singapore has English.
You were lucky to find it.
Bye!
Tom?
Calm down now.
Please return to your seats.
Can you send this letter to the post office?
Keep going.
He cut his smoking rate to one cigarette a day.
You must obey your parents.

It was really hard.
I'm going to live in town.
I never eat breakfast.
The French version of the Taro was a heavy tank.
I don't understand German at all.
Tom solved the puzzle after getting some clues from Mary.
Can you buy concert tickets here?
That's enough!
Tom's house is haunted.
The book is simple.

The dog's loyalty makes me admire.
One is blue.

How old is your father?
Tom loved Mary, but he didn't care a single bit about her.
A shitty day keeps a doctor away.
I wish tomorrow never came.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I have your name, please?
Where did you get that book?
Tom has a dog phobia.
Stop the car!
It's almost 7:00 p.m. I have to go to school.
That's weird.
Where's the bathroom?
I bet he'll be here soon.
They're a couple.
Relax, I'll be right there.
Strange.
I got there later than usual.
Don't do this.
What made him do that?
Tom is a slow reader.
Come and visit us!
Tom fell.
I fell asleep after reading a little.
There's a bookstore in front of the store.
How can you cut so fast?
Well, I was having lunch.
Help me!
I'm sorry I'm late, I was asleep on the bomb.
I like it here.
There's no time to talk.
Tom hated Mary.
Can you explain the operating system to me?
I love you, Mari!
I hear Ninni is really cute.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

He can't even sing children's songs, not to mention opera.
My uncle is causing a split in his family.
Be kind to the elderly.

Can you help me find the wallet?
You're not gonna tell anyone about this, are you?
You're not talking about building clouds.
I don't think so.
Get the nail.
Theory and practice never meet.
Tom wiped his head with a nail polish.

How cold!
Be more calm.

I like the smell of bread crumbs.
Have you ever had any serious illnesses?
Tom seldom comes late.
Take as many peaches as you want.
I'd like to visit Boston at least once more before I die.
We're leaving in an hour.
Wake me up at 6:00 tomorrow morning.
As for him, nobody knows him better than I do.
He's obviously lying.
You wanna go out with me tonight?
He went to the gym.
Are there elevators?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Can you tell me how tall you are and how much you weigh?
Nobody knows why.
Tom didn't know that Mary liked cooking.
How beautiful your skin is
Tom is not in bed.
He's washing the car.
Team of photographers travelled the country looking for places to shoot
Are you hungry?
That doesn't mean anyone could become a poet.
You know why we're here.
You're on your way.
You're the hard worker.
Can you send me a picture of yourself?
Can I take Tom with me?
Tom is quick to walk.
He'll do what he says.
I have to go.
Thank you both.
I couldn't help but laugh.
Drive carefully.

Put on your shirts and go to bed.
I haven't been motivated lately.
He failed in his business and became bankrupt.
How did he respond to the bad news?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tell me what you want.
I should have brought my umbrella.
You look really young.
I have to go now.
I thought it was close.
There's no such thing as a person who's too old to study.
Did Tom get an answer?
These are our books.
I have no idea why he suddenly quit his job.
You can use margarine as a substitute for butter.
Tom resembles his father perfectly in both appearance and character.
They didn't care what I thought.
Can you give it to me?
What he told us a while ago makes no sense.
I think I've guessed which horse is most likely to win the most feeds.
Can you help me distribute these newsletters to the people who came?
If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
I can't wait to get a letter from you.
Why did he quit?
Do what you want.

I'm tired of it!
The guy's having an affair with your little sister!
Don't talk so sad.
His research finally paid off.
What do you think?
Which fruit do you like the most?
If Tom doesn't go, then neither do I.
Tom dislikes women.
I want to name my daughter Mari.
Let me in too.
Love your neighbor.
Tom put on his socks.
What is this?
Silence is gold.
I have to get back to work.
You're a liar.
What would you like to drink?
Tom asked the same question to several people.
I have a sore leg.
Come back tomorrow.
How many eggs did you manage to get yesterday?
Tom goes to school on foot.
Please sit down here.
You should stop blaadamine.
Joni is good at chess.
I'll write you a prescription.
I'll be right back.
Tom watches TV.
I'm sure there's a storm coming.
I quit my job, but I have some savings, so so far I don't have any problems with living.

When I was young, I used to go swimming in the sea.
Can you go out with me tonight?
This is the worst movie ever made.
Come on, hurry up!
They seem to like each other very much.
They stole my wine bottle!

Dinner is bad for your health.
I write to my mother once a month.
Tom is probably asleep.
Can I open the window?
What the fuck are you laughing at?
I'll do the job tomorrow.

Construction work blocked the road.
I fell in love with the AI that mistakenly read the word "binyu" as "horochichi".
My mother barely speaks English.
I write to my mother once a month.
I want to scream to the sea.

Our train stopped suddenly.
I live in Boston.
He goes to the bathroom every morning before breakfast.
I'm writing a diary.
He lives a busy life, so he doesn't usually meet his family.
The time form of this sentence is preesens.
He's Japanese?
All right, all right.
I want you to come with me.
You're keeping this a secret.
Turtle passed the rabbit.
News of the accident was a terrible shock to me.
Tennis is a lot of fun.
Why did you come to Malaysia?
Tom left town.
You can't have cake and eat it.
He helped the old man cross the street.
Do you like apples or bananas more?
Tom thinks of making money.
You're in touch with me.
Can you tell me how to get to Lincoln Center?
Is there anything else you want me to do?
Help me get up.
Tom has gained weight.
Once upon a time, people thought it was impossible for a human to fly.
Can I ask you your name?
He must have gotten on the wrong bus.
Thank you very much to you two.
Tom took a deep breath.
What do you think he said?
It's too expensive.

Can you fix this?
I was in the bathroom when the phone rang.
Tom is not as active as Mary.
Excuse me, can you give me some advice on how to use a washing machine?

What are the differences between religion and philosophy?
Traveling abroad is a lot of fun.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't yell at the chair in the morning.
Show me something else.
I don't have a pencil.
Give him your wallet.
Can death alone be the only way to be free?
I'm mad at Tom.
It's dark in here.
We have a lot of work to do.
Nearby, I thought I was under the car.
Shall we take the vanilla junk in half?Sopii!
He's no more a doctor than I am.
What's your name?
It's dangerous!
Tom is their leader.
He used to sit on the back of the car after work, pick up a book and study.
What are you looking for?
You keep this a secret.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Can I have a bill, please?
He's in a very dangerous situation.
Tom knocked on the door.
I was having lunch.
Excuse me, but can you repeat what you said?
Start time.
They completed the project as planned.
I think you were Tom's subordinate.
I want to speak English fluently.
I want to send a package to Japan.

He was careless and went to bed on the TV.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom has already gone to bed.
I thought it was free.
Can you borrow a knife?

I wish summer would come soon.
I'm starving to death!
Leave me alone, please.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thank you for the advice.
Tom is lazy.
Tom has never seen another girl as beautiful as Mary.
I love you!
I've never heard of one of those before.
It's pure white.
Didn't you get a message from Tom about today's meeting?
I don't trust anyone anymore.
Mark has my book.
What's the matter?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There's no other way than to go.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He worked tirelessly to find out the truth.
How was the test?
That's because you're a girl.
Make yourself at home.
Earthquakes and floods are natural disasters.
I have to go now.
I like pig-breaking, I've been a ballboy for a long time.
I'm in the bath.

The CEO is a foot-on-the-ground type.
You don't have to be in too much of a hurry.
Can you please speak more slowly?
muki!
Have a great weekend.
Coffee, please.
Tom scratched the fireplace.
Please forgive me.

You can't be serious!
You're gonna wait for Tom to come in time, right?
He blew from his wound.
They seem to love each other very much.
I'm dying of hunger!
Tokyo has a population greater than London.
Tom is a handsome man.
It's Tom.
Bye!
I lost my mind.
You should ask someone for advice.
I've never seen it before.
I have a hunch.
I had a foot cramp while I was swimming.
Kati found the watch she lost.
He ran.
He bought a ticket.
Tom must be mad.
How far is Kyoto from Osaka?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When I arrived at the station, the train had just left.
You have a good musical personality.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm happy.
I'm flying to Hano tomorrow.
Tom is exhausted.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's used to being up all night.
I'm happy.
I heard that there were footprints of a snowman in the Himalayas.
Breakfast is ready.
Tom can do it.
Hey, did you hear what I said?
He's honest, which is why I like him.
Tom is not here.
I have to go now.
Never lie to me.
Sport has made him what he is today.
Tom fell into the mud.
Never too late to learn something new.
You're just like your father.
The surgery went well.
I'm totally fucked up.
The dictionary is within reach.
Thank you for inviting me.
That's broken.
I'm all fired up.
He's got an incredibly valuable ring.
Can I open the windows?
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
It's really hot today.
I fell asleep after reading a little.
Can you turn it down?
Stop smoking.
The elderly must be respected.
Why?
Have you decided where we're having lunch?
Tom wanted to ask questions, but he didn't.
Nordic wind blows all day.
He has five older brothers.
Where's the toothpaste?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
We showed him pictures from the Alps.
The occasion started almost the same way as we arrived in the auditorium.
I don't have a penny.
She's not the beauty of her mother.
I'm not seeing her anymore.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom didn't bring it when he came.
Tom is my high school classmate.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's none of your business.
I just started to snow.
He's got a new car and an old car.
Smith teaches English?
Get your head up!
Tom is not like Mary.
️Please buy me some apples.
What would you like to eat?
What happened to Tom?
Are there direct flights between Boston and Sydney?
I always keep my room as clean as possible.
What's the matter?
I'll call you back later.
I don't know much about it.
Storm fell a big tree.
Drive carefully.
This book is intended for students who speak a language other than Japanese.
To make a reservation, you need to use his name.
I can walk at least two miles.
The Democrats haven't picked their candidate yet, but whoever they choose, they're going to lose.
How was your test today?
Have you finished reading the book?
This is the latest fashion.
You'll return your paper by the end of the month.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
This dress is too big for me.

Have you got hearing aids?
I wish it was a weekend.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I feel like I'm gonna get a good night's sleep tonight.
I don't have a job, so I can't save money.
I suspect I have a nervous breakdown.
I'm not tired at all.
The right hand is not lifting.
He's a famous physicist, not only in Japan, but all over the world.
Get Tom to come.
I wanna go to Australia once more before my passport goes out of date.
A lot of stars in the sky.
Take a look at Tom.
If we're gonna be honest, I don't know anything about it.
Excuse me, but can you just let me go?
I'd like to go out and have fun with you next weekend.
Tom replied?
Tom went to see Mary in the village yesterday.
I just moved in.
I almost got hit by a car.
I hardly ever walk to work.
He's always in class.
He must be over 50.
Tom finally got his dream house.
Hey, what's going on?
What's in this?
Tom suddenly started laughing.
He won't admit he's wrong.
He cut off the call.
When you've finished, you'll cry.
Tom's illness was the result of overeating.
Can I have your name, please?
Tom doesn't know anything about programming.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the station?
I'll forgive you this once.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the beach?
Don't worry about it.

We'll have exams as soon as the summer vacation ends.
Tom is not alone now.
Tom didn't know that Mary had decided to quit her job.
I thought you were gonna keep Tom here till I get back.
I've had my time.
I wrote to Mr. Wood last week and asked him to give you a job on the farm.
The phone rang in the middle of my bath.
The old people like to go to the street corner and talk to them about these.
Tom was there too.
The story he told us recently makes no sense.
He messed up again?
The key is to have a hobby.
We've never been down this road before, have we?
There's a cat on the chair.
This is the last match.
I'm not saying you're playing fair, but I'd like you to stop acting reckless.
Did you get a good night's sleep last night?
Keep your room as clean as you can.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

You can say anything.
To love me?
What makes you laugh?
Yes, it is.
The wind was so strong, the windows were ringing.
He shouted in a colourful voice: Help!
No matter how busy he is, he'll probably be here.
I slipped my loose chest down.
I rarely walk to work.

When you're young, it's good to read a lot of books.
He saw me and said hello, lifting his hat a little.
He's a good man.
This time, I was in a private house for the first time and it was something.

I'm coming the same way as you.
You're not getting any fat.
I think he's free tomorrow.

Do you have any more questions?
Tom is in a bad mood.

He came in the back door, so nobody would notice.

Papa's out for a walk in the park.
Try again.
Tom must be asleep.
I can't go a day without this dictionary.
The truth is, I don't know anything about it.
Where are you going?
I'll be home by 7:30.
Tom is in the kitchen.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom was angry.
Tom is completely untrustworthy.

That's just his way.
You can see thousands of stars in the sky.
This is insane!
Tom is a handsome man.
I hate jealous women.
He's younger than me.
I'm glad to see you again.
Where is the wedding?
That's why I lied.
What did Tom bring?
The kids were running around the park.
It's Saturday.
Tom was drunk.
They run like pigs from a rifle.
Don't be such a silly asshole!
Can you stop talking bad about Tom?
You should focus on your own business.
If there were no water, no living creature could live.
I apologized.

I just cleaned my room today, so why is it so messed up?
The hall was full.
When was the last time you rode a bike?
Why didn't you come to the party last night?
Tom knows what's really going on.
I'm sorry, but it just happened so suddenly, I haven't gotten it under control yet.
-Seriously?
Sorry, I slept on the bomb.Again?I'm tired of hearing your son-in-law, Tom.No sori!
Tom was sentenced to death.
He's lucky. He's the one who's lucky.

Tom's face was blazing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Thank you for helping me.
Thank you for coming.
We tried to take advantage of the opportunity.
This is good.
What did you do this weekend?
Beware of angry dogs!
Can you help me a little?
I mean, it's the flu.
Kati was forced to read that book.
What's in this?
What's that sound?
There he comes!

Tom, keep your voice down!
It only takes 10 minutes to walk from here.
Let me show you the car I just bought.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When I went to visit her, she was asleep, but I woke her up.
There's not much difference between the two.
The waves swallowed the boat.
Tom has a high voice.
French is not spoken here.
I wish I'd brought my computer.
I'll think about it.
I'm being unfair.
He made her a new dress.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That's my favorite song.
You like a deer!
Tom is a bad athlete.
I usually go for a walk.
Silence is silent!
Marie was always a nice kid.
Where are you going?
Get me out of here.
I wanna ask Tom if he feels the same way.
I don't like being talked to.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Marie hid her face in her hands.
I'm a student at the university.
Can you fix it?
Tom is a terrible squirrel.
Get up!
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.
Where does it hurt?
Can you get help?
Get out of here!
He does that sometimes.
We couldn't go to the beach because of the rain.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Shut up!
I cut off the patient's head with ice.
I don't believe in beauty, so I've been restless for the last couple of days. But now finally the time has come when I know that there are bodies buried under the cherry trees. This is the best faith.
I have five people in my family.
I'd bite my tongue!
The next morning, the snowflake had disappeared without a trace.
I'm gonna be busy next month.
What kind of egg do you want?
Finally, we're alone.
Tom is not a hero.
Can you hold on a second?
I wish I was born into a little larger family... Oh, yeah, I'm a man, which is no use to me.
He doesn't listen to the teacher.
Hey, didn't I just say I was sorry?
I think you have the flu.
I'm thirsty.
Please sit down and wait.
We have to get up early tomorrow, so should we start going to bed slowly?
We don't have soap.

Why are you still up?
Please return to your seats.
That's too small.
I love you more than anything in the world.
I'm terribly sorry.
Tom's proposal is worth considering.
Nearby, I thought I was under the car.
Do you get grooms from that store?
Can I turn on the lights?
How was today's game?
I'd like to come with you, but I don't have any money.
You got a stomachache?
I'm in the same high school as Tom.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I will never forget your kindness.
After I got homework done, I talked to my mom.
I'm gonna throw you home.
What's the picture?
No need to worry.
Everything is going to be fine.
They're each other's half-spouses.
Tom doesn't speak French.
Where are you going?
Come on, now!
I like to put an ice cream cone in my coffee because it's usually too hot.
Well, what's the matter?
Tom was drunk.
Thank you for inviting me.
He's still dependent on his parents.
He was away when I went to visit him.
I don't know if I can do it, but I'm trying.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom seeks work.
What do you think?
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear.
Stand up straight and relax your shoulders.
Men's toilets are on the first and third floors.
I'll read the book while you sleep.
Keep in touch.
Please drive carefully.
There was no room left in the hall.
I must have gotten the flu.
I remember that place.
Tom, are you sleeping?
Leave it alone.
I don't care what they say.
If you need a dictionary, I have an old one that I could lend to you.
Do you want me to turn off the lights?
A day without humor is a very sad day.
to be honest, I hate him.
I thought this was gonna be easy, but we've been working all day, and we're still not ready.
It's just what you say.
It was addressed to Tom and Mary.
Tom asked his question again.
Two kids sitting on the real thing.
The server is down again.
Can you get me a toothbrush?
Get a little closer.
Tom, you are an idiot!
He wants a new hat.
A long time ago!

Have you got a can?
I usually go to the country at 10:00.
He was able to solve the problem.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
"Thanks" in Japanese?
Now that my older brother is a university student, he has to read a lot of books.
I'd like a glass of wine.
I feel like I've been sleeping too much lately.
I want to scream towards the sea.
What is the purpose of adding such a needless quality?
You can add sentences you can't translate yourself Maybe someone else can!

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm not in the mood for a chat.
Don't worry, she'll make it.
How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
The house was very poorly built.
Why are you so angry?
I'm gonna ask Tom about that.
Have you got a blanket?
What's the matter?
I don't understand German at all.
Who are you?
Don't let this opportunity slip from your hands.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
If Tom doesn't go, then I won't go.
No one can stop me!
Help me!
All the signs are saying he's recovering.
Can I have some more cake?
I'm sure it's snowing tomorrow.
Have a nice vacation!
Can you let me go home?
Tom no longer plays guitar.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Are you Japanese?
I like jazz.
Tokyo has a population greater than London.
I like French, but that doesn't mean I like French soil.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thank you for the good advice.
How much is this?
Let's get to the point.
I'm in the middle of eating.
What are you thinking?

Oh, my God!
Mama bought me two cans of orange juice.
I don't have any money.
I don't need this.
He looks like a student.
When making a dress, you need to take precise measurements.
Don't come any closer!
Hokkaido is on the north side of the Sendai.
I'm on my way.
He's determined.
Who owns this place?
Don't say anything.
How tall are you and how much do you weigh?
George?The housewife said.Who is George?
I have a return flight ticket to Osaka.
Can you answer this?
Can you write it down for me?
Green light!
You're keeping this confidential.
Tom is reliable.
Tao when iron is hot.
Tom spoke to Mary yesterday.
Tom tried not to hurt Mary.
Where are you from?
Tom is afraid of the dark.
It's time to go.
It hurts!
Keep your room as clean as you can.
I think they're both right.
Have you ever been to Canada?
I've had enough.
So, go ahead, go ahead.
This is his house.
He's got flaws too.
Tom watched.
I'm wearing a green shirt.
Moro!
Who is that?
Tom, the train is not a dance floor!
I hope they can reach a peaceful settlement.
I should have gone to law school too.
If you want a new bike, you'd better start saving money.
How's work?
What he told us recently was totally meaningless.
Are our bathrooms clean?
It was my only option.
I have a feeling we've seen it somewhere before.
He was cutting wood from Buddha's stake.
Do you know why he's so angry?
Where are you going?
I wish I had a car.
He gave up.
Tom has never been to Boston.
Who is that?
How many hours do you usually go to bed?
I'm sure this piano hasn't been played in years.
I don't deserve to live.
There was no one else in the room, except Mary and John.
I think it's gonna be hot today too.
How would we solve this problem?
Too late for that.
We watched a TV show recently about your landlords.
He's not as smart as his big brother.
Jump down!
I have a headache.
You like it?
Tom's eyes are blue.
Hello world!
It's close by on foot.
Can I have a bill, please?
I hate studying.
Hey, how are you?
Tom made a fortune in oil.
I feel like if you're having a good weekend, you can get a good time at work.
Don't say anything!
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the station?
He went out to eat.
Are you hungry?
Get the fire ready!
Joni is smart.
Help me, I might have lost my passport.
I'm gonna try it again.
They're friends.
Tom is absolutely awesome.
Who do you think can do such a thing?
Tom is terribly shy.
That's right.
I'm not saying it's impossible.
Soldier told me his name.
Tom's face is red.
I'm looking for a present for my mom.
If you took the items one at a time and looked at them.
Yesterday was really good.
I haven't spoken to anyone lately.
Tom thinks that Mary always packs too much baggage.
I never imagined in my wildest dreams that things would go this way.
Don't get caught up in other people's business.
No one can ever help me.
He left me.
I don't think there's going to be anyone else here tonight.
You were a real help.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You can hear me calling anytime!
What is your job?
I went to the hospital.
You expecting something?
When you see this email, you will definitely give it to 10 people within 12 hours.
I ate dinner late last night.
Do you have many friends here in Japan?
I can say I don't speak French very well.

Second thing, do you play the violin?
Scorpions are dangerous.
In short, the project failed.
He gave his work his undivided attention.
Tom told Mary his mother's oatmeal recipe.
I'm not gonna be mad at her, even if she doesn't show.
Where's your school?
She stayed up late, waiting for her son to come home.
How mature do you want to be with the steak?
I'm worried about my weight.
I like going to the baseball games.

This is a true story.
Everyone in the room was crying for relief.
Who's going?
I'm 30 now.
We made some pastries for breakfast.
So, you should have taken responsibility.
Be careful.
He can't be treated the way we normally do.
No need to worry.
Tom is in the public eye.
Because it was Sunday, I didn't try to get up early.
I have a migraine.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

How would you like your eggs?
I've been home for a week, but I still have a time difference problem.
How did that happen?
I have three dogs.
Can you hold on a second?
How many and where do we meet?
Make yourselves at home.
What kind of person would do something like that?
The server is at its best, and we apologize for the inconvenience and ask you to wait until the server is restored.
Who gave you this?
What is that?
This is a perfectly certain thing.
There's no need for that.
He's a doctor.
I'd like to get back the book I loaned you a while back.
Look at that!
Do you still love Tom?
Can you help me?
Don't be ridiculous!
He's throwing a party next week.
That's funny.
Tom got home at 3:30.
He didn't answer.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
He seems to have been rich before.
I'll be back by 6:30.
I won!
I don't like to go out when it rains.

He went to the store.
He was retarded in his spiritual development.
He's old.
I call her every day.
Tom always gets the flu right away.
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
Can you forgive me?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I've been feeling bad all day.
Tom comes here every day.
How much longer do you think it'll last?
I don't know if they have enough money.
Ah, that's what I thought, the library's closed tomorrow.
He's my friend.
This dress is a real find.
Iron is much more useful than gold.
There's no soap.
I couldn't go outside because of the bad weather.
Have you fallen in love with someone?
What time does the next train to Tokyo leave?
People don't like to go out in fashion.
Why did he go to her once he proposed to that woman?
I want you to behave yourself when you eat.
I'm a little busy.
The earthquake suddenly destroyed buildings.
Nick looks down on everyone from the country.
Tom should be here at noon.
What does that word mean?
When he saw me, he laughed.
Rain all week.
What does that word mean?
Now I realize! Tom suddenly screamed.
This big sofa probably won't fit a small room.
Tom has never travelled on a plane.
Can I eat this mushroom?You can eat anything once.
I think so.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Can you open the window?
I am a free man.
Your big brother is really mad.
I think we should ask Tom.
I don't remember what dinner was like last night.
The hall was full of speakerphone before the curtain was lifted.
He almost drowned, but his father saved him.
When does it start?
I'm sure it's starting to snow.
It was fun.
Coffee, please.
Can you please just keep it down?
I don't like this kind of music.
I don't know if I have time or not.
I'll be back later.
He hit his older sister.
This is a scratch on my neck.
Tom still can't read.
She lives with her parents.
Talk to me.
If I became a pig, would you still be my friend?Of course!
Tom went shopping with her.
He jumped on the train.
Get on the pressure!
What time did you go to bed last night?
You thought margarine was good?
When I heard my name, I answered it without knowing it.
Why?
Today, people living in rural areas rather than urban areas are growing steadily.
I'm gonna put my paycheck on my clothes for the whole month.
Can you change the ticket, please?
He's a little unknown to me.
Kati is smarter than any other student in her second year.
Our class is 40 boys.
"Six pence a second", Roope reminded me.
How'd you make this soup?
This is a piggyback.
I'll just have some toast and some coffee.
Tom was shocked to learn that Mary had died.
I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I want to eat!
Tom likes to be alone.
Helen always gets the best numbers in her class.
I finally found a solution.
I'm going to school.
Can I have a map of the city, please?
Tom gets up at 8:00 every morning.
Tom is studying French.
How did you know I was here?
Never heard of him.
I'm going to breathe for a second.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The room is being cleaned.
The old people like to chat around the corner.
I don't want to humiliate myself in front of him.
How was the match test?
I hate being treated like a child.
Tom drew this picture.
He's mad at you.
Don't you want to swim today?
Your carelessness is no excuse.
Help me!
Her new husband turned out to be a terrible person.
Do you like your mother?
Tom has a big mouth.
What do you mean?
I walked around all day and now I'm totally freaked out.
I'll have another beer.
Tom had a strange dream last night.
Whose shoes are these?
Nice to meet you here.
How old is your father?
I agree with you on taxes.
You're tired of something?
When the class heard that a new student was coming, there was a stirring up.
Don't wake a sleeping bear.
You look like you've lost weight.
They're in the hands of the gods.
See you later.
Put your seat belt on.

I'm taking a couple of days off.
Tom is back with his ex-wife.
I have a friend whose father is a famous actor.
You hurt Tom pretty bad.
I can't get this job done in an hour.
I'm sorry about the last time.
You shouldn't be climbing mountains in such bad weather.
I've had the best mozzarella of my life, of course, in a Neapolitan restaurant.
Can you close the door, please?
That's a good idea.

Tom opened the safe.
Can you show me on the map?
Tom dropped out of high school in the middle of the term.
This is about my little brother, who has been hanging out with bad people lately.
Don't laugh at him for making a mistake.
I don't like sports like tennis or golf.

Let's get married when we're big.Joo!
The banana is ruined.
What do you do in your free time?
There's no place like home.

Oh, I was scared!
What's your name?
Can I borrow this pencil?
Do you mind if I join you?No of course!
I'm going to the store soon.
If it looks like an apple and tastes like an apple, it's probably an apple.
Can you show me something else?
You know Tom likes to travel.
How old are your kids?
A deeply religious belief in the afterlife.
Car is in the garage.
It's a little cold.

Try asking Tom again.
Listen to what he says.
Can you turn on the TV?
Galileo Galilei
Jump!
Is that true?
How much do you love Tom?
You should focus on your own business.
Can you call me at 7:30, please?
No need to pack.
Touch this, it's so soft!
I couldn't go for a walk because of the storm.
I'm getting hurt when I'm getting my toes cut off.
Are you and Tom back together?
What are you talking about?
I can't wait to see you again.
I spoke to him nicely.
Where are you going?
I agree.
Tom has a lot of willpower.
Can I borrow your car?
Tom loved Mary.
Yesterday was my birthday.
I can read English, but I can't speak it.
I got cold.
There is no need to draw any hasty conclusions.
The lake is deepest here.
I can't help but wonder if everyone else is the same.
He's a pig.

He emptied his desk.
A middle-aged woman with a rug on her back looked like she was looking for a seat.
It was getting dark and worse, we were lost.
I don't like going out in the rain.
Never seen a baby so cute before!
Is this place free?
You're bleeding from your nose.
I know.
Tom is interested in women only on the basis of their appearance.
I wanna go abroad sometime.
The truth is, I don't know anything about it.
I heard winter was gonna be colder than usual.
What a beautiful garden!
That's not my ticket.
I can't drink such a sweet thing.
When he got lost, he thought, "I wish I'd listened to his advice".
You all did a good job.
I changed the layout of my homepage.
Get to the bathroom.
I laughed so hard I thought I was dying.
Tom is an exemplary boy.

Can you turn on the lights?
Tom is on the roof.
I broke up with my boyfriend who I dated for three years.
A lion lay in the middle of a cage.
He turned down her offer.
He recommended a blue tie to a client.
Remove this file.
Tom works carelessly.
Tom broke the window.
The plane had just left.
You hungry?
The police wanted to avoid the massacre.
He went to bed.
Tom collapsed.
The man tastes coffee.
I paid $200 in taxes.
Oh, if only I could live and do whatever I want.
Ahead?
I'm sorry, but I'm not feeling well.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
Why do you want to be a nurse?

Can you tell me how to get there?
I thought I'd go there once, but I haven't really had the chance to go there.
What do you do when you're on vacation?
That's a good thing.
Can I turn on the TV?
I'm coming with you.
Tom doesn't know how to say things in French.
You speak English perfectly.
You're keeping this to yourself, aren't you?
The contestants fought over the ball.
I can't understand how he feels.
I'd like to marry her.
I'm gonna be back in an hour.
Be careful!
Of course you are!
Tom said he thought Mary was still living with her parents.
Please shut up!
I looked around.
I'm being straight.
Thank you for the lovely meal.
I went to the grocery store.
He decided not to go to the party.
I made a doll for Ann.
Tom almost died last summer.
I'm going now.
They're just the tears of a crocodile.
Tom is a good person.
Who drew this picture?
Can I ask you why?
I hope Tom never does that again.
It's really hot today.
He decided to live in Tokyo instead of Osaka.
He promised me he'd be back at 4:00.
I'd love to spend the weekend with you.
Don't you want to buy my CD?
I'm in Boston.
There is no such thing as a rebellion against the laws of nature.
My son can count a hundred.
How old are you?
I have nightmares a lot.
I have a son who just turned three.
You should have bought another bottle of wine.
The fun is over.
I'm full.
Let's be clear.
Have you ever been to Africa?
You didn't know?
He or I have to attend that meeting.
I don't believe in this kind of thing.
Tom only sleeps in class, so it looks like he's going to school to sleep.
He was a quiet man once.

I didn't quite understand what you were talking about.
Are you single?
I'm interested in the history of Asia.
Can I have the book?

I'll admit it.
The more skills you have, the more you can contribute to society.

If you want to lose weight, it's best to eat properly and exercise enough.
He came an hour later than we agreed.
Can you get another cup of tea?
I don't know why the meeting was postponed.
I'm in Boston.
How do you stop the fuss?
Is it far?
You can go home for me if you want.
It was a fun breakfast with everything else except the weather.
We slept all day yesterday.
He likes her.
I'm so sick of walking around all day.
Tom, you look very dreamy.
Can I take your plate?
I'm lucky I got an accident. We took the full backup the day before.

I counted on him to help me.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
What time is it?
That's a big dog!
How long have you been dating your girlfriend?
Tom wiped his glasses clean.
Birds singing.
After reading something good, don't write anything, don't say anything, don't dare to spoil that beautiful charm with your shameless dirty words.
Tom's proposal is worth considering.
We were in a strange situation
I know this soup is good, but I think it's a little too strong for me.

Tell me when you're tired.
Tom's face is red.
I'll be back in a minute.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The wind is blowing from the north.
Why don't you just do some research on it yourself before you ask anyone else?
Tarou, you ever get a full score on a test after you went to high school?
Make yourselves comfortable.
Tom shouted as loud as he could.
The sun shone behind the sky.
A shame.
Get him!
Have a great weekend!
They admired the beautiful scenery from the hillside.
Tom is a guy that's hard to hate.
I think he's free tomorrow.
Give me a way to let this lady through.
How did that happen?
Shut up!
Tom often misses meetings.
He's never met her.
No one's home today, so why don't you come to the village?
What he told us recently was totally meaningless.
Bob charges me $3 an hour for mowing the lawn.
He worked for over five hours nonstop.
Don't reveal the secret of your carelessness.
Have you eaten after dinner?
Excuse me, this is my place.
Have you got something to do tomorrow?
I don't care what you say.
Tom wrote down his phone number.
Roman history is very interesting.
The unification of the world economy leads to instability between countries.

Make yourself at home.
I thought it was a breeze this afternoon?
Can you let me go home?
Is there anything else you want me to do?
My mother hates writing letters.
Have you ever had a serious illness?
I like blue.
The holiday is over.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
If you want the best fried chicken in Gulfport, you've got to go to Grandma's Chicken.
Tom, I want to hear your voice soon.
Have you seen this?
Please sit down.
I wish I didn't have to work.
Excuse me, but can you tell me how to get to the post office?
The company produces a number of different instruments.
Bird is flying.
Tom is an orphan.
I should know the result by Thursday.
To play the card, one more card is needed.
Tom arrived three minutes early.
You're keeping this a secret.
How old are your kids?
What kind of clothes should I wear to my date tomorrow?
I see.
Sega used to make video game consoles.
I didn't say that!
It's better you don't tell Tom about it.
Tom se guesses to violence.
I went to the hospital.
Help me to stand.
I couldn't help but laugh.
He sells food.
Oh, so Alex is a woman?
He gave up.

Can you do it at 6:00?
I tried to open it, but no way.
I wanna be able to do something like that.
Tom admitted his mistake.
I got mad.
Tom is stubborn.
He's at work.
Kati went to a party to see her friend.
Do you have a motorcycle?
Have you ever eaten Mexican food?
I spent as much as $100 today.
We seldom sing.
Never seen it before.
Tom unlocked the main gate.
That's a good idea.
Can someone help me?
I'm still in a bad mood.
They admired the beautiful scenery from the hillside.
I was just in the bathroom when the phone rang.
Make yourselves at home.
Are you all right?
I think the wind's up.
Sit down, please.
Don't worry about it!
You're the kind of guy who's the most vomiting.
Tom's house was struck by lightning.
See you later.
I can't tell the difference between the two.
Have you got any siblings?
I'm taking a break now.
Don't lie to me again.

Help me!
I'm practicing judo.
He can't even sing children's songs, and he's playing opera.
We met in Boston.

Have you ever been to Africa?
That's great!
Can I ask you something?
Can you please get on board?
Today is Sunday.
I know you don't like them.
I got a letter from a friend.
I'd like to send these to Australia.
Yeah, I know, parents can be really annoying.
I'm sorry I accidentally opened your letter.
That's almost impossible.
Tom is a smart nose.
What's your mother's maiden name?
You're sorry about the haircut?
That's too sad.
I don't want to be with anyone else.
It's easy.
Can I have a glass of water, please?
I don't speak French at all.
I have to go now.
I saw a woman and two dogs in the car.
I got a weird e-mail.
I don't wanna go out this afternoon.

Don't lie to me!
Can I ask you?
How many hours did you go to bed last night?
Can you borrow your dictionary?
I didn't hear you came in.
Pintoa!
Welcome to Japan.
There's a telephone machine at that corner.
Can you hold on a sec?
I went to bed early.
I'm in a difficult position right now.
Where can I sit?Wherever you want.
Did he fail again?
Tom is a person who always says everything straight.

What is this?
He won that race easily.
This is exactly how he works.
Don't even think about it.

How can you be so smart?
There must be something wrong with the machine.
Tom is smart.
You haven't lost any weight?
I don't need to.
Unfortunately, we're out of coffee.

When he stopped speaking, everyone was silent.
The gemstone was found in a surprising place.
I'm studying French and web design.
I need a envelope.
It's your inner circle.

Tom speaks very clearly.
Tom probably didn't know that Mary was already married.
I almost got hit by a car.
Make yourselves at home.
If Tom goes, I go.
Can you let me do that?
The house needs to be repaired.
Excuse me, where's the taxi?
When I talk about strawberries, I think of a grilled cheese.
Thank you for explaining.
See you later!
It's awfully cold today.
There are three windows in this room.
Tom doesn't care about politics.
I'm waiting for your word.
Get this on you.
I don't like being ridiculed.
If a man is kind to me, I'll like him instantly.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Hey, listen to me.
Suddenly Tom started crying.
He's reading a book.
What a relief!
How can you be so smart?
He had a superpower over his manager.
Are you ready?
Tom got that nickname in high school.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's a pessimist.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I wanna ride a horse.
Do you care what other people think of you?
Why me?
Excuse me.
He says this winter is the coldest in 20 years.
You should have called me.

The chicken ate better.
Then you have to make sure the iron is hot.
Can you advise me to the station?
Papa sent me a lot of money.
Who knows who he is?
I'll call you later, okay?
Aargh, now you're really starting to get angry.
Call the police.
We're good friends now, but we didn't like each other at first.
Tom can sing a few French songs.
Let's talk about solar energy.
He won that race easily.
I've known him for about a year.
I'm a little bit of a mountain.
I don't remember that.
I can't explain it either.
Please fasten your seat belt.
Finally, we're alone.
I need something to write.
I can sing.
Mr. Whitel seems to have many friends.
Oh, what beautiful flowers!
I'm sorry I was here so long.
I think it's kind of weird that he doesn't say a word about it.
You got a crush now?
The report you wrote has almost no errors.
His wife seems to be leaving somewhere.
Call me Tom.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I've never seen a game like this.
Miss Smith is an English teacher?
I'd love to come.
I don't wanna go out this afternoon.
Take this medicine after a meal.
Tom, are you happy now?
Let me see it.
I knew he was angry the minute I saw him.
Don't stare other people in the face.
I'd like to give her a birthday present.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's sick.
Do you speak French?
Have you got a driver's license?
What's your interest in baseball?
What year were you born?
All little kids know that book.
Where are you going?
Can you double the bill?
I'm lucky to have you.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What did I do?What's next?I washed my white slippers and now they're dirtier than before.
Come here, Joni.
Hey, if you eat at this hour, you'll eat meat!
You're good with black.
I enjoy talking to him at the party.

Tom closed his eyes.
Can I have salt, please?
I'm going to talk about the importance of sport in the modern community.
I never change the way I do things.
Tom likes cheese.
I couldn't say no.
Tom was dying.
Come to the party.
Lie on your left side.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You seem to disagree.
Sit down.
Tom must be excited.
How about a walk after lunch?
Where did you get that book?
Hello?
I'm a little shy.
I'm sorry, I was just gonna joke.
You speak French very well.
They admired the beautiful scenery on top of the mountain.
Tomorrow.Tomorrow.Are you alone? Where are all the others?On the way there, you're still alive.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
English isn't easy, but it's interesting.
I'm giving my son the money.
I agree with you about taxes.
Never had such a large sum of money.
Can you make it smaller?
Let's go to one?
Tom raises tropical fish.
You can also add sentences that you don't know how to translate.
Sometimes, prices change without notice.
Winning isn't everything.
Don't cry now, I'm gonna cry too when I see you crying.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is the strongest of them all.
How about a glass of milk?
That's why I want to talk to Tom.
Her hands are beautiful.
Close the door, please.
Tom hates cheese.
Slowly now.
I don't have Latin lat.
Tom got fired.
Tom has been my friend for many years.
Make this right.
What's in that desk box?
I wish someone could do my homework for me.
Our teacher gives us a lot of homework.
The price of the room is high, but otherwise there's nothing wrong with it.
What are you all talking about?
I was having lunch.
Can I call you in three and a half hours?
Have a good trip!
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
You should bring an umbrella.
I just remembered that I have one thing I have to do.
You like swimming?
Tom looked in the locker room.
You didn't know?
What's your dad doing?
There's nothing wrong with you, so don't worry.
He's crazy about baseball.
Do you want some milk?
Have fun!
Mama's there in half an hour.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I borrow your car?
How old are you?
Everyone spoke too fast, so at first it was hard for me to understand.
Thank you for your hard work.
He did it himself.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Black is the last bridge I've felt, so no one stalks me all the time.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Good night, mother.
Just to be sure, I'm asking you, shouldn't we wear a school uniform tomorrow?
I'm so busy here, I'm gonna have to run my head off on my third leg.
I don't like being ridiculed.
Can I have a pillow?
Is it my fault?
Don't get involved in other people's business.
Come to the village!
Can you call me at 7:30, please?
It was dark.
I like tennis.
Soon the ghost disappeared in a thick fog.
There's a busy club business I'd like to talk about, so why don't you come to the teacher's room?
I was having lunch.
He's my old buddy.
He promised me he'd be back at 4:00.
If I'm honest, I didn't pay much attention to it.
I have a lot of homework to do.
Tom has blue eyes.
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to do it.
The wall was built of rough stone.
Tom prefers to speak with his fists than his mouth.
Stop shaking your jaws and do your job!
Why did you quit?
I've been practicing piano every day for 15 years.
Cherry blossoms are at their best.
We're looking forward to it.
He's always joking around.
David is home.
Excuse me, but can I use your phone?
Tom is in the attic.
He's running.
I wish I had a car.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Keep your hands to yourself!
"I felt bad, but I'm fine now", he said.
This is too big for me.
Tom goes to school on a bike.
Why do you think so?
This man is dead.
I'm trying to.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The wind sits next to me.
I made a mistake.
A long time ago!
When a man whispered something in her ear, she felt as if she had been hypnotized and moved as he told her.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the airport?
No need to worry.
Do you think I'm fat?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thanks for the help.No more.
Calm down, good man!
The boy fell off the bed.
Don't you think it smells so good?
Mayuko hasn't slept enough.
Do they all have a lead?
Tom is dressed.
Indian people consider cows sacred.
He took the matter to court.
He promised to help me.
Geocaching is a new sport.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He surrendered.
If you're a good boy, I'll give you candy.
He speaks French as his mother tongue.
Come on, hurry up!
Excuse me, please.
No one can force you to do anything against your will.
You like bowling?
Tom was a tough guy.
I don't like to talk in public.
The rich get rich and the poor get poor.
Are you cops?
Can you ski tonight?
Tom reads slowly.
I've been tired all day.
Who wouldn't happen to have a correctional paper?
Have fun!
He's Japanese?
Can you speak to Tom for me?
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
Remove your hat, please.
When I got on the train, it was a whistle, but now it's raining.

Buses went after each other.
I had to compete with him for promotion.
Children playing!
Hey, we could do fine while we're walking down the forest path and enjoying a little forest...
Nearby, I thought I was under the car.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

He couldn't have done that.
I imagined that the job of newly graduated university workers was probably just to write documents, copy and other background work, but I was completely wrong.
Tom is not interested in politics.
Get this over with.
Tom is in the hospital.
They seem to love each other very much.
Just before I stepped out of the study room, the doctor waved me goodbye.
I'm actually back together with my old boyfriend.
Can I have the bill, please?
Can you walk?
Tom and Mary are good friends.
He choked on the smoke that filled the room.
Mama tied the tape to her daughter's hair.
You are so beautiful.
I'm drunk with this.
He's used to playing tennis every Sunday.
We've been living here for two years, in April.
Tom is asleep?
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Tom, you're just pretending to be asleep, aren't you?
I don't know.
Have you ever coughed?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I have this?
Your baby came on a countdown night.
The restaurant service was the most polite.
You seem to be very weak on food, don't you?
There is no other choice but to obey his orders.
You should quit smoking.
Can you get me the bill?
The wind is calm.
Wait a minute.
Let me look at that list.
He's a very kind person.
Have you found the umbrella you said you destroyed a few days ago?
Can you join us?
I feel like even though I've been sleeping after I've been able to sleep lately, I still can't get enough sleep.
He's a nice guy.
Can you give me some advice on how to get to the beach?
I'm being precise.
Time to go to bed.
You can do it.
Tom looks sick.
Tom went to bed.
I'm here to see Tom.
This problem is a real challenge.
Good morning, what a heavy rain.
Papa just came home from abroad.
You must be spending time.
Where are you going?
Yamamoto is one of my friends.
I'm going to fuck it up.
Oh, my God!
In time, their friendship turned into love.
Seriously?
He bought her a dog.
It rained yesterday.
I got cold.
John is my old friend.
They keep the plan a secret.
Tom has taken off his socks.
Ken wants a bicycle.
Tom grows mustaches.
I don't need to.

People learn more by trying to fix a TV than by watching it.
When the rain is over, we'll leave.
He never speaks badly of others.
Tom is here yet?
I don't need this.
I wish we could meet.
I've put your dinner in the oven.
Just a minute.
The station is 10 minutes away by car.
I'll see you the day after tomorrow.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom has done nothing wrong.
Tom swims really fast.
How should we view this problem?
Don't apologize to me.
Tom quit smoking.
Yes, I did.
I like reading more than watching TV.
I'm gonna have to break the eggs to make an egg.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The man standing there is the owner of the store.
Tom, where have you been?
You know where she lives?
Can I have a moment?
Don't apologize, Tom.
He started drinking after losing his wife.
You want to come?
It's pretty cold today.
Can we talk alone?
He likes the royal style.
The two men sitting on the bench were American.
They admired the beautiful scenery on top of the mountain.
The glass fell to the floor and broke to pieces.
I don't know. What if you asked Tom?
Tom takes the bus to work.
When they beat Tom, Mary ran out of the room.
I want to send this letter in writing.
Can I have a glass of milk, please?
She looks very young compared to her husband.
I have a credit card.
I borrowed money from a friend.
He fell off the horse.
He's a great athlete.
What's my fault?
I have to go now.
Thanks.I can't stand it.
I'd rather walk than take a bus.
Jack is reliable.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Can I hold your hand?
I'd like to meet your sister.
Water, please.
This is my bike.
Do you want to have a drink?
Tom went home and did his homework.
I'm gonna ask him about it tomorrow.
️Not all teachers behave like that.
He left her with his final farewell.
I wish you a speedy recovery.
Come back in a month.
We got lost on the way, but if it hadn't happened, I think we'd have gotten here quicker.
Why don't you believe me?
Where are we now?
I'm really tired.
We happen to have the same birthday.
I have a friend whose father is a famous actor.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Our train stopped suddenly.
I'm leaving now.
I have to go now.
Our team beat them 5-0 in baseball.

We'll have exams as soon as the summer vacation ends.
I agree with you.
Our dog is called Johnny.
If you buy me ice cream, I'll give you a kiss.
Tom fixed a bow to the flag.
You ever heard of the Loch Ness monster?
I'm so annoying with my little brown, I'm probably crazy.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's one of Japan's most important scientists.
You must find a decent job!
I've met that girl before.
I read the best book I can.
Let's try something.
It was cold last night, not to mention cold.
How old is your baby?
They admired the beautiful scenery from the hillside.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I have to go.
I have sore eyes.
What he said must be true.
What's your friend's name?
We are grateful for your help.
I'm sorry, the train was late.
Don't worry about it.
I was depressed all day.
I feel everywhere.
I like it!
I think I'm going to bed early tonight.

PDF
A minute.
It's none of your business.

Tom said that?
The clash between protesters and police turned violent.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm prepared for the worst.
There's nothing more precious than good nature.

Tom made the choice.
The truth alone is beautiful.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Why does it hurt when sweat comes into your eyes?
What would you like to drink?
I tried to open it, but no way.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is my first love.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
I brought some windshields, you want?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I spent the whole afternoon talking to my friend.
I have a reservation for three nights from tonight onwards.
He never does anything but joke.
You're bleeding from your nose.
Tom sat on the couch.
See you later.
I know Tom is sick.
Never seen a sunset this beautiful.
Can this meeting lead to anything?
I couldn't help but laugh.
Tom, on the phone.
Children playing!
I asked him if he got the letter I sent him.
That's weird.
Sit down.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That's all for today.
I've never met him before.
I haven't actually seen Tom and John fight.
Thank you so much for coming.
I was just too small to get under the car.
I agree with you on taxes.
Keep in touch!
The singer has a beautiful voice.
We've been in touch.
You win?
When my daughter was little, she had asthma attacks.
Are you hiding something?
Don't be sad.
Nobody likes war.
I wish we could meet.
I just woke up, so give me a minute and I'll get ready.
I have a new boyfriend, but my ex doesn't know about it.
He's not here anymore.
I go to church every day.
The problem is, will he or won't he?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He wishes that the unpleasant memories will be gone.
Where is the wedding?
Have you ever been to Africa?
He couldn't go outside because of the snow.
Tom retired at 65.
What time is it now?
I don't have a fork.
Everyone in Tunisia speaks French very well.
And then suddenly, my mother popped into the song.
It's snow white.
I want paper.
Soviet troops began to withdraw from Afghanistan.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You've lost weight.
Honestly, I don't want to work with him.
Talk to me!
How can I help you?
I'm looking for a present for my wife.
Can you tell me your birthday?
When did Tom arrive?
I'm free until 6:00 tonight.
You all right?
He was the only one who came to the party.
What a beautiful flower!
I'm sorry about that.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I can read English, but I can't speak it.
That's too much.
I'd buy that.
Doesn't he speak French?
I hear he's a professor at the University of Tokyo.
I'll help you.
How do you want your eggs prepared?
I don't speak French at all.
He represented the trade union in the committee.
Don't you remember what you said?
Turn on the radio.
I bought a watch.
Are we hiding?
Poems transform old words into something else.
Do you have a dog?
I'm all fired up.
Quiet, please.
Where's the station?
Tom bought a new camera.
It's 9:15 in the morning.

Be more calm.
What did you say?
Tom tampered with the report.
The boys are playing the thief and the police.
When the rain stops, we'll leave.
Do you have anything to tap on?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Come on, now!
I don't know what Tom is planning.
Can I drink all this?
He was very observant.
Can you give it to me?
Sometimes it hurts so much that I can't control my emotions.
It could lead to serious problems.
Never seen a movie so crappy.

I'm taking a couple of days off.
I got shot.
I don't want to be a mere housewife.
Talk to me!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When they meet, they fight without exception.
What do you want me to call you?
I need a kitchenette.
I'm wearing a green shirt.
Can you please not tell me about the cake?
Thank you for inviting me.
The Prime Minister's speech was meant to anger the opposition.

I'm using Firefox.
I'm really sorry.
You don't show each other.We're not the same.
You there?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Get out of here before they see you.
You ever heard of Nessie?
I'm a day late, but happy birthday.
Who are you going there with?
There's something wrong with the typewriter.
There's no justice in telling me that!
I don't want to see you.
I thought it was a joke.
Tom married at the age of thirty.
Are you a slave to your slaves?
I wish I'd asked you for advice.
When did you see Tom?
They talked all night.
Turn off the TV.
School is right across the street from my house.
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry I was late.
What would you like to study in university?
Where would you like to go?
Tom seems to have a lot of worries, so I let him be quiet for a while.
You write me a letter sometimes.
I'm wearing a green sweater.
To play the decoration well?
Can I have a glass of milk, please?
Lock the door.
They didn't take my opinion into account.
Don't disappear!
I like cake too.
What are you talking about?
He left a moment ago.
Tom bought a new multifunction printer.
He asked for help, but nobody came.
Can I borrow your phone?
Better late than never.
What would you like to drink?
Sometimes I think about getting a divorce.You can't be serious!
I was a monk all day.
I need Tom.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
He speaks Portuguese.
Even if I make a mistake, I'll try again.
What I like about Mary is her strength.
You think of Tom?
Can you bring your book down?
Can I have the bill, please?
I got my car stolen last night.
I went too.
Can you tell me how to get there?
I don't have any money.
I have to go now.
Let's pretend this never happened.
How old are you?
Can I come with you?Of course.
He's got a natural elegance.
Do we think about next year until next half?
I can't live like that.
I was on a bike.
I have other things to do on the 26th.
Tom is as cunning as a leopard.
Tom is looking for someone who can speak French.
Come home now.
Same-sex couples should be able to get married.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm the kind of guy who can see what's on his face right away.
They took my word.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When you start showing off your passport, you should go on vacation.
Sometimes I think about getting a divorce.You can't be serious!
Tom ran away from his life.
I feel like I wanna eat something.
I don't know.
Tom and Mary are both from Australia.
Do you know when Tom's birthday is?
Easy to get grass.
It's easy.
Go ahead, please.
Get you home.
Of course you are!
Turn off the lights.
When he had just turned 20, my father had a cerebral hemorrhage and was hospitalized.
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.
Tom is good at driving.
Get your hat off.
I've never eaten a mango before.
Cake with ants.
Can you turn off the lights?
I've been depressed all day.
I have to go.
You're trying to lure me?
Do you know why he's so angry with you?
He throws the ball hard.
Mari is the best singer in her class.
I'm sorry, I must have confused you somehow.
He's never been sick.
It's a pity Tom already ate.
He's very kind.
Hey, if dinner isn't ready by 7:00, I'm going to the restaurant.
The speaker's claim was unreasonable.
They have something in common.
I'm starting to run out of patience.
Are you sure?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom has rabbits.
Tom never had the chance to meet Mary when he was in Boston.
I saw a big peanut for the first time.
He checked the files carefully.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
Here's all the money I have.

Our mother says she wants a smartphone, but since she cannot use it, I consider buying for the joy of buying a smartphone a waste of money.
It's too hot.
I want to eat a steak.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Can you advise me to the station?
Mary likes to do things differently than others.
I think you like her.
Osaka is the second largest city in Japan.
I'm sure that shirt will suit you well.

I couldn't stop laughing.
Get the pen off the floor.
I never wanna see that man's fucking face again, so I ripped all the pictures of him and burned them.
I need to lose weight, so I'm on a weight loss tour.
Tom is down.
I'm very tired.
Thank you so much for coming.
Tom is a smart boy.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Tom admitted his defeat.
If I drink coffee, I can't sleep.
Tom is gone.
Calm down now.
I'm used to getting up early.
Tom lives in Boston.
I don't think it's weird at all.
I'm drunk with this.
Just kidding.
I'm weakening myself.
Do it and you'll be fired.
Tom is confused.
You're not hot?
The sky was a mess.
I got it.
He's a tough guy, which is why I like him.
I dreamed of being a real person.
Can I ask you something?
He was acting like a lunatic.
I like it when a professional gives me compliments.

They smiled at each other.
Leave it alone.
I took a cat from the neck.
Tom ate his stomach for his bottle.
He likes to climb mountains and is very familiar with the mountains of Japan.
How old were you when you believed in Santa Claus?
Tom has three sons.
That's not fair.
Do you know if the restaurant is open?
General clenched our hands.
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
Can you advise me to the station?
I met Tom this evening.
I'm going to ask Tom.
I'm a little busy.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom has friends all over the world.

What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
Tom swims.
Tom cannot tell the difference between expensive and cheap wine.
Rain hit the window.
Tom made his decision.
Mrs. Woods was a very good cook.
How did we win?
Of course you are!
I don't think that's weird.
He told his son that he wouldn't go to the movies with this.
Tom is as cunning as a leopard.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The more stubborn, the more independent.
I'm gonna have to start moving.
I like it very much.
He's still alive.
I was surprised to hear that.
What did you have for breakfast?
This is very rare.
Excuse me, but is there a ATM nearby?
Did you get what you wanted?
Why does she always speak ill of her own son?
Stop thinking of your own good, think of others and act on them.
What's the difference between a mini-cream and a micro-cream?
I laughed the second I saw him.
Tom is sharp.
What did you have for lunch today?
This movie is a wolf.
It's an easy trick.
I'm serious about this.
If you see a mistake, you can fix it.
Thank you, I'm going to ask the other people what they think.
I hope you finish the experiment.
Don't try to do two things at once.
Take this medicine after meals.
The situation worsened moment by moment.
Tom has a ham.
Let me try my cooking skills.
I'm just kidding around.
It's a little cold today.
Get him!
Thank you for your hard work.
I was being mean.
Tom accidentally laughed when he saw Mary dancing the gig.
Tom asked for help.
Put your seat belt on.
I'm having a nice day.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom crossed the road.
You've never been in love, have you?
I must admit it was my fault.
Whose book is this?
I don't know if this is important to you, but it is.
He usually takes the bus to school.
Without your help, I would have drowned.
I hear Ninni is really cute.
Give her some time.
When and where should we meet?
He started to tap on a nostalgic song.
I ran upstairs, so I'm breathing in.
I'll help you.
I have to take a shower.
Women observe and men think.
Sam, what are you doing?
Stop it!
Do I have to cut?
Do you love Tom?
I'm here to help people like you.
Eventually, the weather is good. I'm sure the laundry is getting dry today.
Have you drawn this yourself?
He's like a mirror of his father.
I don't know anything about those plans.
That's my CD, right?
I'm a Firefox user.
Do you speak English?
I need a cutter.
I'm not a teacher.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The curtain rose.
How do you get to school?
Thank you for inviting me.
The grass is greener on the other side of the fence.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
How much is this camera?
Let me try again.
Tom certainly doesn't know what Mary is going to do.
I'm just wondering if maybe Tom was the one who started the fire.
I don't have any money.
Hate me? E.  So love you?  Why do you ask?
From here to there in ten minutes.
Tom couldn't believe that nobody laughed at his jokes.
I saw Tom talking to Mary.
Tom was busy.
I'm tired of it!
Papa often goes to America for business.
Satoo practices archery on weekends.
Can someone tell me the principle behind the light bulb?
Behave yourself.
Tom is the oldest.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Speaking of traveling, have you ever been to New York?
It's really cold today.
I found his office.
You should be able to walk again in a couple of days.
I don't speak French at all.
You free?
Get in the house!
Tom hasn't come yet.
He didn't answer.
I'm getting hurt all over the place.
I want to emphasize this point.
You're lying to me.
I'm going to go quickly and raise money.
I've been trying to call him all day, but the number's always booked.
A high wall surrounds the garden.
Don't speak ill of them behind their backs.
He's actually over 70.
I don't speak very much English.
Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, an old man.
The dictionary is right next door.
School guards were always angry with each other.
Make yourself comfortable.
If I could use a computer, I might get paid more.
This is the first time I've seen a peanut this big.
I see no reason why I should apologize.
I don't need this anymore.
Don't give yourself credit.
I have to go now.
Tom had nothing to eat.
Take care of yourself.
Tom has cancer.
It's stupid to borrow money from a coroner.
What's up?The key is lost.What's the key?The bike.
I'm not used to walking long distances.
I wanna be here as long as I can.
That doll is scary.
Tom hasn't spoken to Mary in years.
It was one of the most important breakthroughs in science.
Today's math class was more fun than usual.
Stay down!

Tom got angry.
Do these dresses make me look fat?
Tom doesn't know what to say to make Mary happy.
I'm going to be late.
He's throwing a party next week.
I talk a lot to myself, but don't pay attention to it.
We were talking to each other when he came to interrupt.
Where are you going?
My son came in second last.
I admit my mistake.
I'm bored.
You'd better get going.
She lives in New York.
I have great respect for people who express their opinions directly.
Tom has a personal bodyguard.
Can I get a beer?
I'm looking forward to the summer.
Don't you have air conditioning?
Can I have a bill?
Tom's speech was good.
He eats breakfast here often.

I know Marko has been ill.
Show me where Puerto Rico is on the map.
I want to eat Chinese noodles.
Write your daily report today.
Tom is a lazy man.
Be careful you don't get the flu.
I like sushi.
Tom got sick because he ate too much.
Tom is crazy.
If I win the lottery, I can live as a prince.
Look after Tom.
It looks like Tom won that contest.
We trust you.

He just went outside.
I don't know what he's saying.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
She's a stubborn woman.
How do I know?
I'm grateful for your advice.
Why are you so angry?
Excuse me, can you give me some advice on the road?
Let me explain it with a photo.
This is a bad omen.
I suggest you take the train.
I can't take it anymore!Take it easy.
I have nightmares a lot.
Can you tell me your name?
Maybe tomorrow it will rain.
Which club are you in?
I didn't quite understand what you were saying.
I couldn't bear to go out tonight.
I haven't had enough to drink yet.
As soon as I can afford it, I'm gonna buy a new car.
I am a realistic person.

I've got a lot to do this afternoon.
You can come anytime.
I'm drinking after dinner.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
I'm sorry, but I'm just having a little work to do.

I don't know how to swim very well.
Tom is disappointed.
Have you got any plans for tonight?
Can I have a bill, please?
I'll be waiting for you.
Don't get mad at me!
I got a full set.
A ghost that was lost in the thick of the fog.
You're threatening me?
Study and not just watch TV!
How long are you staying here?
To make a reservation, you need to use his name.
They said he was the cause of the accident.
Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.

Please help me!
The room needs to be absolutely clean.
Tom is a huge information buff.
We're going to church tonight.
When the land is left to mourn, the rich goose leaves the land easily.
Can you mail this letter as a flight mail?
I like football.
I wish there was a white Christmas this year. Well, that's it.
I love eating him.
I forgot my number.
Do I look fat in this dress?
I know what Tom is doing here.
He's in a lot of trouble.
Today is Tuesday, right?
Tom is watching TV right now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Please sit down.
We just got a visitor. Can you hold on a second?
I'm mad at you.
The tulipans are in full bloom now.
That's a fact that's clear to everyone.
I don't know this town very well.

Stop it!
I didn't remember your birthday this year, did I?
There are many good things about our plan.
I almost died a year and a half ago.
There's a bank in front of the station.
He sees it as an effort to work for the well-being of his own people.
Where are you going?
Excuse me, where can I find eggs?
Of course you do, but you also did some other things before you met here.
I'll make you an offer.
You're lying!
I tried to concentrate on reading.
Oh, my God!
I've been studying science all along.
The author will be publishing a new work next month.
I wanna know if we're alone.
I can't stand this hot weather anymore.
I'm really busy these days.
Recently, meat has become very expensive.
How did you get these rare books?
This has nothing to do with you.
Then you have to make sure the iron is hot.
Can you speak French?
He opened the door.
Tanakou  called me when you were gone.
I was a kid.
Who doesn't work doesn't eat.
I agree with you.
Let's just leave the formalities to the fullest.
Tom asked a stupid question.
How old is your dad?
The missing cat hasn't been found yet.
Hello, are you Jackie Scott?
She wanted to be a singer.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
I don't like to sing in front of people.
Place of your seat!
I was just kidding.
Tom lit a candle with a flashlight.
Lisa's room needs cleaning.
How would we solve this problem?
I was speechless.
The candle went out of its own way.
Tom called Mary.
What did you think of San Francisco?
Do you know where Tom went to hide?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'll never forget your kindness.
Is this a natural expression?Let's ask the teacher on Google.
Once my sultan ruled today's Turkey.

Can we have dinner outside tonight?
I live in Boston.
Can you close the door?
That's a great idea!
I didn't order this.
I told you not to smoke in your room.
I suspect he is ill.
He treats me like a child.
Are you in Australia for the first time?It's the first time I've been here.
You must obey your parents.
I can walk at least two miles.
This is your first time abroad?
That's a good idea.
Proper exercise will boost blood circulation.
I agree with you in essence.
Tom lost his credibility.
This afternoon is an English test.
The concert was a success.
Do you come here often?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I hate jealous women.
Don't put anything on that box.
It's whitish.
Where are you going?
Tom is a good man.
I don't want to work with him.
How would we solve this problem?
What kind of people spend their time in a place like this?
I'm in the bathroom right now.
I saw Tom tonight.
Tom works in Boston.
What's up? Well, that's when I'd like the bushes to grow.
I like it very much.
I'm sorry, I was just looking for Loretta.
You've obviously done this before.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom waved his hand.
You'd better go to the doctor for a medical check.
Marie is the most beautiful girl in her class.
It's raining.
I love her so much, I could die.
When are we gonna be there?
How's your work?
I think that's a good idea.
Slowly, slowly.
He's very aggressive.
Japan drives on the left side of the road.
He can play guitar.
What's wrong with you?
Yooko is in London now, studying English.
I was completely stunned when I saw him.
Tom's house burned.
