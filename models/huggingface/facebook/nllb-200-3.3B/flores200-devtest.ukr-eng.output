Not only does this support the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also reports details that fossils could not provide  such as color and three-dimensional imagery.
The researchers say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed stem, called the rachis, but have other features of the feathers - fangs and whiskers - the researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved much later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or for beauty, and the researchers suggest that although this is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than feathers of a shrimp.
The researchers suggested that although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult plumage, not the plumage of a baby.
A car bomb detonated outside a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, early yesterday, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a Daesh (ISIS) militant was behind the attack.
They concluded that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it turns out that the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the number of Rossby stars that are associated with the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the change in magnetic field.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was created to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally not a high-tech process: voters go in one by one and put a pre-printed piece of paper with their candidate's name on it into an envelope.
After the officials have identified the voter, he drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs his name on the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict in encrypting the proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting, and no envelopes are added except those put in by duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the process.

He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to the Addenbrook Clinic in Cambridge.
Adekoya was brought before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the testimony of any witness could be challenged as her photo has been published frequently.
In other parts of the UK, this is common practice, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have seen the publication of the photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to be taking a dangerous path by sharing photos and other information about suspects".
The prosecutor's office, which is generally in charge of the prosecution, told reporters that it would not provide any further comment, at least until charges are brought.
This document, according to the leaked information, will refer to the conflict over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other subjects likely to be covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to keep such a presence for only five years.
The hunters in the auxiliary pest control had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, as the hunt was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In partnership with the SPS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (SSAA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Heritage Conservation Service, the four shooters selected for the first shoot-out operation have been given proper safety instruction and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
This is the fifth by-election for the Martelli Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous TPC as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been delayed since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods, which have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METP) said it was aware of 27 emergencies involving these devices.
Last week, the IETF announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "a great disappointment".
The quake struck at 7:19 a.m. local time in Mariani (around 9:19 p.m. on Friday in Greenwich).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management reported that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six hostages are reported dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced the old lady, as she needed to use the toilet.
Lyggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynaecologist and went on to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that the introduction of the hormone accelerated the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, state investigators recovered two onboard boxes.
Fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died in the night two months. Quite unique as she is. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Moon was as much a wreck as I am...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
From 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
If we look at the categorical responses to the survey, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and take part in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts were raised over his fitness.
He could not take painkillers, as they are prohibited during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number.
Some people confirmed the discovery with various gadgets and PCs before the beginning of February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water and organic matter, which could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have been colliding with the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political babble and nonsense".
There's talk that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the more obsolete technology of ground-based radar, which enables air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport is launched and no overland trains stop at Wembley, and car parks and overtaking car parks will not be available on the surface.
Fears of a lack of transportation forced the team to consider a closed-door game without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of birds on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's hedgehog, Geospis fortress, and the cactus's gland-imitator, Geospis conyrostris.
Gold can be shaped in many different ways, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be made into a fine wire that can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using the juice of a red clove.
The juice of the gourd changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The level of acidity is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen  ions are protons that have lost their electrons (as hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by rolling them in a container, then with clean wet hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, providing an unusual sensation and forming a shell-like structure.
Toilets connected to an elaborate sewerage network were in almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Remnants of sewerage systems have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in use in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths, where men and women would be together in mixed companies.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light and what we see.
It takes a solid rocket at least 100 feet high to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the biggest thing it has done for us is make it much easier and faster to transport.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below are a larger number of medium-sized cats that feed on medium game  from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (especially free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on numerous small prey species such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of the niche - the special position that each cat occupies and which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, and they live in large groups called pride.
The pride consists of one to three adult male parrots, as well as up to thirty females and their young.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave much like wolf packs or dogs - animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and equally dangerous to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for great distances, and strike five times harder than a man can.
Tigers are in the same group (the Panther genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar, but more like a confused roar.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and trace prey by scent, looking for their scent on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and they also move very quietly, hunting their prey by hiding in their surroundings and then jumping out at their prey unexpectedly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
In this new environment, other resources and other rivals, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger rival than it was before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all -- they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans expel (exhale).
Plants cook food from the sun by photosynthesizing it. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasauri.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth along with their extra set of upper jaw, meaning that no one who got in its way would be able to escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a tongue, that he had turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus could not compete with it.
The Romans ate mostly what we know, but they also had their own strange and unusual banquets, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and wolves.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy men enjoyed communal banquets, where they rested while eating on their sides.
Ancient Romans could not have had access to the products that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each god, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then the inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers were built as part of temples and were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were no longer so important.
Most of the life of this Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyards; shops were the usual open-air stalls facing the street; houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Old Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Nation, you might think that the treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it's not true, and even though there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words "Original of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is found at the bottom of the document and is reversed.
There is no information about its author, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (it measures 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was preserved in a folded state.
Thus, it is quite possible that the entry was added simply as a label.
As a result of the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
They were ruled by the French Vichy, who had made a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, and this landing was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the "France Fighting" movement liberated the south of France and marched on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture of a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "civil", which refers to the Latin word civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also determines the size of society in some way.
City-states can be seen as the precursors of nations. Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint, and even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, and so are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government  Congress was its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the authority to impose taxes, and in the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state agencies, which often failed to cooperate in the enforcement of all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The articles required uniform permission from all the states before their amendment, and the states did not take the central authority so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with Germany, and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Sports such as football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing are widely known.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" because of the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
The origins of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century, when European navigators, sailing along, recorded the name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a branch in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Wiccons.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the beginning.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most common format for still photographic images is 35 mm, which was the dominant format in the late analogue era of photographic film.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit of a knock off the ribbon, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the API family of formats) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The often used and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
According to it, the most effective place to place the main object is the intersection of the lines that divide the raster into three thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity held the European powers together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should combat suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are for that.
The central body of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the church really was following this principle.
Shortly after the sudden onset of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, and although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms, codified by several international treaties over the last two centuries, it cut off vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain extracted minerals in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing moods of most citizens and nations.
Realizing the horrors and cruelty of the First World War, the nations were determined to prevent such a thing from happening again.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States of America, in order to apply for a position with Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Butchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were depicted in a unique way; each stage of the country's development was each ruling family becoming a prominent dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable age of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Sangō Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
These were times of bitter warfare between many of the nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history  Thousands of people died in battles for the throne in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state is the property of the people rather than of a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all willing men, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of the military ranks being based on class, they were now based on quality.
The French Revolution also inspired many representatives of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond this worldly life, and he often visited the cave that became known as "Hira", on Mount "Nur" (light) for his meditations.
The cave itself, which has survived to our day, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually quite difficult to find, even if you know it's there, and when you go into a cave, you're completely isolated.
You can see nothing but a clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramids built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward" notation looks like a "V", and the "downward" notation looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the head and push the lever, and down means you have to start at the pegs (where your hand is holding the lever) and pull the lever.
The upward movement of the hammer usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the hammer is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to add your own markings with a pencil, but be aware that the markings printed on percussion instruments have a certain meaning, so they usually need to be taken into account.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of women from the market chased King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, from Versailles and forced them to return to Paris.
In a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a mob of mobs and threatening the king and queen.
The york forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the gang waved the beheaded head of a royal guard guard at Versailles.
The military expenditure of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay a large part of the costs and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, become the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era in which these events occur is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Classical Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended about 1500.
Technological determinism  is a concept that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or technological imperative to the idea that human destiny is strictly dictated by a basic logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology as such follows a path that is largely beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are more inevitable than socially conditioned.
For example, one might argue that a machine necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unviable for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed that allow to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare methods to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism has borrowed a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these, while in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being the epicenter of luxury, which dates back to about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its position deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the people of the east were strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 or 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the time was the use of the cross-hat to attach clothes.
Non-commodity agriculture  Agriculture that aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the owner and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses prepared seeds from plants native to a particular ecoregion, combined with grass seed and other comparatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced organic farming, and this still persists in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel disregarded by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be defined by age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion items, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to take a few stories of poor children who grew up in neglect, misfortune or intentional cruelty, and were not socialized as adults.
Such children are called "jungle children" or wild ones, and are often held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents leave children at the mercy of their parents' disapproval of the parents' severe mental or physical disabilities.
It may be that the feral children were the victims of cruel treatment or suffered serious injuries before they were abandoned or escaped.
Some were said to have been raised by animals; others were said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves much the same way (within the limits of physical capability) as the corresponding caring animals, for example, treating people with fear or indifference.
And while design technology should make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a help provided to individuals who are learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher acts as the architecture, like the little human-like box in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to ask, suggest and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to learn on their own.
Children are given to foster families for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up without care, attention, and education, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system should be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system includes safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care system is supposed to provide everything that they lack in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as significant motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Egmi and McCord (1998) when they studied audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions  facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who are unable to understand language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately determine sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have such abilities in interpreting human behavior.
A 20th-century study showed that there are two types of genotypic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection picks it out of the pool of variations that have been expressed.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reserves with each generation.
For primates with a digestive system like ours, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins in the leaves and beans, but these are difficult to digest by primates like us if we don't cook them.
In contrast, animal foods (e.g., ants, termites, eggs) are not only well digested but also provide a substantial amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all these things, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors were solving the "protein question" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption  is the process of purposefully awakening during a normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short interval of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your watch in your sleep, it can be placed at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking large amounts of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces you to urinate.
The degree of inner calmness that a person has is the exact opposite of the level of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force there is, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that can stop us from achieving this goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened from the postures of yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deities, which through visualization of the various deities, cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and forms the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. As the war ended, conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to these countries falling out.
Two years had passed since the end of the war, and the former allies had become enemies, leading to the beginning of the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and real battles were fought between the armies of countries on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans were overturned almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Peace of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the USSR and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using submarines as the main means of transport, tried to stop the movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that moved over hills and other pastures, and were tended by goat herders, often children or teenagers, better known as shepherds.
The causeway was built in England as early as the 16th century.
And although the dirt roads were essentially two parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses working on them to develop greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged conventional roads of the time.
Slabs were introduced to hold the rail in place early on, but it gradually became clear that the rail would be more effective if iron reinforcements were placed on top of it.
This became common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first known movement was walking, people started walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright, as they usually do.
Bipedalism is found in fossil Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although sachelianthrops may have started walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it is merely a symptom-based treatment, but if we are not looking for a temporary solution, then we should look for the root cause of the problem and address it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have increased because of human overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, the handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlepp's printing press, located a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150-200 copies were made, now known as the "Broadleafs of Dun".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters are now known to be the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have a lot of dinosaur stuff.
Their feet have scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all the computers that we use today are powered by information processing encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In a binary numbering system, there can only be one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to diagnose at once.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open bottle of a medicinal product or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label for specific first aid recommendations for this particular poison.
Formally, entomologists describe this group of insects as bugs.
This term is a reflection of our centuries-old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both cone and bed bugs are nesting insects adapted to life in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged and younger people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women have twice the risk of MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
Such parents may decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption involves the removal of parental rights from the biological parents so that the other couple can raise the child.
The whole point of science is to find out, by scientific method, how the world works, and that method really drives most of the scientific research.
Although it's not just experimentation, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic factors, are found in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock  is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue a period of the cycle that is freely executed even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment became one of the main hypotheses in the question of whether DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of a bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of a bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material, and whether the cells involved are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells are passed on to the children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, and also getting new information about them.
Each morning, people leave small provincial towns in their cars to get to their workplaces, and other people who work in the places they have just left drive past them.
In this dynamic transportation back and forth, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Now science notes that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its steady state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
All of us live in communities and use transportation systems, yet not all of us complain about them.
You don't hear that in developed countries, where people complain about the quality of the water or the bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems suffer such problems and fail daily? Is it because transportation engineers are incompetent? or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow  is the definition of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behavior of a driver with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner; thus, traffic flows tend to have some sort of logical sequence, and may have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of transport, the relationship was established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and maintenance of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This opens up a wider range of small hiding places for them to hide from predators.
Now the only insects that can't fold their wings are butterflies and unicorns.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems rational because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, and it holds eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes as much as 6 miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main watershed is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the structures of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the least populous.
In its legislation and official communication, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
Italian is also the language of everyday communication for most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in native forms, and they are quite easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are usually a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that will include non-metallic elements, like carbon in small amounts.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of these particles could fit into a dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, since its appearance, the pencil has been a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods were developed, the pencil's status and use were diminished.
People now type messages on a computer screen without having to go anywhere near a scrubber.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like when something new is invented.
The atomic bomb works by conserving energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like boiling a heavy iron upwards, and splitting the core releases some of that energy back.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no thrust.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The lunar crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the moonlit seas and thicker under the high mountains.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner, and the lava was easier to get to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people tick or what makes them tick.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were taken over by them in the process of adulthood.
These theories cover certain people and what makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment make them do or not make them do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can occur when managers start to manage their former colleagues: on the one hand, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has problems with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, allocating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable personality who feels that he has to change everything that the team has done and do it his way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact with their immediate real-world group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet across time zones, which may be confusing to their local managers.
The presence of a true "invisible collective" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual collective.
The "invisible team" is a management group to which all members report.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of implementing an organizational learning that is so time-consuming?
When all available resources are efficiently used across functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result of the process of the organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process to meet the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities, and in this way, they narrow the field of research and make it more precise.
Scientists in their studies support the relationship between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injury, injury, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI forms a very important subdivision of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation.
In AI research, machines are forced to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer assessments and questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
These things became separate disciplines, focused on solving real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been incorporated into several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual classroom activities, where students can look at museum artifacts or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
A virtual tour  is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capitol; the website is reworked each year, but older versions are kept online as an album.
Blogging can also help improve a student's writing skills. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "stimulates students to a better awareness of the world around them".[33] The need to satisfy the interest of the audience motivates students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn well outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' articles, as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's beautiful bilingual capital, is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and modernity.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and further north is the pristine natural beauty of Mosco and beyond.
All of these things and more are highlighting in Ontario what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wildlife.
A comparison that may surprise some: the United States has more African Americans than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest, and is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it was strongly established in the Komors and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around Europe's Cape of Good Hope to India.
To the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel region, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All women travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also wise to wear a heel (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what you would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of your husband and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The present city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt and named Casa Branca, and in 1755 after an earthquake left it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou-i-Badia, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as taji, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east, next to Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, any travel outside Goma should be preceded by a study of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
It is also the base for the climb of Mount Nyiragongo and one of Africa's cheapest gorilla viewing sites.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Because of this, and the relative inaccessibility, the name "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990, it was included on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stops during the PBS reporting of Henry Louis Gates' African Miracles of the World.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab than African color.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which holds different wildlife.
It is one of the major landmarks of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily fee for security and admission.
Some may also benefit from a Wild Card, which entitles them to access some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place of special interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the architectural face of Hong Kong has been compared to the glittering histogram that is manifested by the presence of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite side of the port of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated in the swampy area along the northern coast.
This is a place that was appropriated by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Subar is the world's largest coastal strip of mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, for they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer now live in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumalang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days before the trip.
Most areas are served by the small Japanese Koster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
A route taxi is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The Oiapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the Oiapok River and the city of Oiapok in Brazil to the town of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapok in French Guinea.
The bridge is 83 metres high, 378 metres long, and has two car lanes, each 3.50 metres wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres (49 ft) and was completed in August 2011 but not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned to open the bridge fully in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who sometimes engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors clashed with indigenous groups to form Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indians".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here and at other times of the year.
Contact the Argentine Polo Association for news on tournaments and ticketing for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is set at a value equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted at any point on the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley credit cards and US dollars.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British or United States currency may be accepted; check with owners in advance to determine what is acceptable payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency abroad, so please exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and moisture combined make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild, so they do not need to be fed or cared for.
According to park officials, keep at least 100 yards [100 yards] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 yards] from all other wild animals!
Humble as they may seem, the bison, the great deer, the moose, the bear, and almost all the other large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so take along and avoid making a spicy jam, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour became the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, with the loss of about 200 Americans and Germans.
During the independence movement organized by the Mao movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader of the Topa, Tamaseze Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between two harbors.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe to navigate, and most are shaded by trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Helius in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with many small shops along the coastline.
The main local beer, "Number One"  is simple but pleasant and refreshing.
You can taste a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines may be more transport-resistant.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of "flat-white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians; Short Bléc is "espresso", cappuccino is made with bitter cream (not with foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets the requirements of Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are not cheap at all, but they are beautiful.
Many trips to the reef occur year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the authorities, observe all signs, and pay particular attention to the danger warnings.
The cubomedusa is found near beaches and riverbanks from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally in other months.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean, their main natural habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often work with specific hotels, although you can try booking something else with them, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can also keep a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your trip (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should still first go through the travel agency, not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of music event attendees choose to stay overnight, and for most attendees, this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to come early to take a seat closer to the stage.
Remember, even if the music on the main stages has stopped playing, there may be sections at festivals that will play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the cabin layout, because traveling through the ice makes a pretty awful sound if you're very close to the source.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city.
Casinos generally make a great effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and on the premises.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but getting drunk can affect your judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high-latitude or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and it is not permissible to drive on bare asphalt.
During storms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to become trapped in it.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow, or by water or ice buildup on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues unimpeded year-round.
The safari is perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction, attracting many visitors.
The term safari is generally used to refer to a trip by land to enjoy the incredible African wilderness, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, so standard equipment will allow them to be well-viewed.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, and they are best observed through binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "bush walk", "backwood safari" or "backwood" trip) is a hike of several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in various locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked airfare and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation schedules vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation schedules have not been extended until July 2020  the time for which the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a rented washing machine and a washing board, even if they are not available in the room.
If you don't have a comb, or you don't like to wear a comb sock, then you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause clotting, or in extreme cases, decay).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
Some places boil water for a minute; others require several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you have problems, consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals unknown in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often passes through an isolated forested meadow.
If you are unfamiliar with country roads, note that they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow paths, and steep curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, though, the cell phone connectivity here is much better than on many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and Bavarian is quite rich and varied, similar to the pastry of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pie is quite common: apples are used in the pie all year round, and cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts, and the popular pastries often taste especially good with a strong coffee.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try what is called "Berliner", "Pfannkuchen" or "Krapfen" depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally added to curry; in South India and occasionally in other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses the wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the nation.
But when used without further specifications, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very common throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply seasoned dishes, among which the predominant flavors are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
The -strings are the supports for the rider's saddle, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be dangerous because of the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck in them.
If a rider throws a horse and the leg gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may run and pull it. To reduce the risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with padded and smooth, fairly narrow soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially the English, have a safety device that will cause the saddle to fall off with the belt if the rider pulls the saddle back.
The Cochamo Valley, with its variety of granitic high rises and cliffs, is the main climbing area in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America.
Climbing involves admiring breathtaking views from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes amid the endless potential of the walls.
Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding  a popular sport that involves riding down a slope covered in snow on skis or snowboards that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the major tourist activities, with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski vagabonds", planning their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings, dating back to 5000 BC, depict skiers!
The sport of alpine skiing was established as early as the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backpacking, ski tourism, or skiing.
This is related to, but usually does not include, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is performed on steep slopes and requires the use of more rigid skis and shoes.
Consider the skiing route similar to the tourist route.
If the conditions are good, you can travel a lot farther than you can on foot  but it's really rare that you can reach the speed of a cross-country ski without a heavy backpack on well-traveled routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visa and passport controls.
However, the Schengen area in this sense acts as if it were a single country.
By staying in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to obtain visas separately for each of the Schengen countries, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique, and some tax agencies characterize goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition varies depending on the geographical location  the age limit in North America, for example, may be lower than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Deer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important to many who have other professions.
Even traditionally not all Sami engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived off fishing, hunting, etc., keeping reindeer usually as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people are employed in modern trade, and tourism in Sappim, where the Sámi people live, is a significant source of income.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among the Roma, it is considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of these people.
If the country you are about to visit is subject to government travel advice, this may affect your travel health and travel insurance.
You may also want to consult the governments of countries other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face situations that are different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Newsletters provide only brief information about the political situation in the country.
The data presented is often superficial, generalized, and very simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, cause serious social upheaval, or kill people.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and they come in different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all types of weather effects, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include snowstorms, tornadoes, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of adverse weather conditions in their area, as they may affect their travel plan.
Any person planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
A search of the "Environmental Courses" on the Internet will likely yield the address of a local business.
Usually, all the issues that are discussed here are covered in much more detail in the course, usually with practical lessons.
Typically, the course lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid exercises, and sometimes fire training.
Books and magazines about desert survival are common, but there are few publications about the war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should be sure that they have valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender is varied.
The willingness of foreign governments to consider such documents also varies widely.
Search of checkpoints also became more serious in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not had surgery should not expect to pass through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Reverse currents are the back-flows from waves that break on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and there can be a fast flow into deep water.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion from trying to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, the swimming back is no more difficult than it is.
Try to head for a place where you won't be caught up in the current again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it may be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Those who have had no difficulty adjusting to a new culture may find it especially difficult to adjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first set foot in a foreign land, people may have been patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler needs to adjust to his new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are as necessary for travelers when returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most exciting activities for the children of the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
You're always hearing the sounds of tourists and merchants, and the history of sound and light is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The pyramids are scenes, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and claimed by several countries, have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villas Estrellas.
Among others, Livingston Island and Descepcion Island, where a flooded caldera of an still active volcano lies at the base of a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here into a plateau, then reemerge, forming the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica: the Vinson Massif and Vinson Peak, reaching an elevation of 4,892 m (16,029 ft).
In remote areas, without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be out in the open with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used on vessels, including cruise ships and expeditions, that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider should provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning an academic vacation is travel and study.
This practice is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during your academic leave can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Usually, these educational programs are paid.
Finland  is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands, both in lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to sail around the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with seven to seven people on a boat.
This compares with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is generally quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most of these notable Baltic Sea cruises are characterized by a long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days in the historic site, returning to the ship for the night.
When you go ashore only on boat trips, you do not need a separate visa (valid as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany, as shown on the map above, far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced traumatic events.
It is nothing to be ashamed of; it is no different from the personal fears or disgust that so many people have for other things.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight may help to overcome a fear of flight that is based on ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things, and time is often very important when it comes to delivering business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes, smaller companies have a problem.
If they were to send things by air, some routes would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to do that quickly was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and here's your exit.
To fly first or business class, of course, you must pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: you can usually expect to pay 4 times the standard economy fare for business class and 11 times the first class fare!
In general, on direct flights from point A to point B, there is no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats.
Airlines know that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the ultimate price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a premium for that.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million people, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, busy commercial center, surrounded by a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers intersect with traditional red-brick houses, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches, though the city's atmosphere is more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldorsvik overlooks the nearby island of Estroy and also has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, some tombs are decorated with interesting marble sculptures of doves.
The intriguing village is worth at least a half-hour's walk.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became widely known to foreigners after the enthusiastic review of its splendor by Lord Byron.

Please treat this place with the dignity, the solemnity and the respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not tarnish the site by painting or graffitiing on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, with almost half of the population preferring to speak Catalan, the vast majority understanding it, and almost all speaking Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, and unplanned failures are reported automatically in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be egotistical, rude, and conceited.
In general, it's nothing more than a false stereotype, but the best way to get around in Paris is to behave like a person of the "bien élevé" (good upbringing) and make the trip much easier.
The harshness of the Parisian will soon be overcome if you show a little common respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly of beech, pine and spruce trees and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptional variety of plant crops due to its different microclimates and soil types, as well as variable altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Here you can find rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and the mule, as well as many other well-known species.
During visits to monasteries, women are expected to wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give cloaks to women who come unprepared, but if you come with your own, especially brightly colored ones, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
They can also be borrowed from the storage area at the entrance, but the clothes are not changed after each user, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing these clothes.
The cuisine of Majorca, like similar Mediterranean cuisines, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is the Pa-Amb-Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna and more.
All nouns, along with the word Sie meaning you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It's an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
This may also make it easier to read, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether the verb or the adjective is used in the noun form.
The Italian language is relatively simple, with most words pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation differs depending on the vowels that follow.
Also, make sure you pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, and carro  is a chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally correct grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Needless to say, if you know Romance, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people who have some knowledge of Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is quite similar to it and does not need to be learned separately.
Today, ancient observatories are generally obsolete, functioning as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they tend to be located in cities or on campuses, and they're easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern telescopes for scientific research are huge objects in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festival was held by the emperor at the Imperial Palace for himself and other members of the aristocracy.
Plants look best in the wild, so resist the temptation to destroy even a single specimen.
If you visit an official landscaped garden, the collection of "samples" will also result in an unconditional banishment.
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place and very easy to navigate, where you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both the heat (always) and the scorching sun (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is a tradition to spend the night without sleeping in some open place to see the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter service on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and the faithful often begin the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first came to the islands were either brought here by water or by air.
The great distance from the mainland prevented the mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the principal grazing animal in the Galapagos.
After man arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs, appeared.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will discover the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a great opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky will be more or less dark throughout the day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The standard business form of clothing is suits. Employees address each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the work environment is emphasized, and the efforts of the group are valued above personal achievements.
