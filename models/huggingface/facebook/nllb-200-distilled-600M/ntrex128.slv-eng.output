Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they are like the Muppet
Some members of the Assembly are alarmed by the proposal to rename themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, i.e. Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are worried about getting laughed at.
A Labour MP said he was worried about their group because the name is a pun on Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means cockey.
A Plaid Cymru MP said that their group as a whole was satisfied and suggested other options.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: The final decision on possible descriptors for Assembly members will of course have to be made by the members themselves.
The Welsh Assembly was given the power to change its name by the Government of Wales Act 2017.
The Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals in June and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission chose the name Welsh Parliament Member or WMP for the members of the Assembly, but the most support was given to the MWP option in public consultation.
The members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but getting the consensus will be a difficult task for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who must submit a draft legislation on the amendments in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on incompatibility of the functioning of Assembly members and the establishment of a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly shall participate in the legislative debate in the final vote on their nomination.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
They want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its request for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay for EU-NATO accession.
The bells in St. Martin's have been ringing as the churches in Harlem face problems.
"The older people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
There's no one today.
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
People are different nowadays.
The bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms that people regularly visit.
But he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect and that they will soon be back at work.
He added that churches could be replaced with condominiums, where people who would not help the shelters in the remaining neighborhoods would live.
"The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore the day will soon come when all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that people who will move into these condominiums will become members of these churches".
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became the Black metropolis of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist church community emigrated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that held worship services nearby.
St. Martin's took over the Black religious community led by the Honorable John Howard Johnson, who at 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of salesmen who refused to employ or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishes planned to rebuild it, they ordered the bells to be hung.
Honorable David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the bells "Bells for the Poor".
The expert who tied them up in July called them a little differently: cultural treasure and irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who 18 years ago went to Riverside Church, where he bells larger ones.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced at St. Martin's Church.
In the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has been the subject of a complex story with architects and contractors; some brought by church laity, others by the bishop.
In July, the parish's governing body, consisting of lay people, wrote to the diocese, saying it was concerned that the diocese would try to transfer costs to the diocese, even though the diocese was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
A 13-year-old was injured by a stray dog while hunting lizards in California.
Officials report that a 13-year-old was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday in California during a locust hunt during the opening of the locust hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then he and his group swam to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lizard, but then he realized that the screaming bit me!
He bit me!
When he reached the boy, Hammel noticed that his whole wrist was torn.
"I called out to all of them to come out of the water, "and there was a shark in the water".
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescue worker, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be an endangered species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe upper torso injuries.
The authorities have blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamis Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beautiful corners they have in the supermarket and with the expert staff.
As part of the entry into the UK beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing as clothing and home appliances sales fall, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country and in more stores next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets were looking for ways to fill shelves that they used to fill for TVs, microwave ovens and household appliances.
Sainsburys says it will double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products and for the first time include brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing offer of LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of cosmetics, so that most vegan products are something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opening at Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
With online shopping and the daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local shops, supermarkets must do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsburys, said retail stores will be similar to wholesale stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl's discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsburys has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also Habitat stores since buying both chains two years ago, which has increased food sales and made the takeovers more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to refurbish its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments have failed.
Sainsburys engaged in a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the partnership ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsburys sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan as it was to expand the range of luxury skincare brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsburys, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty corners, thus improving the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to advise.
Our brand offerings are designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an interesting beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is angry that Holly Willoughby has pulled out of the £11 million deal.
The star of Dragons Den is furious that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of the £11 million lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly clothing and accessories brand.
The business couple's company has been compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered the Dragons star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Various sources say Jones was furious when the golden girl of television on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to his new business worth up to £1.5 million he no longer had enough time to look into their clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted that it would double its assets, valued at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of her vacation homes.
Sources say, "Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long-term future, a future she would live on for the next two decades.
Her decision to retire has completely stunned everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening because the opening was so close.
The company's headquarters in Marlow has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most exciting banking associations, would cost the company millions of dollars due to massive investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional opening delays.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife Taro Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together, and Jones also owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S's brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not going to comment on his business matters".
♪ We had a hard conversation ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He mocked media criticism for comments that some felt were "unpredecessory" and positive views about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up like that?
Trump, in his ridiculously journalistic voice, said:
I didn't give up on anything.
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in a second meeting, their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leader at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "comprehensive response" by the US to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead the US continued to impose sanctions, which they continue to press.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
But now we have a good relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results. They stopped missile testing, helped free hostages and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It can be hard to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded, crowded scene, we have 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds
For example, when dealing with the effects of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lusaka has been displaced, they have not declared a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
In many cases, they have been very clear that they do not require international assistance, so the situation is a bit complicatedSumbung said.
Save the Children has a team to travel to Palma, but it is unclear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau and were determining whether to allow international agencies to help.
Since earthquakes in Indonesia are constant, the country remains completely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not common practice on other coasts.
The loss of life was probably due to the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palo Alto, although the warning was in effect.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands, even at the best of times, presents a challenge.
Natural disasters have made logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship to assist victims of the Lombok earthquake is sailing towards Palo, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put improving the destroyed infrastructure of Indonesia at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial shortage is a problem for Jok's administration in re-election next year.
Joko is also facing long-standing tensions among sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hit for the late draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London by scoring in the 89th minute.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's pass 25 yards ahead of Chelsea's goal to put his team 1-0 behind.
He put the ball to his left and fired a shot at the remote gate.
The bullet traveled high above the penitentiary to the upper right corner of the door.
The ball finally dropped through goalkeeper Cape Arrizabalage and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always pull it forward as much as they can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn't think much more and just decided to shoot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime with a 25th-minute kick from Belgian Eden Hazard.
In this action, the blue-forward gave the ball back to Mateo Kovacic with the fifth and made his way into Liverpool's half.
The coin fell in the middle and ran forward.
Then he gave a nice pass through the defense and Hazard ran into the penitentiary.
Hazard overtook the defense and fired his left foot at a remote gate through Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are due to play a Europa League videotone on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state disaster agency reported Sunday morning.
A spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a large number of people were trapped in the collapse of buildings due to Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which triggered a six-meter wave.
Palá, with a population of more than 380,000, is dotted with buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling everyone in the area who saw or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I call on anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on camera, to contact us, as they may have information that is critical to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are underway, and the police are informing the women's relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told it may take hours before they can re-enter.
The officer was heard explaining to the man that the entire area is now treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying it's so terrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another one just outside it.
Several police officers were standing inside the cordon, watching the apartment block.
Anyone with any information should write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 dated 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest memorial to the debate over the rewrite of history.
Its removal would be the poetic right to destroy many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical Puritanists.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "a foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In today's discussion on the removal of the statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
Iconicism in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor of the last century.
The brilliant presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell testifies to a 19th-century view and is part of a historical record of a personality that some believe is still worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more so in the late 19th century than today) as the protector of Parliament from external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
Clearly, the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time when Lord Protector were also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
A pig killer has stabbed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only as Yuan was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pig market in the city of Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig herd is preparing for pig vaccination at a pig farm in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
She and her cousin reportedly traveled from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the next pig's barn was open.
He said there was a big male pig with a blood sponge in the pig's cage.
Forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig strangled the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", the Guiyang Evening News quoted a cousin named Wu as saying.
Security camera footage showed Yuang coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuana was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pigs were locked up to keep them from attacking anyone else while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the marketplace are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of human-to-human swine attacks have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man to suffer severe bodily injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer by the tractor, but then his wife removed the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "scatter".
We'd just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
All we need to do is show them a sufficient degree of respect, he added.
In the southwest of the United States, heavy rainfall is coming from the remnants of the Rosa hurricane.
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to move toward colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico and deteriorate.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has been a Category 1 hurricane since Sunday morning at 5:00 a.m. eastern time with winds of 137 km/h and is located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is strengthening a low-pressure area moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, with Rosa approaching the Bay California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, pushing high tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, mixed with a low-pressure area, will produce heavy rainfall over the wider southwest in the coming days.
Local 25 to 100 mm of rainfall will cause dangerous flooding, flood deposition and the possibility of land creeping in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity, rainfall in some places will be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over much of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Flooding is possible because of the rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be very unwise to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and storms will bring local sunshine, wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring local rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rainfall above 12 mm is possible, which may cause less flood delay and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region in the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical storms will begin to approach Arizona late Saturday afternoon and early Monday morning, and rainfall will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread across the sky on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
The United States may experience large temperature fluctuations in October as the Arctic cools and the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a prime example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central United States.
There's a 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis, Iowa, and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to settle and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern United States will enter a warm October with temperatures of around 27°C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, it could be 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good prospects for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the interview of Bret Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched an interesting Thursday testimony by Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued to falter as television stations cut off regular programming due to Friday's last-minute coup: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford's told the Justice Department she's 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was grabbing her in a guilty state and trying to strip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh testified in a tumultuous testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people were expected to watch the witness on Friday.
The company counted the average television viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that carried out the witnessing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble counting the number of viewers watching the show in the offices.
For the record, the audience is similar to the football finals or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose executives strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, leads the nation in broadcasting the all-day hearing, averaging 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million, reports Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a starring role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanough, CNN and CBS television cameras recorded Friday morning protesters shouting at him as he tried to enter the elevator to attend the Justice Committee hearings.
During the filming, he hung up a look for a few minutes, which was captured live on CNN cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you", a woman told him.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
You have power, while many women are powerless.
Flake said his office made a statement, and he added that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All the networks were still broadcasting live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted to put Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he'd only do it if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority party was calling for.
Flake was partly persuaded to do so by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the vote to nominate Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of playing political games in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing 'political games' with Britain's future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview besides her cover story, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson escalated his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay tariffs on each other was "absolutely absurd".
Shots fired on Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of killing an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to the Baron Rouge police report, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his sunglasses during the fight.
Police found sunglasses at the scene and Simpson's DNA on them, CBS is supplementing the WAFB reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, police issued a statement saying he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bail is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
A parish sheriff in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report Friday stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are grateful for the assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the Louisiana State Police's fugitive special unit, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and residents of the area.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for their care and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time", Wade said.
A volcano burns ash at Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater intensified, recording 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center has observed several instances of thunder and seismic seismic waves.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods such as Xocchimilco, the capital city of Ciudad de Mexico.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 shook central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-crime police units and thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized secession vote.
A group of masked separatist supporters held by the anti-terrorist police force were stabbed with eggs and stained with dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later, there were clashes, with police officers using cranes to stop the clashes.
Independence supporters who cried for hours without forgetting, without forgiveness, faced unity protesters and shouted 'Long live Spain!'
According to local media, 14 people were slightly injured during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions remain in the region that supports independence.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the continuation of voting in the region's elections.
Independence groups camped outside the polling station at night to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite the important, though close, regional elections in December, pro-independence Catalan parties have found it difficult to defend the initiative this year as many of the most prominent leaders are in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is escalating", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained before the trial began, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen in the Spanish governmenthe said.
Londonderry: arrested men who crashed into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for multiple car crashes into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 7.30pm British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, they're supposed to be shooting at the car with a single shotgun.
With a penalty kick, Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers.
Dolly Meng with her first goal for Livingston secured a win
Livingston impressed the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mango's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernian's team in second place.
Gerrard's team went undefeated in this year's championship, and next Sunday they're facing Hearts, who lead the table eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his division record to six games, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to taste a defeat.
Livingston wasted his chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have led the way long before the attack, as they caused a lot of trouble with their immediacy to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but he sent the ball through the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit through the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head through the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous to the guests during breaks in the attack.
And that's how they came up with the key to the goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengui, who shot and struck from the middle of the penitentiary.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but they couldn't beat home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made Kelly's defense stronger.
Rangers quarterback Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot with his leg, and Lithgow shot a shot past the goal from another Livingston interception in the attack.
Proposals continued to come to Livingston's penitentiary, but the inmates rejected all of the assaults, two felonies  Halkett's transfer offense to Glenn Middleton and a hand-play offense and the judge did not file.
Excellent performance  Livingston  analysis
The BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
That's a great performance and a great score for Livingston.
They've all been great and they're still exceeding expectations on their way up.
The style of play and the character have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited for the way he woke the team up from their arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played a very important role in deploying a well-organized defense while keeping Meng on standby all the time with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers just lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard's leadership, they lack these standards.
The only shots left on the goal were once they successfully beat the hosts' defense and this is a wake-up call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the standings.
Erdoğan was received in Cologne in a mixed reception.
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There were disputes over human rights, press freedom and Turkish accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate the massive new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters also expressed their views  many of them Kurds  who do not support Erdogan's government and condemned Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
Opponents of the protests reflect a split in the visitor, who some German Turks celebrate as a hero and others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: Motorcyclist killed in a car crash
In London, a cyclist died in a race involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, South East of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m. British Summer Time.
The driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred just months after the cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street about a mile from Saturday's crash.
Police have issued a statement saying that officers are verifying the identity of the man so they can notify relatives.
Roadblocks were put in place and bus lines diverted, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards wounded in the fence
Six prison guards were wounded in the sternum of a strictly guarded male prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9.30am British Summer Time and is still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado Unit have been called in to handle the raid, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A prison staff representative said: "We have called in specially trained staff to take care of the repair work at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will take the responsibility and they may be jailed for even longer.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June reported that the prison administrator was in hospital because of an attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, they called a police counter-terrorism unit into the prison to intervene in a violent raid in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (which may be beneficial for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is sweeping through the southwest of the desert, posing a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to make a furious move over Phoenix on Tuesday, but it's approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 300 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged for good 60 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of individual rainfall up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin, are expected to experience 25 to 50 mm of precipitation, with individual precipitation up to 100 mm possible.
For areas outside the threat of sudden flooding, the rain from Hurricane Rosa may be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, good 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, reports weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (137 km/h), is 620 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 20 miles per hour (19 km/h).
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and weakens.
The landfall in Mexico is expected to reach the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore presents a high risk of flooding.
From the Baja California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with a 250 mm drop, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, then traveling through Arizona and southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall on the Baja California Peninsula in northwestern Sonora and the American southwestern desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These precipitation can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and flooding in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 PM British Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police report.
Police are calling anyone who may have picked up the incident on their cell phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the displeasure and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthlessness and unheard-of tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered the unkindness and anger of the Democratic Party in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexually assaulting her a decade ago when they were teenagers.
She also testified against Ford's at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the finest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm really trying to run for office, he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere.
Trump claims the Democrats are on a mission to suppress and hinder.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place Friday at the latest, a Republican Party adviser told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of them carried away by huge waves that rocked the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palos on Friday when a 20-foot [6.0 m] wave hit the shore in the twilight, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude quake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they became victims", said a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a meeting in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it brought everything to the ground,  explained to Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Agency show destroyed buildings and shops, rolling and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The seismic sunsets continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, earthquakes of some kind were felt.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater off the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggala region, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely disrupted and there is no information from Donggala area.
More than 300,000 people live in the area,the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse", they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not informing the public that the tsunami hit Paul, but officials say the waves came just in time to issue the warning.
An amateur video posted on social media shows a man shouting from the top floor warning people on the street of the looming tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall hit the shore and took buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palois, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport was opened only for the purpose of providing aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr Dosebe, World Vision members from Donggala arrived safely in Pal, where employees in the courtyard set up a shelter from the looting outside their premises, but saw numerous scenes of devastation along the way.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to come to Pal.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, cross-border financing, stocks and staff assistance are only permitted if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still treated as a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can accept international aid, but that's not the status yet.
The night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palo Alto, friends and relatives of the missing are holding out hope that their nearby miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national rowing team, trained two missing rowing parachutes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others caught at the Ro Ro Hotel were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
"As a sailing mayor, I carry my emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how, during the hour when news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse circulated throughout the rowing community, he desperately sent messages on the WhatsApp app to competitors in Palu who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered", he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while loading an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee.
According to police reports from Newport, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's security worker who filled an ATM in downtown Newport on the Leeve on Friday morning.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was employed, another man approached a Brink's security guard employee from behind and stole a bag of delivery money.
Witnesses reportedly saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not say the exact number of people involved.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects should call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "Being officially Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is set to present his new album Yandhi.
He will be replaced by singer Ariano Grande, who has cancelled the show for personal reasons, the show's creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has also said that the word has religious significance for him.
I think ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning you (see ti), West said earlier this year when discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
So that I am you and I am all of you.
Kanye, which means "one", I've changed to Ye, which reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of all that we are.
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without it and in upper case.
Mexican President AMLO has promised not to use military force against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody student violence.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
At the time of the beginning of the left-wing student movement in Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in the marketplace, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide monthly grants to students and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal organizations.
The US should double its funding for AI.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research spending on this field, says AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have predicted the use of artificial intelligence, even though the US does not have an official AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the best in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are quite close to the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI breakthrough will happen in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest-rated American game player, Othello, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee said he was familiar with past U.S. government technology competitions, such as the robotics competition organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when he would be next to find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best academics, it's companies", Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best of the best from universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think people with an AI PhD should automatically be offered a green card", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China funds people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence that brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a closer AI committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Security Intelligence Commission has been doing nothing for months.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece over their application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The government reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 percent as long as it is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by agreeing to a deal with Greece?
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price to pay for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijeva, from Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
'I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,' said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital city of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, presented their ballots for a referendum in Macedonia on the name change of the country that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was setting up a small stage and setting up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", said the Kavadarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
I believe that a large majority will support, as more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,Zaev said after handing out his ballot.
He added that it would be a positive outcome to confirm our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
A second poll by Macedonian television channel Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent would vote for them.
In order for the referendum to succeed, voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government that took office in May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City played the entire Brighton defence and scored
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguer's shot in the 65th minute seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward took the field in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three of Brighton's defensive players and found a spot open.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He beat one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he gave Sterling his left.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with his first touch in the penalty box, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with leg problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But Sterling was the one who secured the blue boys an opening lead in the first ever English League match.
He scored the goal in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton's half.
He gave Leroy Sane a nice left-handed ball.
Sanne touched the ball a couple of times, then sent the ball to Sterling at the remote gate.
The Blue Son attacker threw the ball into the net just before it slipped past the naked eye.
City will meet Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies and ruin their title chances.
The Nationals are out of the end zone, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But Scherzer, who's always competitive, hopes to make it to the pitchers' heels on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, which will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the Finals, as they have a Western League lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured the least invitation from the organization on Friday with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they're still waiting for their first division title.
While we can't win anything, we'll at least be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a huge crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at the most likely level this year.
So why wouldn't you want to compete?
The Nationals haven't released the names of the first pitcher for Sunday yet, but it's likely to be Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first to throw in 34 games, will be a free agent on Thursday and would have had enough days off by Sunday.
The Washington, D.C. right-hander has 18 wins and seven losses this season, with a .253 batting average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voting in midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
This will be one of the biggest, he said. "I'm really trying to run, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere".
Trump went on to say, "We have this horrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and it's happening right now.
They are determined to take back power, using every means possible.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should trample to get power and control. They want power and control, but we don't give it to them.
He said the Democrats are on a mission to stop and stop.
"And you've seen that in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean, mean and lying.
The name was given by Justice Committee member, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, to a loud disapproval from the audience.
Remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait, that was really bad body talk, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
She's impatient with people who express their opinions.
When a Momentum activist told me about a distrust at my local client, it wasn't even a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who are not wanted for expressing their views.
My colleague, Congresswoman Joan Ryan, had a similar experience because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a motion of no confidence about my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
In the notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, it said that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
In the eight years I've been a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday meetings have been mostly exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of most meetings today, and the promise of a more friendly and gentle policy has long been forgotten, if ever started.
It is increasingly clear that differences in opinion within the Labour Party are not permissible and that it is assessed in each opinion whether this is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who I previously thought shared similar political views expected me to change my mind and take positions I would never agree with  whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly  and it doesn't really matter what I say  there are criticisms on social media that call for openness, condemn environmental policy and tell me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made to me are purely political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this political period is how abuse rates have become quite commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to differences of opinion and with every proposal of mistrust or change in the rules for selecting a client, it becomes more visible.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down and not be so loud, and I'll be fine.
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which literally ruined the classroom in my primary school. As a local councillor or government minister, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most.
I never hid my political beliefs, including in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I don't understand their desire to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is sailing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents and constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of election or political expediency will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr at the top of the standings
Two well-known attempts slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderful fun championship match of the day.
Now they're at the top of the standings and the only undefeated team in 10 years.
In the end, the home-field advantage was their top defense and better use of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be happy.
'We have passed many tests in our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy,' he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Congratulations to the Ayra team, they took advantage of the opportunity better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute shot, converted by Frazier Climo, took Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in a game against the Warriors, meant a number of overtures for Melrose and Jason Baggott overturned the attempt without conversion.
Climo improved Ayr's lead on the break before hitting just halfway through and then converted the independent effort to a 17-5 lead for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose got off to a great start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which turned him into Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
A long break followed due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was carried on the carrier, and Ayr continued to progress with Stafford McDowall's experiment, which turned him into a Clima.
Interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon was then given a yellow card and Melrose re-used the player game more with the unconventional attempt of Bruce Colvin at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for obstructing the Clim without the ball, MacPherson hit a home run.
The climax came after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong's shot and sent out winger Greg Henry for the fifth host test.
The Still Game star is launching a new career in the hospitality industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran is apparently joining the guest list, at least to become the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star of the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the screenplay, plays Jack Jarvis alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that after the upcoming ninth season, it's over, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning a life after Craig Lang.
According to the official documents, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the thriving Glasgow hospitality.
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are Navy blue flags hanging in public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea".
It is our duty to recover it.
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of losing the coastline in a bloody natural resource dispute with Chile in the 19th century is still alive  as is the longing for a renewed tide across the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1, after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia is driven, united and impartial and, of course, looks forward to a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia, which claims that after decades of unstable talks, Chile must negotiate Bolivia's access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations about Monday's ruling.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia  and even if it did, not much would change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's decision comes only six months after the final arguments were heard means that the case was complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not been in favor of Bolivia, but they may be costing a lot.
"The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea", said Zarateva.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has drained all the goodwill that may have remained from Chileans, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court made an unusually quick decision.
He said Monday would bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139-year-old disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  was still one of the most popular Latin American presidents  using the maritime issue as a political support.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The decision is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past.
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his people will never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The United States has called on the United Nations to deliver on its promises made at a meeting of the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the brink of resuming nuclear diplomacy, which has been at a dead end, more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong to think that continuing sanctions and opposing the announcement of the end of the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious in confirming the prediction without Pyongyang first taking decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about disarming, which the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion magazines have unveiled the latest line of giant covers coming to affordable brand stores near you.
If you want to complete your cover collection or completely hide from the sun, you don't have to look further.
In their 2019 Spring and Summer Fashion Track collections, designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a collection of bizarre oversized covers that blinded the style at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has flooded with very impractical coverage, and designers have sent their spectacular creations to the fashion house.
Valentine's most notable piece was a beige hat with wide shorts decorated with feather-like accessories in which models' heads were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included precious stone shells, a magic hat and even pineapple, but your heads won't get hot.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks... the perfect time for Halloween.
The many-colored masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One design was similar to a breathing apparatus and glasses, while the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow the fashions, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that giant cover will arrive at stores near you.
The wide hats closely follow La Bombi, a straw hat with a 60-centimeter shortness was seen on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
A cult brand for an extremely impractical hat that has flooded social media has sent another large creation  a beach straw bag that was almost as big as the model in the bathing suit she wore.
The raffle bag in burnt orange colour, with raffle scissors and a white leather handkerchief, was the centrepiece of designer Jacquemus's La Riviera collection for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the big beach hats and bags to hit stores next summer because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for too many accessories would be hard to ignore".
John Edward: Language knowledge is key to global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with a further series of outstanding results on examinations, further reinforced by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, the conversation is memorized.
But when you speak to a person in his mother tongue, the words are in his heart.
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the independent school performance rankings.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language got excellent grades.
Data collected from 74 schools in the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 per cent of pupils achieved excellent grades in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of pupils in German, 69 per cent of pupils in French and 63 per cent of pupils in Spanish also achieved excellent grades.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as elective subjects in independent school curricula and elsewhere, as are subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers struggle to fill vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future career path.
For future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in a global world.
If a person learns a second language, whatever career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically has an advantage over the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate, with French being the only language spoken by a two-thirds of respondents, or 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today's children.
By learning more languages, especially those from developing countries, children have better opportunities to find suitable employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a choice of languages taught by experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, there is no denying that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country and that this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I need to be fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut in San Diego on Sunday in a Lakers jersey.
For fans looking forward to LeBron James' first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48", Walton explained on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers official Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six preseason games for the Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia today.
This is the first of Trump's five planned meetings next week, including stops in his favored states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his Supreme Court nominee has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face a loss of control of Congress following the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia, and where can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. eastern time.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live online on his YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to talk about the Supreme Court's Brett Kavanaugh hearing this week, which has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, which has delayed Senate confirmation by one week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain new momentum as important elections are set to take place in November.
That's why President Trump's campaign has called for these five meetings to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and House", Reuters reports.
"Congressional oversight is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the hectic campaign season", a Trump campaign official who declined to be named told Reuters.
According to West Virginia MetroNews, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend today's event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, which would draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, where he scored more than 40 percent of his points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in public opinion polls.
"For Morrisey, it's a bad sign that the president should come and welcome him into the public opinion polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA still has a desire to win and hope for Sunday's individual match
After three one-way games, Saturday afternoon foursome matches may have been what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The no-nonsense swing is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where's the swing hanging now?
"They had a six-point lead, but now they have four, so it's probably a new start for us", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course, as it leads by four points and can win another 12.
But Americans, Spieth said, feel like they're getting wind in their sails, and they're also encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, each scoring three out of four points.
Spieth was doomed from the first punch to the green and sets a good example.
The screams of good fortune continued to grow louder, leading to a decisive blow when Thomas and the team were tied by two points in the fourth game.
The blow that brought them victory on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that would let you know that he believes the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to fame.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The unusual but charming pair from Europe won four points out of four and they are infallible.
The two Molliwoods were the only two to avoid the storm on Saturday afternoon, and the storm also avoided the storm on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the apparent flow of energy between them and the loud crowd confirm the fact that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and no other player could seal Europe's eventual victories better than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
If possible, both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European glory would be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, who was paired with Alex Noren.
The bull and the two double bulls in the first nine holes have plunged Spain and Sweden into a crisis from which they have not found a way out.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Four-ball games and two-pairs matches are the exception to the interesting thing about watching closely because of the communication between the couples, the tips they give, the tips they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage before the final day, but the two-two matches showed that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a nice lead after Saturday's four-ball and two-pair games lead 10-6 against the United States.
A remarkable pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari gave their best and scored four points with two victories over Tiger Woods and at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorne, who are trying to win the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltin, had a 3-1 lead over the American team that was defeated in the morning games with four balls.
The U.S. team had a better two-two performance, winning two games, but they couldn't make up for the loss.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games if they're going to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while Molinari (the pair were nicknamed Molliwood) became only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then showed up again, beating outgoing Woods and American journalist Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for a moment, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball and two-two games, seven of them consecutively.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning four-ball game, returned for a two-two match and, paired with Henry Stenson, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, ranked first and third respectively, 2-1.
But on a nice, windy day in the southwest of Paris, everything did not go according to the plans of the European team.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They decisively defeated the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter by 2-1, with four balls, and later came back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in a doubleheader, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team come back four points behind in a single-elimination match, although Furyk's team needs only a draw to retain the trophy.
But after two days in another place, the Sunday counterattack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: Without trust, we will not unilaterally disarm 
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were creating increasing distrust of the United States and that under such conditions North Korea would certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho told the World Trade Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken a number of important goodwill measures last year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing nuclear test sites and promising not to expand nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see an adequate response from the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in national security and under these conditions we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm.
While Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a progressive nuclear disarmament approach in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking progressive measures, his statement was significant because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to accept the call to release the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists that we must first disarm, and is increasing sanctions pressure to achieve its objectives by force, and even opposes the declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don't even know us.
The problem is that the continued implementation of sanctions only increases our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president unveiled at the UN General Assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that took place in the past five months, adding: "If the nuclear disarmament issue had been discussed with South Korea rather than the United States, the Korean Peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have ended at such a dead end".
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was in a completely different tone from last year's when he told the United Nations General Assembly that a US missile attack on the North Korean mainland was inevitable after the evil President Trump branded Kim as a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea completely, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations General Assembly, but said he still had a long way to go and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set time frame for this, saying: "It could take two years, three years, or five months. It doesn't matter".
China and Russia are of the opinion that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for its actions.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue decisively without exception until we recognize the complete, definitive and verified state of nuclear disarmament".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions against North Korea to prevent funding for North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Riy on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, and North Korea had been criticizing him for hours, saying his demands were "gangsters".
North Korea pledged at the Moon meeting this month to demolish the missile test station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States takes appropriate measures.
Kim is supposed to tell Moon that the "concentration measures" are meant to provide security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a class that teaches them how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year's new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep, and to fight against a growing machist culture of cello-long learning where caffeine is the source of strength.
A university professor found that students at the world's best universities often lack the basic knowledge of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, the first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to take such a course after his talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
When he was finished, a girl came up to him and said, "How do I know this until now, when I'm a senior?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, discusses the key importance of good sleep habits for academic and sporting success as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer, says that the decision to take this course came when students experienced a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section shows a picture of the door of the student home where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports cups and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on sports success, and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second section, participants learn that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A student village map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that students' behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how smoking cigarettes affects their health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride in "living full-time" learning is still present, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, which results in sleep deprivation, are a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that adequate quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" for fighting stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and that this can also help them avoid gaining weight.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and last year, as a freshman at Harvard, he attended one of his professors' lectures.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct the course throughout the school district.
He hopes that at the next stage, he will be able to ask graduate students to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock to sleep and wake up, and also warns them of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LEDs, which can cause an imbalance in circadian rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston: Rangers = 1: 0 Men with a hit drowned the hopes of Gerrard 's team
The Rangers again defeated in the guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston condemned the announced team of Steven Gerrard to a defeat by 1:0.
The Ibrox team were chasing their first host win since their February 4:1 victory at St Johnstone Stadium, but Gary Holt's side gave them their second defeat in 18 games since Gerrard led the team, leaving his side 8 points behind the top team in the Scottish League.
The men attacked seven minutes into the first half, and the Rangers' chosen lineup didn't seem to want to tie.
With this, the Rangers fell to the regular place, and Livingston advanced to third place, but by the score difference, the Hibernian team was behind.
Calum Spence, the referee, suffered a head injury when he was reportedly hit by a flying object from the host team's fan base.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team that easily beat Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was holding on to the verified 11-year-old Livingston, who had taken a point from the Hearts team a week earlier, and was undoubtedly thrilled with how his runaway team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher ownership of the ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the start when Meng found Scott Pittman with his first short pass, who then went on to score Allen McGregor, but the driver was uncertain in the performance and missed the opportunity.
The long free kick from Keagan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but the ball was then passed to his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow who failed to score.
The Rangers took over in the final third, but the game was more about hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after a fight with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the game, a penalty shoot-out should have been awarded, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to score just two shots in the first half, but neither the head shot that Lassana Coulibaly sent to the goal nor the slugging ball of Ovie Eary posed any danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston's 34th-minute opening goal may have surprised everyone, but he was already well deserved for his persistence.
The Rangers failed to cash in another Jacobs set with a long list.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball into Scott Robinson's hands, who routinely prepared a pass for Mengi to easily complete the attack.
Gerrard took action and replaced Coulibaly with a wingman Ryan Kent during the break, who immediately proved himself with a pass to Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his lines and blocked the attack.
Still, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett making sure more runs were scored.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was unstable after the corner draw.
With the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a penalty shot at the end of the game after contacting Jacobs, but Judge Thomson refused to admit it.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
We present a page from our Sunday edition of the Almanac: On September 30, 1882, more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, who later became a world-renowned physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
It became a fixture in the scientific world, but it also gained a place in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play a cowboy scientist:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: This is Geiger's counter, used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear exactly the effect of radioactivity on the atoms in the materials.
"But now they're really calling!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize the invading cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and destroy the invading cells
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to recognize the invading cells
This method involves the extraction of the patient's immune cells, which are then modified in the laboratory.
They can then identify the protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer and then return it to the patient.
The results of the trial vaccine are very encouraging in patients with a very wide range of cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the invading cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the acquisition of the patient's immune cells, which are modified in the laboratory to detect the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to acquiring immune cells from patients who are taught to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West performed a protracted performance on SNL with the tag MAGA on the butt.
The audience was not thrilled.
Kanye West was spat out in the studio of Saturday Night Live after a bizarre moment in which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After the performance ended with the third song of his performance, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the inscription Make America Great Again, West began to attack the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often get to talk to a white person and he says, 'How can you like Trump when he's a racist?'
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago", he says.
This time, SNL began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood actor was dipping into the testimony of Bret Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The footage of West's monologue was not played, but it was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was gonna make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had some trouble with his back because of the punctuation.
They're coming after me.
They told me to go on stage with this hat.
I was being harassed!
And they say I'm lost, he said after the Washington Examiner report.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the lost scene?" and he added, "I need to put on Superman's helmet because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments have prepared the audience for whistling at least twice and the members of the SNL team were in obvious disarray, but someone told Vanity: "There was a deadly silence in the studio".
Westa was invited at the last minute to go on a goat exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused a lot of surprise with the music video for the song I Love it, where he wore a Perrier mineral water bottle costume.
Westa was backed by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls:
And talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply what he is, and that's okay.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, welcomes and propagates an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so did we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would be formally known as Kanye West.
He's not the first musician to change his name, but he's been doing it before Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His roommate, Snoop Dogg, was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became the Artist, once known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing a person at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been acting out against toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his swordsmanship role as Jon Snow in HBO's thrilling medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old actor who has strongly condemned the stereotype of a macho hero says that when young men play such roles on screen, they often feel that they can only earn respect by being tough.
Keith told The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something was wrong, and wondered how he could cope with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #JazTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a fellow actor in Game of Thrones, admits that he has strong beliefs about the subject.
"I personally am seriously wondering right now where we went wrong when it comes to manhood", he said.
What have we taught men as we grow up about the problems we face now?
The whale believes that television is partly responsible for increasing male toxicity due to the portrayal of highly capable characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
What do we learn on television and in the streets that young boys feel they have to choose that particular side of masculinity?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is how can we change that?
Because obviously something was wrong with the young men.
In an interview, he also said that after the series ended next summer, he would not be involved in filming any previews or sequels of Game of Thrones because he ended with battles and horses.
The whale will star in the November premiere of Sam Shepard's new production of True West, a story about a film producer and his brother a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that ever happened to him about Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on set.
"It was through this series that I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on out", he said.
Rose starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the love interest of Keith's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been affected.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet established a specific methodology for the assessment of the new cases.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which is a change from the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Junan Province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China continues to increase by 100,000 people annually.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a very serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very much present.
Because conservative values still prevail in the country, 70~90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman, according to survey results.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection from sexual intercourse in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of efforts to address the problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff has released information on Republican senators, condemns dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that a member of her staff posted information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations came from individuals and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more unacceptable lies", Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The information disclosed under this submission includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
This information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment of Supreme Court Justice candidate Bret Kanaugh.
The leak came after three senators completed the Kavanaugh hearing.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that the IP address allows the source of a publication that is alleged to be linked to Senator Waters' office to be identified and to conclude that the information was published by someone on staff, Hill reports.
These unfounded accusations are completely false and a pure lie, Waters continues.
My employees whose identity, personal data and security are compromised by these false accusations are not responsible for the leakage of this data.
These unfounded accusations are completely untrue and a pure lie.
Senator Waters' statement quickly met with criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial of anger has made me angry", wrote Fleischer.
That could mean he's not in the right congressional test.
When you accuse someone of something they didn't do, they shouldn't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he can't doubt the motive of the accuser.
He needs to stay calm.
Fleischer compared Waters' response to a Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too obviously angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for the city of Waters in the midterm elections, tweeted.
If it's true, it's true, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her cabinet had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, and that they are held accountable for any acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them".
Johnny English back in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
Looking for clues to Brexit in any new British film has become a tradition, and it is also considered a revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003 with the title Johnny English and a sequel in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Will a funny satire about how screw-up we are be a new export opportunity for us?
With his blurred eyes and unusual face, incompetent Johnny English is given permission to re-mix the strips; his name suggests that he is a comic character created for a cinematic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It's a barren secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a piece of Clouseau, a punch from Mr. Bean and the smallness of the one who contributed the final note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It's also based on the traveler and international mystery Atkinson once played in an already forgotten TV commercial for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real mess.
The latest film, though, does present one or two pleasant moments.
I loved it when Johnny English approached in a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor blade briefly touched his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly demonstrated, but humor seems a bit mild and overly unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission Impossible now offer comedic elements without bad conscience.
It seems that humor is aimed at children and not so much at adult audiences, which is why for me, Johnnie Englisch's rejection of opportunities is not as innovative and directed as Atkinson's mute sketch as Mr. Bean.
The constant theme is now clear that Britain is in serious trouble.
A web hacker has infiltrated the web of Britain's most top-secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble for the authoritative agent, played by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is a breaking point for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a breakdown due to political dislike: Emma Thompson has struggled to play the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible about the script that she can help herself with.
The intelligence agency will inform her that all active spies have been exposed and she must choose one of the retired spies.
And this is Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school, who informally teaches how to work undercover: here the writers hit it off, because English is running some kind of spy academy called "Rock Academy".
Englisch is being taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting where he meets longtime collaborator Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the submarine commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
Batman and Robin are thus prepared to create more trouble in the name of Her Majesty's secret service, while meeting the fateful Ophelio Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as a waitress set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak aboard a Volt yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality to get to know the inside of the Volt house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite its sympathy and energy, it is reminiscent of a children's film.
Very average.
Like other John English films, I can't help but wonder if the British film can actually give Atkins a role that really justifies his talent.
Labour denies that they plan a four-day workweek for Britons, receiving a five-day workweek payment.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a radical plan where British people work four days a week and get paid for five days.
The party wants business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the AI revolution to workers and give them extra free time.
That way, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend with equal pay.
The insiders say the idea fits the client's economic plan and the plan to put the state on the side of the workers.
Trade unions support the shift to a four-day work week as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'The political outline is due to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-week workweek is an objective that we will strive to achieve by using a customer approach to economic balance in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the customer.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported the four-week campaign in its 2017 general election.
This objective is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not party policy and the party is not thinking about it.
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to tear the power of non-executive directors and shareholders in municipal enterprises.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the plumbing companies may not regain full stake as a Labour party could file a lawsuit on alleged wrongdoing.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in administrative boards and to set up ownership funds, transferring 10% of the stake in private companies to employees, thus receiving annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, on the 60 Minutes show, discussed whether their opinion could be changed by the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Justice Bret Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and raises the question of whether the office's findings of any Republican senator could persuade the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, a correspondent on the 60-minute program asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to that than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him, when this charge came up, I asked him, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unwavering, unshakable.
Graham's voice seems to be carved into stone.
'I have created my own opinion of Bret Kavanaugh and would need a very compelling reason to change it,' he said.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she named could confirm that.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed in any way to poverty alleviation?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event that features a truly extraordinary array of stars with an equally extraordinary mission: to end the world's poverty.
The festival, which will be held for the seventh time, will draw tens of thousands of people to the Grand Triangle of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest in the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free event ticket (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a variety of tasks or activities, such as volunteering, a letter to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of poverty alleviation.
But how successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years to go to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them that they need to act, or is this just another example of the so-called "clicktivism" of creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or tweeting?
The Global Citizen movement states that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters in pursuit of a range of goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders adopt commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific target for the group to be considered as a beneficiary of the measures.
The group estimates that the funds raised have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to helping the poor realize their full potential, which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help tackle malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens movement.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can erase the social blame of malnutrition from the historical archives", Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for the Partnership for Food Power, told a crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions called on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced that it would co-finance the Power of Food project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional measures.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's response was: "It's going to be a long, hard road, sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers who will perform at this year's New York event include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe, and the event will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block Russian energy exports.
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke reportedly said that Washington could use the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy trafficking, including in the Middle East.
Zinka said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of legitimate governments) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe, I should say.
The official said there were ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can do this, the Navy makes sure our sea lanes are open and blocks them if necessary, thus preventing Russian energy from entering the market", he said.
Zinka addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Association, a nonprofit group known as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was actually the same.
As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less to influence fuel and its substitution, he said, calling Russia a "trick-taking country" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came at a time when the Trump administration is seeking to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, where it is expected to undermine Russia, which is a significantly cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is supposed to make Berlin the "flyer" of Moscow after Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth USD 11 billion and expected to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington is strongly opposed to the project for economic reasons only and that it is unfair competition.
"I think we share the same view that energy should not be a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany has rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The involvement of a third country in our energy supply is a major challenge for me said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be carefully considering her candidacy for the 2020 US presidential election, says a Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would be considering her candidacy for President of the United States after the midterm elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she'd consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader", The Hill reported.
I will be closely considering my candidacy for President after 6 November.
Warren's been a hit at a meeting at City Hall with President Donald Trump, because he was supposed to be leading this country in the wrong direction.
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is very worrying to me", she said.
Warren has been outspoken about Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy on several occasions.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the election".
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of her own constituents believe Warren should not run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, a senator should not run for president, with 85% of the likely Massachusetts voters.
Two-thirds of the vote would be in favor of her candidacy.
The poll showed she had the most support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents reportedly supporting her and 48 percent opposing her.
Other top Democrats who would be considered for the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin has spoken out at a supporting Donald Trump rally about post-traumatic stress disorder.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, connects me to other families who are coping with post-traumatic stress disorder and the degree of injury that our soldiers are coming back with", he told an audience at a supporting Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palinova called her son's arrest a "saloon in the living room", saying her son and other war veterans were returning slightly altered, hardened, wondering where the respect for what the soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military had given to the country was.
Track Palina was arrested Monday in the Wasilla, Alaska, area and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal enforcement of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the district filled courthouses on Friday to support the legal restraint of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal politics has not been released.
She said that her partner and her violent sons, gang members, abused her, but on July 20, the U.S. authorities denied her asylum application.
She was arrested in Texas.
Federal prosecutors supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have received numerous asylum applications to the United States, as countries that are constantly confronted with gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the Immigration Appeals Board's decision in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney for the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "deprecates decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle, the court's application states.
The prosecutors further stated in the request that policies that deny immigrants the right to enter harm the American economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to provide the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in a policy release on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palo Alto has doubled, but desperate rescue efforts are underway to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The feeling is very tense", said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her hot boyfriend at an evacuation center in the secluded city of Palo.
Rescue crews are continuously hauling bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
It looked like it was populated, returning to their destroyed homes, struggling through the stuff and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude quake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, were resting outside the Palou military hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors for persistent strong aftershocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think it's pushed me against the walls, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he was in town with his family for the wedding.
I heard a woman crying for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of misconduct with propaganda ads
A week after a four-page ad in an official Chinese newspaper in the U.S. newspaper praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China, Beijing, accused the U.S. press of misusing it to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Sunday mentioned a paid addition to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after China accused it of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Reuters reported that US federal officials described Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to meddle in the US federal election as a new phase in Washington's increasingly intense push to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish trade promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an increasingly intense trade war, exchanging strikes by imposing tariffs on imported products.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were expected to hurt exporters in states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the top exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, now this harassment is doubled by the publication of propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has used the valued American tradition of free speech and free press to publish paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see little other opinion on the pages of Beijing newspapers and no real reflection of the diversity of views Chinese citizens have about the worrying Chinese economic path, as the clothes are strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most important newspapers rejected an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans are losing their ballots before midterm elections by defeating Kavanaugh, analysts warn.
Analysts warn that the support of many of the top Republicans who support and defend Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh despite multiple sexual assault allegations will be felt in the upcoming midterm elections, losing the vote.
The sentiment here is extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This is irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, told an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flack's last-minute pressure to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national representative for the progressive movement group MoveOn, according to a report by the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is Coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic news portal reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will transcend all borders", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told reporters.
People say they're strong now, and it's true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among unincorporated suburban voters and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president but don't vote often.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts said that continued Republican support could have negative consequences.
"This has become a big mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just the vote of the world or the final vote or the Kavanaugh oath; it's also the way Republicans deal with it and how they treat Ford", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an election-supporting group for Democrats, told the television channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided between believing Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's testimony, with a slightly more supportive view of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony most or least, and 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh most or least.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying during his testimony, compared with only 30 percent who said so about Ford.
Under pressure from Flack, the FBA is currently investigating charges brought by Ford, and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17 in a guilty state.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her sexuality while they were at a party together while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web is planning to launch a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is opening a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners' Open Source Solid platform.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's purpose was to rule the world.
"We decided to do it now", he said of the new company.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows users to create a personal data storage storage or POD
This may include contact information, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The special feature of a personal data warehouse is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
The company calls this "personal data authorisation".
Chief Executive Officer John Bruce says the company's idea is to pool resources, processes and relevant skills that will enable everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
As early as this week, technology developers around the world could use the tools available on Inrupt's website to create their own decentralized applications.
Berners-Lee said he and the group  with Facebook and Google are not discussing whether they could implement a complete change that could overnight eliminate all their business models.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after the company is established.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The feast of the World War I Victorian Cross Bearer
For 100 years, the home town has been celebrating the award of the Victoria Cross to the only English clergyman to have won it as a World War I soldier.
The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned his credit on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was shot by a sniper, so he never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the Colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of the Archbishops, Michael Vann, said that it was extremely symbolic that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's act of awarding it.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Channel in very dense fog and under the intense fire of a battlefield and machine guns.
Later, he blew towards the line of fire and led the line forward with the greatest heroism, then struck the machine gun himself and struck three members of his squadron.
On October 4, 2018, Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that my old father's actions were something I knew and could never accomplish, so he taught me humility.
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, they also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of this parade, and that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him.
Fans of mixed martial arts spent the night watching Bellator 206 instead of the Pujs Pepe.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a sold-out Bellator 206 and then you can't see the main event.
The San Jose event spanned 13 fights, including six on the main stage, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to perform, viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked to discover that the broadcast had been replaced by a performance of a cartoon of Pussy Peep.
A lot of people weren't exactly excited because they stayed up until the morning just because of the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change to a children's cartoon as some kind of sick joke.
In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not suitable at 6am and therefore they had to switch to a children's programme, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Vice President of Marketing and Communications, when asked about the transmission.
♪ The peeps of Pep ♪
The Bellator President, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about re-enacting, I think we could arrange it", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we can't make it until Sunday, or Monday, or Sunday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there were a lot of messages exchanged during the shutdown, and not all of them were kind.
We tried to fix it; we assumed it was just a technical error.
But the real reason was a government ordinance.
I can promise you, this won't happen again.
Instead of six, we're gonna take five fights as usual, and we're gonna try to give fans more than they're expecting, and we're gonna do it.
This is a very ungrateful situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that his sexual orientation made him feel inferior to anyone  but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he realized that everyone is who they are when he entered high school.
In an interview on the first episode of Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others confidence.
He also said that as a parent, his desire to win the Olympics diminished.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, was away for several months due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as an alien in the first episode of Laverne, said he felt less worthy than everyone else because it was socially acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said: 'To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference are the real thing that gives me the strength and persistence to succeed.'
He wanted to prove that something was wrong, he said he wouldn't let anyone who finally found out about his orientation down.
The two-time bronze Olympian has become an influential LGBT rights advocate and has appeared twice at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on states to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he could talk openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others confidence.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised by his romance with male American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he says the age difference never meant problems.
"When you're so young, you're so young. "He went to his first Olympics at age 14, and three years later his father died. "He said it's hard to find someone his age who would have experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted a child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says that changed his overall outlook.
If you asked me last year, all I would have to say was I had to win the gold medal, he said.
But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son shares the same name as Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 of brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to have to die, and one of the last things he asked was if he already had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, 'You won't be in first class this time, Dad,' he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally had to admit that he wasn't untouchable", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I dreamed of my whole life, to dive in the Olympics in front of a home crowd.
It also inspired his first choice of songs, "Proud" by Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes his skin tingle.

Mickelson, unprepared, has won the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will be participating in the biennial event for a record 12 times, was seated by Captain Furyk on Saturday Thursday.
Instead of being at the center of events, as has so often been the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly improving his game to fix what weighs on him.
Given that he didn't measure the most straightforwardly at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old doesn't fit in well with Le Golf National's tight field, where long ice inevitably punishes missed hits.
And if the pitch wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will be facing the eventual British Open champion Francesc Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has joined up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood in the four-game win streak this week.
If the Americans, who have four fewer games in the first 12 games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
"He fully understands the role he played today, he grabbed me on the back and hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
She has a lot of confidence in herself.
He's one of the most famous and he's made a huge contribution to the team in the past and this week.
I probably never imagined he'd play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, and we thought that's the way it should be done.
He wants to play like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder Cup career, which never really matched the height of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence on the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spirited, likes to make a fool of himself and it's great to have him in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players were having fun when they played him this week, which was fun to watch.
It gives a lot more than just a game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major advantage may soon be knocked out
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily lead to an uncomfortable ride.
Young Danec made his debut in 1997 at the Valderra Games, where the side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but broke through the goal with a hair-only lead, with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Remember, we had a big advantage at Valderra; we had a big advantage at Brooklyn where we lost, and at Valderra where we won, but hardly", Bjorn said (pictured) after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and lead Le Golf National to a 10-6 lead.
So history tells me and everyone on the team that the Cup is not over.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to.
The game's not over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we need to stay focused on that.
He's always telling me to focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know who's on the other side.
Enthusiastic about his players' performance on a challenging field, Bjorn added: "I would never have been over here.
Tomorrow's going to be a different day.
Tomorrow, the game of the individual will be the main focus, so we're gonna have to take a different approach.
It's nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, your golfing skills are tested to the end.
That's the message you have to convey to the players: You have to bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your partner behind and he must make the best of himself.
Unlike Björn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they did as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the fence on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players to the final day of the game.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we'd like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When this drive gets steady, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We created the right layout and put the guys in a way that we felt like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the battle and battling Rory McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the second Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose this order for this group of boys because I think it covers the whole schedule", Bjorn said of the selection of individuals.
New German warship again postponed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War, but due to system failure and rapidly increasing costs, it will not be until at least next year, local authorities reported.
The delivery of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a military official.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has raised concerns after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, ordered in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and some concealment technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals  the latest frigates are expected to remain outside the home port for up to two years.
But the continued delays mean that the advanced warships that would enable Germany to influence its forces overseas will become obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the yard after it had been delivered.
The reasons for the return are little known, but the German authorities have identified a number of key programming and technical deficiencies that would render the warship useless if assigned to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors  only half the workforce on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also proved that the ship was heavily overweight, which reduced its capacity and limited the Navy's ability to upgrade it further.
The 7000-tonne ship Rheinland-Pfalz was said to be twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project  including crew training became a problem.
This is expected to reach a dizziness of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3,6 billion)  from the initial EUR 2,2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "lacking ships suitable for deployment".
The official said that the issue had become more acute over time as the old ships had been dismantled and no replacement ships had been provided.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret lives of bats
A new study is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands to discover how bats use their food to hunt for food.
They hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats and brown-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special cameras will be installed at key locations on the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using handheld detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all the footage will confirm the frequency of the bats' calls and what kind of activity they're doing.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour across the region.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are best suited for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined sharply over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting shelters and habitat loss.
The risks include wind turbines and lighting, as well as mosquito nets and certain types of chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
The bat is not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they use their ears more to help them catch prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated eholocation techniques to accurately identify errors and obstacles in flight paths.
NTS, which supplies more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land nationwide, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, asylum inspections and occasional rescue.
The organisation has even set up the first and so far only bat-specific reserve in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a great bat area on Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and a quality habitat.
But much is still known about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the premises, as the possible accidental destruction of a single bat hatchery could result in the death of up to 400 females and young, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Because bats are protected, they are not allowed to be killed, harassed or disturbed, nor are they allowed to destroy their birthplaces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we just don't know how well their populations are holding up".
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, and lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape that he allegedly committed fake news and said people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that she was then to be paid $375,000 for keeping quiet about the incident.
In an Instagram Live video of 142 million followers hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, called the report "false news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said was fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, which is part of the job I do.
I'm a happy man and I wish everyone well, "a smiling actor added.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have dubbed "unacceptable reporting on suspicions about private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will be seeking compensation for the non-violent damage in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the breach, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In a filing with the Clark County Circuit Court in Nevada, she was said to have returned to the player's room after meeting Ronald Major at the nightclub, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was a good man of 99 percent who only disappointed 1 percent.
Documents claim Ronaldo confirmed the sexual relationship, but he described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and that the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to a settlement in the evening because she feared vengeance and was concerned about public humiliation.
The 34-year-old claims she wants to cancel the settlement because she continues to suffer serious trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before he was transferred from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, in a deal worth $100 million, he moved to Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: the UK will forever regret the loss of carmakers
The UK would forever regret losing its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that the UK's withdrawal from the EU without a deal would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of the border delay in the event of no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if the UK left the European Union without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory would be stopped", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concern about the impact of a no-deal exit from the European Union on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of 'in real time', with parts from UK and EU suppliers for cars ordered arriving every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without a deal, this could lead to border disturbances, which industry representatives say could lead to stagnation and shortages of parts.
Toyota could not store at its factory in Derbyshire for more than one working day, company representatives said, and production would therefore be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Therese May's plan for future EU relations was well-moderated to avoid such border checks.
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the momentum of success, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The data from not only Toyote but also other manufacturers suggest that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain.
Toyota could not comment on how long production would be stopped but warned in the long run that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of Unite in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, lost jobs never come back".
The Government spokesman said: We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be rescheduled, says the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week due to the ongoing battle over Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who studies Russian arbitrary interference, the links between Trump's aides and Russia, and the potential presidential obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will fire the Attorney General's deputy, threatening Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a wiretap device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
And last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would not have pardoned Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict by hearing the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about meeting Rosenstein, she said, "There's no date yet, but it could happen this week, given everything else going on in the Supreme Court, and it could be postponed for another week.
I'll always like to keep you informed.
Some reporters would object, but Sanders hasn't called a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings was not to blame for the resistance to the establishment of TV reporters, but she said: "I can't deny that they are being set up".
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President holds more press conferences than any President before him, she said, adding, without citing the source:We have looked at the figures.
The meetings will still be held, Sanders said, but if journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their question, it is infinitely better than discussing it with me.
We're trying to make this possible as much as possible, and you've seen that we've done this a lot in the last few weeks and you'll have a conference available to you to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with state officials at guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York, this week, the president may have shown why, when he showed himself freely and somewhat bizarrely in front of a gathering of reporters.
Letter from the Minister for Health to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The Minister for Health wrote to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and their wish to continue their work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, SME, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of the EU citizens' status adjustment applications for its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'Throughout the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued, as the decision approached this autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I therefore wish to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
You can feel at home in Scotland, and we really want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of The Tennessean reported.
The head coach at Tennessee State University told reporters the injury occurred just halfway through the season.
"He came to the edge of the field and somehow got blown up", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a carrier and taking him off the field for further inspection.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris on WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "details about the type/scale of the injury are not yet known" and that Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a freshman at the university, is playing for Tennessee State University for the first time since moving from the University of Illinois.
He had a total of five hits on Saturday before he was out of the game, bringing his total strike totals for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK and the additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
Increased interest will be charged to non-paying UK taxpayers
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of interest when they buy real estate in the UK and the money raised will go to the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The argument should be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and higher taxation for high-income people.
The raised capital will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK and the additional money will stimulate government efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The fee  to be charged in addition to the current rate, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate for transmission  could be no less than 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by the introduction of the measure.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built London properties will be purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, resulting in higher prices and a harder purchase of the first property.
Many of the country's rich areas  especially the capital  have become spirit places as the number of customers spending most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the mortgage rate to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The major construction companies accused the price increases by seizing land they do not actually use and urged Ms. Mayev to waive quotas for affordable housing to repair the British housing shyness.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including a rental control and an end to forced evictions without errors.
In addition, it wants to give city councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream that life must be better for every new generation.
It also means repairing our dysfunctional housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
It cannot be true, however, that for non-UK residents and foreign companies buying a home is as easy as for UK citizens living in a garage.
For too many people, the dream of home is far too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run the Scottish Club".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points short of the top-seeded side.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Championship last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I got a B-side and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
I would only get this opportunity if I was successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic, who had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says he was not afraid to succeed such big names.
I'm trying to measure my success by asking myself, can I take this club back to the Premier League?
Given the structure and capacity, this club is undoubtedly in the Premier League, he said.
"The road to that is not easy, but it would probably be considered successful only if the club could take it back".
Ross's only been a manager for three years after serving as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped prevent the team from being relegated to League Three, and St Mirren was relegated to the Championship the following season.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than ever playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real breakthrough", he recalled taking over Alloe.
I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I was doing well as an actor, making a relatively good living, and I also achieved some greater successes.
But the game can get tough.
There are many things to deal with every week.
I still struggle with that in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I just feel like management is the right thing for me.
I've always wanted to run a club, and I'm doing it now, and I feel most comfortable in my skin in my entire adult life.

The study found that the ideal time for beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has increased the revenues of hard-to-break British pubs, but there has also been increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the CGA business adviser who prepared the data, said: Continued sunny weather and England's participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern to June last month, when pub revenue rose by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant traffic by 1.8 percent in June increased further in July.
The traffic in pubs and liquor bars increased more in comparison to the decrease in restaurant traffic.
The sunny weather also reduced sales in pubs, which mainly offer food but not as dramatically as in restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in one month and sales of food decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman of the RSM Leisure and Hospitality Analysts Group said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The main factors in the sale of the hospitality market remain the weather and the impact of large social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent drop on an annual basis will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
For food store owners, a long hot summer could not come at a more unfavorable time and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will bring the milder temperatures we experienced in August.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2,7% in July, indicating a slowdown in the introduction of the brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales benchmark in the pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data for 47 business groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is a recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
A survey has shown that one in five children, some of whom are only 11, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students revealed the growth of fake Instagram pages
News has reinforced fears about posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a parent-directed account
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - creates a social media account that he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts.
The news has reinforced fears about posting sexual-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a censored head account shown to parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally came across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter noticed that her daughter was calling on visitors to rape her.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Headmasters and Headmistresses (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 per cent of 1118 year olds have two profiles, half of whom admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: 'It is worrying that so many teens are being tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are sporting leaders to build on her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
'Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and international athletics communities, and we are confident that Scotland's athletics will gain a lot from her involvement in the committee,' said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I could recover and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows has divided online opinions
A breast pump company has shared opinions with an ad that compares mothers to cows at the hive.
To launch the market for the first portable silent breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video advertisement that is intended to show mothers all the freedom that the device offers.
Four real mothers dance in a crowded, hay-filled cowhouse on a song that includes the following: "Yes, I'm pulling, but there's no tail", and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't my tits, these are my tits".
The boy continues, "Exhaust, exhaust, feed the babies, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze the nipples".
But an ad posted on the company's Facebook website caused considerable discomfort on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was joking about the "danger" of the dairy industry.
Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and they go to the ground to produce milk, but they steal their babies from the first few days after they are born, wrote one.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly placed in the breastfeeding bladder (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are raising their children?
Someone else added, "A sound completely without feeling".
Others praised the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song "Screaming" was funny.
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it as it was intended.
This is a brilliant product, another one wrote.
Someone commented: This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who are running out of milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were dancing with hidden pumps in their bracelets.
The concept of the action is that many women who suck their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and it fits discreetly into the breastfeeding cup, allowing women to move, hold the baby, and even do some outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at the mothers' union, continued: "Elvie's hat is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.
With the parallel between milk-pumping women and cow-milkers, we wanted to bring milk-pumping and all its challenges to the spotlight, while also providing a fun way for women to connect, to showcase the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children walked on a model trail to a designer named Marto Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly relocated to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the crude rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand children over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid that their child application would jeopardize their ability to stay in the country.
The risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household family members would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80% of people, whether sponsors or household members, are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are punished foreigners.
"We are continuing to search for these individuals", said Mr Albence.
To speed up the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, the shelter workers said.
Many will appear via videoconference rather than in person to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those considered not eligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to claims by shelter workers and reports generated in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape.
Advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as the Tornillo, where signs of childhood distress are more likely to go unnoticed because of their size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without emotionally preparing them or giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to friends is a complex trauma that many of them face.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they would also deal with them accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the congregation.
Moualem said the war on terrorism in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced from their homes, was nearly over.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until we clear Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate, and blamed some Western countries for spreading unreasonable fears that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return, he said.
They are changing the political issue, which should be purely a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive renewable resources until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on ending the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a clear deadline and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be eradicated.
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, soon to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to the review of the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why will Trump win a second term?
Following this decision, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with interpelation and scandal.
Which would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
There's no sign of viewers' fatigue so far.
Since 2014, CNN's peak viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has reached the highest cable subscriber count with 3.5 million viewers per night of major news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of the drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a noted comedy writer and author of the book "Just Funny Things: and Some Hard Truths About Spying at the Hollywood Boys Club", offers a different explanation.
Remember that taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
He did, because he makes me laugh, she told me.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what's on television, the story in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
The shutdown is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet a six-hour roundtable of experts discussing the use of a source from a deep background for Bob Woodward's book, Fear, a $15,000-worth jacket made of leather (a coat, a thickly covered inflated coat, The Washington Post said) and the consequences of Trump's shocking descriptions of anatomy, khm, and the effects of the book.
For example, I'll never watch Super Maria the same way again.
"One of his most impressive feats is to offer something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Pawn Stars", about the occupation of Trump's show and the daily search scripts (a fight with the NFL, a nod to Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to release an episode or you're gonna be left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, which was 80 degrees sunshine, but he was buzzed inside watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the air.
"I remember when we were making all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Foreign money is being raised in preparation for the closest interim parliamentary elections
No wonder the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, as congressional districts have been reorganized to make two candidates run for the same seat.
This recently divided Pittsburgh suburban district is home to Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in a second district.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which is heavily overshadowed by the new 17th District.
The cards were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally vested in the Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th District touched on the campaign finance battle between the main party finance bodies, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the widely-attended March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States was considering sanctions against Salvador because of China's support, and then they pulled out.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to recall the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to withdraw recognition of Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were being considered for Salvador, which is estimated to receive US$140 million in aid in 2017, including anti-drug, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a restriction on financial aid and a targeted visa restriction, would severely affect this Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending the discussion on sanctions for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with speaking to the conference's participants, now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attributes to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard-line messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the government who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the potential for judicial interference, which is now well documented in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also expected to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia in the attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to these authorities and perhaps even to a jury of his fellow citizens just as he prepares to talk to his constituents again.
There are many questions and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we're going to have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could take.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike against Hitler if the West rebelled against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, thus missing the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
Such breakthroughs alter the course of history and accelerate or slow down the relentless march of democracy.
Americans are facing more of these breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of the Mueller investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in a state of shock since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly filming the president and speculating that he was unfit for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
What will we do if the FBI's requested investigation of Bret Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and wrongful testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress that will require Mr. Trump's accountability?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of us.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she ordered me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with swastikas.
With such a legacy, how can we not be optimistic about our future?

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic about the face of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with a clear victory over Austria in an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month putting them in a convincing position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented tied player Graham Doran from making his first appearance of the season before the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for greater achievements.
"It was a point we deserved because Villarreal are a strong team", the 31-year-old said.
We entered the game believing we could achieve something and take a point.
We might be able to play the game out of it, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better in the second half.
There's another big night in Europe on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the crowd behind us we can try and get a positive result.
It's been a tough year, no doubt, given everything that's happened, including the injuries and the changes at the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team's good and the guys are really enjoying it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, let's put the last season behind us and make it work.
Women's poor sleep due to fear of savings
Although respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people spoke to their family members about the matter.
Half of the respondents to Nationwide's survey said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't make the effort to talk about it, said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start this way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you talk to them about it in time.
Discuss with your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in estimating the cost.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles on the way.
Choose a healthcare professional by appointing a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals will take into account your health needs if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the authorization of a person for his or her finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your aging parent is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write that information down in your action plan to be prepared.
"It's not just your finances. Do you know any doctors?" asked Martin.
What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
I have this plan ready.
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a rifle.
A man who was returning home at night was shot several times with a rifle.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot multiple times in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2.30pm British time, as a "coincidence".
She didn't see her attacker's victim.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called any witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications disrupted, rescuers from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palau, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, could not obtain any information.
In Palou, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Some key information about Palu and Donggali in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island and estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a province that stretches over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, the administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi are fisheries and agriculture, especially in the central Donggala region.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the region, but it is mostly carried out in Moravia, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Relief, Palu and Donggalo have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck northern Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the earthquake-active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes occur regularly here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of India, estimated at more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern shore, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, triggering tsunamis up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake affected the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused death and panic as people recalled the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
The arrest of Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence
Trac Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest, Alaska State Troopers Police said Saturday.
According to police reports, when Palin tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she took her phone away.
Palina was arrested at Mat-Su Preaching Institute and is being held without bail for $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges against him when questioned about his defense, the network reported.
Palina was charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in jail and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with one Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time a criminal has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
My mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Indonesian tsunami earthquake: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise further in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami struck the coast, hundreds of people were stranded at the festival in the city of Palos.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare federal crime that hasn't been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was allegedly using a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan when he hit several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of death penalty petition filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, any of the charges could be the basis for the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury briefed Saipov on the 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of murder in aid of extortion, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required considerable planning and conspiracy, prosecutors said, describing Saip's method as "clever, cruel and subtle".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damián Pagnucco, is recorded in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the Southern District of New York sentenced the last man to death ten years ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but his sentence was eventually commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in a federal case in New York City in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, in the days and months following the attack, has not expressed any regrets, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
After the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
Police also said he demanded the ISIS flag be flown in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole for all those involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events", Patton said.
Saip's defense team has previously asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
The negotiations on Brexit should be entrusted to NIGEL FARAGEA, says the Tory MP
Nigel Farage, during a protest at the Tory Conference today, promised to mobilize the People's Army.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the warmth of Eurosceptics when one of her own MPs, Therese May, suggested that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would be out of the country by now if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mr. May to coordinate his deeply divided species was also highlighted by the Tories, who favored the cancellation of Brexit, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her plan in place amid attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that May in Brussels would try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull saying he wants to get rid of the Chequeress.
He said Mr Farage should be appointed as interlocutor and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in debt, we'd be out by now", he said.
This MP from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequeress".
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: In the world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.
Mr Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue".
The meeting was also attended by Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkyns, who told reporters:
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our client and our activists who are active on the streets and even leading us to the election.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.
In a message to Ms Mayve, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given a 'feel of heat' if they are to pass a decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'Now it's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,' he said.
They're trying to negotiate a Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let you do that.
In his message, he added to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to give a warmth to our political class on the brink of Brexit".
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has secured our victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the remaining men marched through Birmingham, where they held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A handful of activists have been marching with Tory flags this weekend after the group was formed.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis has ridiculed the Conservatives for security issues with the use of the party app after the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology to deal with Canada plus plus, for a border without stagnation, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a perfect farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit, he added.
Warren will be closely considering the potential for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that the presidential race will be studied closely following the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's at the center of speculation that she might be able to get along with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the "town hall" format since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren's response was that it's time to "reassure women in Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top".
Arrest after the death of LSU player Sims in a shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that they arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Way Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, 247sports reported.
Wayde got involved to protect a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to the scene at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-8-inch, Baton Rouge native, played 32 games last season with 10 starts, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton was approaching the World Championship, and the team ordered him to hand the win over to Sebastian Vettel
It became clear on Saturday, as Valtteri Boltas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team would have a major impact on the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, almost leaving Hamilton on the dry by defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettle to attack his male partner.
Vettel was the first to get into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the back of the road, which should be decisive.
Mercedes later drove into the box and left him behind Vettle, but Hamilton noticed after a few driving actions that the Ferrari driver's reluctance left the inside open and risked being left behind in the third corner after two defensive moves.
Max Verstappen started with the last line of the grid and finished seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he spent most of the race driving without changing tyres, as he planned to finish fast, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally made his way to the boxer's court in round 44, but he was unable to speed up the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Walter was driving fantastically all weekend and he was a real knight when he let me through.
The team did a really remarkable job of getting first and second place, Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body talk.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for insisting she did not disclose letters from Supreme Court Justice Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president didn't directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, but instead said what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil, corrupt and lying".
"The only nice thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is that we can see anger when we can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying", he said.
When you look at the revelations and the revelations, people say, "No, I didn't do that".
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... you uncovered the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't reveal it.
All right, wait a minute.
We've revealed it to us... no, we haven't, he added about the impression on the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked to the media in early September, but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not disclose her letter", she told the committee after The Hill Feinstein reported.
She asked me to keep her confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.
But her denial clearly did not suit the chairman who said at a meeting on Saturday night, "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but it was the worst body gossip I've ever seen.
In his defense of a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were abusing the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to regain their power by any means possible.
You've seen the evil, the disgust, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to take away to beat themselves to power and control, the president reportedly said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars to Belfast Giants, 5 to 3.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have redeemed themselves for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led early for two goals on the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for home field, then Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two of Lundwald Nielsen's goals secured a win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 from the backfield on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal of the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 to assist Kendall McFaul, and Beauvillier, who hit four minutes later, was handed it to David Rutherford.
In an intense introductory effort, Sullivan led the home side back into the game at 1:10 p.m. and Matt Marquardt gave Cowni a tie at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer led the Giants in the rest of the season, hitting his second goal of the evening at the end of the first quarter.
The home side was back together, and Bouchard made up for the loss with a strong 27-37 goal.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen lead Dundee to a lead at the end of the second quarter and secured the win with his team's fifth goal in halftime and secured the win with his team's fifth goal in the bottom half of the third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at their home in Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller has killed hundreds of people on board, enabling them to escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after sacrificing his life to make the flight with hundreds of people safe.
The tsunami-affected Sulawesi earthquake on Friday killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in the heavily-built control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in it to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower, thinking he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian media outlet ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Paul.
"Our hearts break when we hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, as the National Disaster Relief Agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as there were many bodies under the rubble, many of which we could not reach", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The funeral home for the mass will be destroyed by waves up to six metres high.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings a body.
There's a lack of clean water.
Minimalist shops are everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse.
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau and urged the national army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? According to CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes in Lombok struck Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one person is missing after the plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one person is missing after initially reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday they took seven people to the hospital.
The airline said eight passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have announced that the plane landed in a lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the piston.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That's incredibly good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water reaching its waist to the emergency exits on a sinking plane.
He said the stewards panicked and screamed, but he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were repairing nearby docks also jumped in to help, using a floating boat to carry people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in air accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
Analyst determined the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors presented evidence in a retrial Saturday to a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how they used phone records to determine the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from multiple cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was lying because it was [my] truck in Nashville.
The second inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The footage on their cell phone shows they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that at the time of Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the jury was expected to rule on the trial later that day.
What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the genre's negative image by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip-hop has moved away from its original political and social commitment.
They want to get back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues a couple for firing her for a "racistic" message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misspelled message from a mother who complained she was another black woman.
The couple denies racist behaviour and compares the lawsuit to rape.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
"I'm not sure if there's a black woman", she wrote in a message to her husband, Plasco-Flaxman.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After finding out about her undercurrent, Plasco-Flaxmanova, who felt "uncomfortable", fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, an African-American, was doing poorly and wanted to hire a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she and Uber were sent home.
Maurice is now seeking compensation from the couple in court, in the amount of $350 per day for a six-month period, for the work she was originally hired to do, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, you know, that this is not the way to do things", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations of racism by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after being sad.
His wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, "Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
Would you be willing to entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was done wrong?
Your newborn?
Let's go.
Comparing the lawsuit to the deportation, Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to treat someone like that?
That's not very nice, "added the investment banker.
Although the court case is still ongoing, the court quickly condemned the social media couple's behavior and way of thinking.
The creators of the Paddington bear story were afraid that readers would not connect with the talking bear, a new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to put up with someone who's read the book for the first time before it's even published.
It's a lot of fun to know now that Paddington has become a huge hit.
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little toy bear, was upset by the rejection of his work, adding that after his death last year was the 60th anniversary of the book grenko-sweet.
Regarding the Paddington bear, who she described as a very important member of our family, she said that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man who didn't like to brag", she said.
But because the Paddington Bear was so real to him, it was almost like your child was accomplishing something: you're proud of him, even if you're not really doing it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed the success to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say she felt really bad, that she didn't expect this to happen", said Ednan-Laperouse.
And then I got a call from Nad, and he told me that she was gonna die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications her doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly took over and left her system.
She was dying a while ago, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold out.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I had my head bent and tears were running down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this silent feeling of compassion for Hope on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning Women Stick Posters to Prevent Suicide on the Bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to turn others away to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are hanging up on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room.
But before he died, he stopped working because it was a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found the baby boy when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered".
Mrs. Davis made posters to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Don't sit quietly. You need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who was Davies' longtime friend, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was on the ground on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that.
She said his death was a major trauma for them, but they had to deal with it:
She tore us apart.
But we must go on and fight.

The future of Bret Kavanaugh hangs in the air as the FBI investigations begin.
"I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for, after a lengthy and limited investigation, that might unite us", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world would collapse because of the firmly established party impasse.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is a result of the time it would take to investigate.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections. If Republicans are expected to lose poorly, it will weaken them greatly in their bid to elect the man they want to be on the state's highest court.
George W. Bush has repeatedly called the Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and was introduced by Mr. Bush to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, the vice president, a breakthrough from the bench and a Supreme Court nomination.
The number of North Korean refugees has declined under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, said that 1127 people were displaced last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tightening border controls between North Korea and China and the price hike demanded by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not commented on this publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are crossing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross as a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the outcome of denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on a general effort to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho blamed the US sanctions for a backlog since then.
"Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm", Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has labeled Bret Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and says he's not fit for the Supreme Court job.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has labeled Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is characteristically unfit for a Supreme Court job.
Pelosieva said that in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of anything else but to label a woman who behaves like this as 'hysterical,'" Pelosi commented on Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking on discussions about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and called the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated smear" organized by the Liberals, angered by Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosieva said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not be nominated for the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased toward the Democrats.
"I think he discredited Clinton and the Democrats with his statements and the way he treated them", she said.
Pelosi's question as to whether she will attempt to file a constitutional lawsuit against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives is for now.
"If Congress or the FBI don't tell the truth, it's inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court it's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosiva said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'", Pelosieva said.
And the woman's got to be wrapped.
It's a just outcome, after months and years of pouring out anger, and she can't express it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", she told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's rare, do you?
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a director, who also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which is when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as an escape from anger in part because people misunderstand them.
One of the strongest memories of my early career, when I was working in a male-dominated office, and I once found myself crying in unspeakable anger, was the moment when an older woman grabbed me by the neck, a cold leader, who was always a little scared, and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They won't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad you're being beaten.
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the race, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply saddened to find that there was no reason why she could not run for president alone.
"It was not a well thought out decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
Seven other candidates had already entered the competition, and one more was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone called the game "Snowflake and the Seven Bullets" back then.
Since the latter joined the campaign, she lagged behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the contest unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a conversation that she would not run an official campaign, her feelings were overcome by  gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism  that she was suffocating.
"They'd think I had a nervous breakdown", she recalled, "and she remembered the media reaction".
They'd think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my grave.
Was she crying?
How a U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial outbursts of the U.S.-China trade war were daunting, and although the battle is far from over, experts say the gap between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated with equivalent retaliatory measures, most recently tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China, the world's second-largest economy, has pledged to face the United States eye-to-eye and is not likely to slow down anytime soon.
In order for Washington to give in, China should accept its demands, but a public US removal would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can take the right steps, U.S. trade war pressure could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The idea that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic shocks in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers had previously thought", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready for refugee return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer as a result of the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country by terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the USA team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of captain Thomas Bjorna of Denmark scored 14.5 points to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled through most of the championship, threw the ball into the water on the 16th hole in a par-3 game on his opening shot, forcing him to hand the game over to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been a fixture in all competitions, becoming one of only four players to have scored 5-0-0 since the tournament's inception in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The eight-time Ryder Cup winner, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the most successful European player of all time with 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
This year has been hard.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for lifting me up and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy we won the trophy again.
It's a team and I'm really glad I could help", Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He's handing over the bat to fellow American John Ram who won the two-on-one individual golf championship on Sunday over American golf legend Tiger Woods.
"I feel incredibly proud to have been able to beat Tiger Woods.
Woods has lost all four games he's played in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
That's an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been working tirelessly all week to find the right course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played golf at the highest level all season long.
After a poor performance for his team, the American captain said, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought.
We've been pressing Europe for a moment this morning.
We got it.
- Put your hat down before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Keep your head down.
They've outplayed us.
Red tide news: Concentration on the shores of Pinellas, Manatee and Saratoga counties is decreasing
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
The FWC Commission has reported more widespread flowering in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Saratoga, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide extends for about 130 miles from the northern coast of Pinellas County to the southern counties of Lee.
The wreckage was visible about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red spots have also been seen in Pasco County.
Last week, moderate concentrations were reported in Pinellas County and its coastline, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County, baseline to high concentrations in Manatee County, baseline to high concentrations in Saratoga County and its coastline, baseline to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, baseline to high concentrations in Lee County and its coastline, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No reports of breathing irritation from Northwest Florida last week.
