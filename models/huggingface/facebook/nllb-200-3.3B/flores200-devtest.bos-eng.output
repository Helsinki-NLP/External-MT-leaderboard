Although an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the death rate from Ebola, it has not yet been clearly demonstrated that any drug is suitable for treating this infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially seemed promising, but official studies have shown less benefit than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, which means that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to three other therapies.

Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a known theory, but it allows for details that fossils usually can't provide, such as colour and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on the top, with a pale or yellow-orange-red underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed feature called a tail, but have other feather features - spines and tiny spikes - researchers concluded that tail feathers are likely a later evolutionary development than other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature or appearance regulation.
Studies have shown that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows adult feathers and not chickens.
A car bomb detonated yesterday at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding more than 20 others.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect an alleged Daesh militant was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars, and that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation together are used to determine the Rosebud number of the star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rosby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field inversions.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to mimic observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls the Earth and causes the tide to rise, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Arrow galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter is found around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and it's made up of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of TB (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very problematic and alarming because of its high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll thinks some of the patients may have contracted the bug in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital health workers.

Their thermal behavior is not as consistent as large caverns on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing, a member of the Astrogeological team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is done without technology, with voters isolating themselves in a booth and putting a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope to indicate the candidate they want to vote for.
After the official confirms the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.
These procedures are quite strictly regulated by the French electoral law.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be witnesses that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are put in the box by those who have been duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process, and in the evenings, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the sheriff's court in Edinburgh, charged with the murder of his son.
She's in custody pending charges and trial, but any witness evidence can be denied because her picture has been published so many times.
It's a regular practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law works differently and the courts have considered it possible that publishing the photograph could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists really walk a fine line when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is solely responsible for the criminal prosecution, has indicated to the press that no further comment will be given, at least until the indictment is filed.
The document, according to leaked information, will address the border dispute that Palestine wants to base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics allegedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, which is a problem in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA accepts a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control pilot program should have been under the watchful eye of the ranger, since the pilot program was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of NSW, qualified volunteers have been recruited, in accordance with the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), nine members took the oath of office before Martelly.
It's Martelly's fifth C.E.P. in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed that the previous CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Violent protests have been triggered at times by the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod overheating, causing a total of six fires and minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had information on 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company says is "not serious".
The department responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m. GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands has announced that there has been no reported damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami indicator.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children, elderly people and photographers from the Philippines.
Photographers later took over the elderly lady's place when she needed to use the bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the Auckland State Hospital for Women.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he spent his spare time researching premature birth.
His research showed that the administration of the hormone will accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" for recording data during the flight on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and she died at the age of two months, pretty unique, just like her, a strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented "The Moon was as strange as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I will miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose 8 percent since 2008.
As part of the campaign for the 2010 federal election, the Prime Minister of the transitional government Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those polled who wish Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
The poll showed two extreme views: 29 percent of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three stages of the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in question due to an appeal.
He couldn't take the medication needed to relieve the pain because those drugs are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February using various hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of bringing water to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors political chatter and nonsense.
He's been rumored to be running for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of obsolete ground-based radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport will be included and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and bus shelters are not available near the stadium.
Fear of a lack of transportation has increased the likelihood that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without team fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science made claims about the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden say that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's toad, Geospize forte, and the migratory cactus toad, Geospizeiros contris.
Gold can be made into many shapes, and it can be wrapped in small forms.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be wound and entwined, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH value of a chemical substance, and you can make an indicator using the juice of a red cabbage.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is represented by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders, then clean with wet hands and make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will lead to a strange feeling and create a kind of protection.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would mingle together in a mixed society.
When you call someone who's miles away, you use satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
Space scientists use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and views.
To place a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lost pet cats) that eat much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special skill that every cat possesses and that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats and they live in large groups called packs.
The flock is made up of one to three adult males in the family and as many as thirty females and young.
The women are usually closely related to each other because it's a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and also very deadly to their prey.
Like a true athlete of many sports, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, leopard and jaguar, and these are the only four cats that can bark.
The tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar, but more like a sentence of angry shouts.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals, and if it can, it will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals it preys on are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate prey by scent by sniffing out the ground where the prey has been.
They have very good night vision, and they move very quietly, and they hunt their prey by blending in with their environment, and then they jump on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, when crossing a mountain range or river, or when it moves to a new island, so that it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in an environment different from the one in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, to be a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptations from what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce food by photosynthesis with the help of the sun.
We use plants to build our homes and make our clothes, and most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, fearing nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contained over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra row of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no salvation for any creature that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that she had a tongue, her diet included turtles, large fish, other molasses, and she may have even been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't keep up with it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also feasted on some strange or unusual foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called the puff
Another difference was that, while poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have banquets together where they lazed on their hips while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included food that had come to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their deities, which was considered the home of that deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that could only be accessed by the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziguratis, are built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open cash registers facing the street.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimos already lived there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a map to the treasure.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and the text is written backwards at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was sealed and placed in the archives at the very beginning.
So it's possible that the note was added simply as a tag.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
The north of France was ruled by the French of the Visigoths, who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and refers to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which in some ways defines the size of society.
Civilization culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural traces and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence and without being recognized as true civilizations.
Under the Articles of Confederation, during the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, whose only component was the Congress.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state agencies to enforce the laws, which were often uncooperative.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The members sought the full consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states understood the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
The cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called an archipelago from a geographical perspective.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors noted the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiated a change in aboriginal grain production practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
Qing dynasty forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
In Machu Picchu there are three main buildings - Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better view of what they looked like originally.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image format in the world is 35 mm, which dominated the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, the format of the display is taken from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing - 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Thus, the ratio of the ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of the whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this scale of proportions.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in the picture.
It is stated that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under control.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite their different languages and customs.
Its dominant power affected everyone - from kings to common men.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds serve that very purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has many people wondering if this rule is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in disrupting the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violates internationally accepted law codified in several international treaties from the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering parts of the oceans, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited warfare under the sea.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he had accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with a 4-cent note in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Each phase in Chinese history or each family that was in power was a recognizable dynasty.
The most famous such period was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the top spot in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to the ruler.
Also, after the revolutionary occupations were opened up to all male claimants, it allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of military ranks being ranked by class, they're now ranked by caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond this earthly life. He often spent time in the cave that became known as Hira on the mountain Noor (light) and meditated.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if someone knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or necropolis of Giza in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to a series of pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, temples and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward" designation looks like a V, and the "downward" designation looks like a connecting or square with the bottom missing.
Up means you have to start from the top and push the hammer, and down means you have to start from the frog (where your hand holds the hammer) and pull the hammer.
The upward swaying sway usually produces a softer sound, while the downward swaying is louder and more declarative.
You may write your own markings in pencil, but remember that the markings of the gudala are for the purpose of music, and must be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who screamed and shouted threats at the king and queen.
A mob of men forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriages wide open.
At one point, a mob member waved his head at a member of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and interest on the bonds they had launched in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the primary gain of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the founding of the order.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally dated to about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from a technological impulse or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by a basic logic connected to the laws of science and their representation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology in turn has "outsiders" in societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a greater number of road accidents, which leads to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with these geographical areas emerged and these, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renowned epicentre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more prized than anything the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the major developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was when people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that aims to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds from a particular eco-region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient in agricultural production, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar worldviews who feel that social norms are ignoring them and allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that make a subculture different may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often show their affiliation through specific and symbolic use of style, which implies fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point to several unfortunate cases of children who were denied socialization by adults in their development due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse.
Some wild children were incarcerated (usually by their parents); in some cases, children were rejected because their parents rejected their serious intellectual or physical deficiencies.
Abandoned children may have gone through violence or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
The others are thought to have been raised by animals, some are thought to have lived independently in the wild.
After being fully raised by nonhuman animals, a feral child displays behavior (within physical limits) that closely resembles the behavior of the animal that cared for it, such as fear and indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The help can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of help but also a little human stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in software and are intended to test, instruct and explain procedures that could pose a challenge to the student who needs to perform them independently.
Children enter the foster system for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where there is no care, no tenderness, no education, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care should fill all the needs that were unmet in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access, benefits and satisfaction of needs.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
When researching audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified personal involvement and continued connection as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting the microexpressions, it can be detected whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, The Presidential Address, suggested that people who can't understand a speech because of brain damage can still properly evaluate sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has pointed to the fact that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection is the removal of a group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between those two bases in each generation.
A primate with a digestive system like humans, in the savanna it can be difficult to meet the amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so can lead to serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins available in leaves and pulses, but they're difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (turtles, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a vast amount of protein containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and then going back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, which will cause the person to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is the opposite of the amount of tension in the body and spirit of the person.
The less tension there is, the more positive life force there is, and each person has the potential to find their absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
In kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, and through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes and cultures led to disagreements between countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be conducted in real time, via proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were virtually rendered obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Peace of Riga Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large amounts of goods and large numbers of people across the ocean.
The Navy's job is traditionally to make sure that the country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, and at the same time to interfere with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to provide aid to Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mostly using U-boats, was trying to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were most commonly kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by Cossacks, mostly children or adolescents, who are similar to today's shepherds.
Wagons were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to pull more cargo than was possible on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Railroad sills were introduced early on to secure railroad tracks, but it was gradually realized that railroads would be much more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
It became common practice, but the iron caused a greater wear of the wooden wheels of the carriage.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and the first full-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known transportation was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Bipedal specialization has been observed in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and remove it.
Clearly, the world has changed quite a bit because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been made worse by overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap Printing House.
Between 150 and 200 were made in the night, today known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8th, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap posters are the oldest known copies of this document, the original handwritten copy of which has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs for the reason that they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with spokes and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two possible values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal context for this group of insects.
This term comes from an ancient familiarity with mites, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common cockroaches are scavengers, adapted to live in the nest or living quarters of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease of younger adults and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise the baby.
These couples can make the decision to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and in fact, this is the method that most scientific research is based on.
However, it's not just experimenting, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, but also to ask questions and make observations that also lead to scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in a wide range of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the flask with radioactive phosphorus or they labeled the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the particular part of the genetic material and whether the cells affected are placental cells.
Only mutations in the host cells can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns on the outskirts and go to their jobs, passing by those who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive, a transport system that is based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high-carbon economy has thrown the biosphere out of one of its steady states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges that are falling apart.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is impossible to predict with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave quite consistently, so traffic has a kind of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, links are established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators and search for food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings back today are the fairy horses and the water lilies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but most believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars), moves around the earth.
It sounds reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it has more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
The full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 kilometers long, and it collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size and technical perfection.
The new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the common language spoken by the majority of the country's employees, while Latin is often used in religious services.
All the Vatican's residents are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily exploited using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything was made from a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also had the theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
And don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many after it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing styles, the pencil has fallen into a lower status and is used less frequently.
People now write messages on computers and never have to get a sharpener for a pen.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with a mass of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy wheelchair uphill, and then splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas, thicker under the mountains.
On the near side, there may be more of the maria because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what makes people behave or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have evolved during maturation into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is that makes some people want what they do and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two types of behavior that can occur when managers start leading their former peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks and demanding accountability from employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has been working on and make it their own.
After all, it's the leader who ultimately bears responsibility for both the team's success and its failure.
This kind of behavior often results in disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, yet there are no small differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than other team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is the management team to which each member is accountable.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing the concept of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiology data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, and therefore, they narrow the field of study and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Advances in new technologies allow us to observe and explore brain structures and processes never before seen.
This gives us a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
While artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction context, it represents an extremely important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to provide answers to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that are focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
Today, AI systems are widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are incorporated into several home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are a big part of every classroom, and oftentimes, a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours, where students can look at artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
A virtual trip is also a great way to look back on the trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, and the web page changes every year, but the old versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing skills.While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to look for ways to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "encourages students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to uplift the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others are writing and can express their own opinion on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The city of Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, home to a multitude of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the untapped natural beauties of Musco and other areas.
All of this and much more makes Ontario what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
The vast areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some represent almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or linked to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to those countries, which was particularly strong on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, without regard to actual marital status.
It might help if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to something they would consider harassment and it is not unusual for someone to follow them, hold their hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stick to your position (cultural differences notwithstanding, it is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baj, and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases on the site.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as pasta, pottery, leather goods, nargles and a whole spectrum of geomags, but it is all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by a volcanic eruption, which flooded most of the city streets, especially in the downtown area.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
This city is also the starting point for the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest mountain gorilla climbs in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
Due to the fact that it is rather inaccessible, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a city of poverty, though its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport make it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world cultural sites, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS special The Wonders of the African World hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the southern border formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which support different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, the park has daily maintenance and entry fees.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card to enter some parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider a major destination.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong is linked to a glowing graph that is visible thanks to the presence of the Victoria Harbour water.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon Harbour on the other side.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is densely settled on the land along the north coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, you can start here.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Yet the forests are more than salt marshes - they include some of the last remaining of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which almost one-third of the area is covered by water/wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that some 400 royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 deer live in the area today.
Buses leave from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese buses.
Shared taxi rides are a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyjapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters in height, are 378 meters long and have two strips that are 3.50 meters wide.
The freeway under the bridge is 15 metres high and was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous community in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and engaged in self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and the Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering fruits and fishing.
Paraguay, whose earlier name was the "Wild Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here and at any other time of the year, you can watch small tournaments and games.
For news on tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo matches, check with Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal to the value of one British pound (GBP).
In the islands, money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, across the street from FIC West.
British pounds will be accepted everywhere in the islands, and credit cards and American dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand for acceptable payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but due to the combination of wind and humidity, it appears to be colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human encounters, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or harassed.
The park's owners say to stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Despite their appearance of obedience, bison, moose, deer, mice, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval stand-off in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of the Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is bordered by two harbours. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run along Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and many are sheltered by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in the Port of Waitemata, in the suburbs of Upper Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops that provide shorefront.
The main local beer is Number 1, and it's not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea is "straight white coffee" side, the short black is "espresso", the cappuccino is topped with lots of cream (not froth), and the tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
There are trips to the reef all year round, and reef injuries are rare.
Still, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The Kubomudays appear near the beach and river mouth from October to April, north of the town of 1770.
Sharks do, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles don't live in the ocean all the time, but their primary habitat is the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind because he knows that he will have accommodations once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, although you can see that other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, can be booked through the agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you want to reconsider the offer or extract other necessary documents for travel to that destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors find that an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to take a camping spot near the music.
Remember that while the music content on the main stages is finished, there may be some parts of the festival that will play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin position because crossing the ice makes a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruise to Saint Petersburg includes time spent in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the money and time spent by guests, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them in the facilities.
In some places, alcohol is served on the house's doorstep, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitude or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and it is not possible to drive as on clear asphalt.
During blizzards, you can get stuck in a snowstorm very quickly.
Visibility may be limited by falling snow or hail or condensation or ice appearing on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many lands, and traffic generally continues to flow smoothly throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to see the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and standard equipment will give you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better if you look through your rearview mirror.
A safari walk (also known as a walk through the bush, a safari hike, or a hike) consists of hiking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some sporting events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics since it hosted one in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the standard ticket costing about 7,000 yen.
In many hotels, it is possible to borrow a brush and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If a peg is not available or you do not like to wear socks with a peg, you can try using a fen if one is available.
Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective depending on the specific threat.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they've never seen in their own backyards.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, are not usually classed as pests.
Shopping at duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy products that are exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers to countries where high tax rates are in force can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as the road often passes through isolated woodlands.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and steep curves.
The speed limits set are noticeably lower than on the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, cell reception here is much stronger than at many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those made by their southern neighbours, the Austrians.
Fruit baking is common - apples are baked in a batter all year round, and cherries and plums are produced in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes often make a good combination with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try the pastry that, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. Coconut milk is often used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional gastronomy that is present throughout the nation.
But when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually denotes food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, features a range of simply spicy dishes. The dominant flavors that Javanese people like are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The shoulder straps are the supports for the rider's feet, which are on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but they can cause safety problems because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse and his foot remains in the stirrup, the horse could pull him back in case he starts running.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a flat heel and a fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety levers that allow the leather straps to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls them in the fall.
In the Cochamó Valley - a top-ranked climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America - there are various large granite walls and crevices.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes through its endless potential walls.
Snowsports that involve descending a steep slope, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you descend a snow-covered terrain on skis or boards that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main passenger activity of many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "skiing nerds", who plan entire vacations in terms of skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
