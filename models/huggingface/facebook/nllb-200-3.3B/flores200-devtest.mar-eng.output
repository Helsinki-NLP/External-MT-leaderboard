Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely held, but it also gives us details that are not possible in the fossil record, such as color and 3-D arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal has chestnut-brown coloration on the upper surface and a light grey coloration on the inside.
The discovery also provides information about the evolution of the bird's fly.
Dinosaur scales do not have a rod called an aura, but they do have other features of scales - cones and contromics - and scientists have speculated that the aura is more likely to have evolved at a later stage in gene development than other features.
The structure of the tail suggests that it was not used for combat but was used to control or display temperature. The researchers suggest that although this is a small dinosaur's tail, the specimen is an adult tail, not a pup.
The researchers suggested that even though this was a small dinosaur tail, the sample was an adult urine sample and not a pup.
Two police officers were killed and twenty others were injured in a car bomb attack on police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The group was looking at the effects of the forces of gravity between dark matter in the Milky Way and dark matter in the galaxy.
Just as gravity between the Moon and the Earth causes the ocean to rise, so there is gravity between the Milky Way and the Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to demonstrate that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that the darkest matter around the galaxy is located in a kind of luminous cavity around the galaxy and is made up of numerous small particles.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict security, following the usual procedure.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with a face veil.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver escaped with a serious head injury.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then moved back to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Akodia has since been remanded in custody by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, charged with the murder of her son.
She is charged and her case is pending, but since her photograph has been widely published, the eyewitness evidence may be flawed.
While this is common practice elsewhere in the UK, Scotland's justice system operates differently and courts have seen the publication of the photos as potentially prejudicial.
"Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, reported that 'journalists are treading a dangerous line if they publish photos of a suspect, etc.' "
The Crown Office, which is the overall lead on the prosecution, has informed reporters that no comment will be made until the next indictment is filed.
The leaked document would refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-Civil War 1967 borders.
Other topics included allegedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Once the agreement was signed, Israel demanded that the current military base in the valley be maintained for 10 years, while the PA agreed that it should be maintained for only 5 years.
The shooter in the Auxiliary Pest Control test was closely monitored by the Ranger while the test was being observed and evaluated for usefulness.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth CEP in four years for Martelli.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent resolutions are triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have not occurred since 2011.
There have been six reported incidents of fire in the premises and four people suffering minor burns, with a total of 60 iPods that were reported to have malfunctioned and overheated.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overwriting incidents, which the company termed ""non-Sirius""".
"The Ministry has reacted to Apple's delay in the reporting of the report as ""really regrettable"".
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday night 09:19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no casualties anywhere in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Information Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has kidnapped a busload of Hong Kong tourists and put them in the Philippines capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued and at least 6 deaths have been reported.
Six of the hostages, including children and elderly persons, were released as soon as the Filipino photographer.
The photographer took the place of the elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in the medical field.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in her spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone is given, it can accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators seized two 'black boxes' of flight recorders.
The performers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the queen of the fairy tale, my first manager, Luna 2 the night of the moon, the only one like her who was capable.'"
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented that ""Luna was as weird as I was...maybe even more so...I love her and I will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place""".
Of the 1,400 people who voted ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she wanted Australia to become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled said that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Turning to the polling stance, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and 3 relay in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical fitness was considered questionable due to his complaints.
Due to his ban from the sport, he was unable to take medication to help with his pain.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime.
Several people have been using various hardware and software since early February to verify the findings, which were announced on Tuesday.
Comets are likely to be sources of water supply to Earth, along with organic matter that can make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, when a comet struck the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumours 'political nonsense and nonsense'.
He was expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the Nestgen system will allow aircraft to fly on short-distance routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions annually.
It uses satellite-based technology to provide more precise guidance to air traffic controllers, aircraft and pilots, as opposed to the previous ground-based radar-based technology.
No additional traffic is being made and there will be no overground trains stopping at Wembley and no car parking, park-and-ride facilities will be available at the ground.
Fears of miscommunication have increased the likelihood of being forced to play behind closed doors without supporters of the sports team.
An observation on the creation of new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Gal√°pagos Islands was published in the journal Science on Thursday.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have said that the new species evolved in just two weeks, but the process is likely to take longer due to breeding among native Darwin's finch, Geospiza forts, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conyrostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be rolled up and made into a sheet, which can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It could be made so small and embedded in other metals that it was used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "adorned manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH, and you can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The proportion of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical is indicated by the pH level.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons.
Mix 2 dry powders together and then with clean wet hands grind them into a ball.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel good and create a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house had a flush toilet system, which was connected to a state-of-the-art sewage system.
The remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese also had toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared the same space.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite is contacted and answered almost immediately.
This satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with the light and vision we need.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket more than 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is make transportation easier and faster.
This gave us railways, cars and many other modes of transport.
They have more medium-sized cats inside, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, each cat's special function that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called pridees.
A pride is made up of one to three related adult males, plus up to 30 females and juveniles.
Women are usually very close to each other, sisters and daughters forming a large family.
Groups of lions often behave like packs of animals that bear a striking resemblance to their lions and dogs (not just other big cats) and are extremely deadly to their predators.
A well-trained tiger can climb (not very good, of course), swim, leap for long distances, and pull with five times the force of a healthy man.
The tiger is a member of the same species (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar. Only these four cat species can break their jaws.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion's full voice, but more like the phrase of words uttered in a roar.
The ossilators prefer small animals, and if possible, they catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds, all of which are smaller than the ossilators.
Scientists think that oselots hunt animals for food, to see where they are on the ground, and to find them by their scent.
They can see very well in the dark and can move with ease with their stealthy footsteps.
When a small group of individuals (a small population) separates from their original population, (such as when they migrate across a mountain range or river or when they settle on a new island they cannot easily turn back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In these new environments, with new resources and new competitors, the new population may require different characteristics or adaptations than previously required to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed, they still need to adapt to the old ones.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less like other populations.
After all, even after thousands or millions of years, two populations look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process "breeding", which simply means the creation of new species. Breeding is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans use to breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans expel by exhalation (breathing).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to make our homes and our clothes, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and animals cannot live without plants.
The mosasaurus was the greatest predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was filled with more than 70 sharp teeth, an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning it had no escape for anyone who came in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a spiny tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't match it.
Most of their food may be familiar, but the Romans featured in their banquets a variety of exotic and unusual foods, including wild boar, moose, swallows, and a type of rat called the door mouse.
Another difference was that whereas the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men preferred to eat together, where they enjoyed their meals in comfort.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that came to America or Asia and then to Europe in the following centuries.
For example, they don't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa powder, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People bring objects to offer to the gods, priests try to fulfill the needs of the gods through festivals and ceremonies.
Each temple has an open courtyard and only priests can enter the inner chamber.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of these temples.
The top of the tower was a special shelter for the deity.
In the warm atmosphere of the Middle East, home was not very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of its life in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; store counters were open on the street; houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan was not covered with forests, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland became a rare inhabited region, and in the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for slaughter, and after traveling a little further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', the people, kings, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland differ greatly.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even though there's something written on the back of this document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words, ""The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". This text appears at the bottom of the document, in the opposite direction".
No one knows who wrote it, but what is known is that in its early life, large parchment documents (ranging from 29 3/4 inches to 24 1/2 inches) were brought in for storage.
So, it may be that this notation should be just labeled.
The D-Day landings and subsequent wars gained independence in the north of France, but not yet in the south.
"It was ruled by the 'Wichy' French, who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of going to war".
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was known as 'Operation Dragoon.'"
In just two weeks, American and French Free Forces had liberated the south of France and turned toward Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a large community of people living and working together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin citizen, meaning citizen, and is related to the Latin citrus, meaning citizen, and civis, meaning city or city-state, and it also defines to some extent the extension of society.
The city-state was the precursor of the nation-state, and in a civilized civilized culture, it implies a transition of knowledge across generations, a creeping cultural step and a proper distribution.
Small civilizations often die without having any relevant historical evidence and fall short of being recognized as a proper civilization.
As the Revolutionary War was going on, the Thirteen States formed a weak centralized government - only Congress was an important part of it - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to enforce taxes, and with no national executive or judiciary, they relied on state officials, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all their laws.
He had no power to override the tax laws between the states.
The amendment of the Act required unanimous consent of all the States and the States did not take the Central Government seriously at all, its representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is a cluster of about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu) which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
"Because of the clusters of islands that make up Japan, Japan is often referred to as an 'island' from a geographical point of view".
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in northwestern Taiwan, changing the indigenous grain production system and employing Chinese labor to cultivate rice and sugar.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces captured parts of the western and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded its claim to Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of 3 main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of what the original buildings looked like.
By 1976, Machu Picchu had been restored by 30 percent, and the restoration is still going on today.
For example, the most common steel image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant size of the last film of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but the important thing is that its aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (simply divided by the bar to get the ratio of the most integer) is understood to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family formats) are similar to or close to this aspect ratio.
The very rigid and often-ridiculous rule of thirds are simple guidelines that create dynamics when measuring sequences in a photograph.
This suggests that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become prosperous and powerful, began to be scrutinized.
For thousands of years, Christianity has held the European states together, despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipotence impressed everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth is suffering and should be used to end poverty, and the church's funds are for the same purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether this doctrine even existed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated generally accepted international laws, codified by many international treaties over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective in reducing significant military and civilian supplies.
The UK has built a tunnel in international waters to block ships from entering an entire section of the ocean.
As the tactic received limited response, Germany expected its unrestricted submarine warfare to have the same response.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of peace and non-alignment.
After witnessing the atrocities and horrors of the First World War, all countries expressed the desire that such situations should be avoided in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with a 4-cent bill in his hand and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachler (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing time; each stage or ruling family of China was a particular clan.
There was also a period of instability of the separate provinces during each dynasty. The best known of these was the period of the 3 dynasties, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were many wars between rival kingdoms.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for supremacy in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from anarchy to democracy, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not the ruler.
Even after the revolution, many business opportunities were available to these male applicants, to allow the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same is true for the military, because the seniority in the military will be based on skill instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life, and he frequented a cave on the mountain known as 'Nur' (the light) to gain knowledge.
He spent a long time in the cave, which provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on a mountain range north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, it's not easy to find, because once you're inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of this world, nothing more than the surrounding mountains and the beautiful clear sky above.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and The Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's concubines and family members.
The "up bo" mark looks like a V and the "down bo" mark looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
So you start at the top and you slide the bow forward, and then you start at the bottom of the frog, where you're holding the bow in your hand, and you pull the bow.
Up-bo usually produces a soft sound, while down-bo is stronger and more emphatic.
Use a separate pencil to alter your own symbols, but remember that these are printed bow symbols for musical purposes, so they usually need to be given importance.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis-Charles, four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women from the market on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, he traveled back to Paris in a crowd of people shouting and yelling dangerously against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the crowd killed the royal guard of Versailles and danced his head in front of the frightened queen.
The war of US imperialist victory over the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American imperial system to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
In other words, the greater gains derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will be the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the Order.
The period of time in which the events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technology determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas, from the practical to the tech-push or tech-spected in the strict sense of human destiny driven by fundamental logic that deals with scientific laws and the expression of technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path of cultural or political influence, and that in turn technology has ""effects"" on societies that are, rather than socially occurring, inherent in it".
For example, we might say that the development of roads was made possible by the automobile.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically feasible for a few cars, so many new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of the car.
The high car ownership rate also contributes to the high rate of road accidents, which requires healthcare to find new technologies to repair injured bodies.
Cultural determination was a big factor in romanticism, as argued by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In terms of humanity, geography shaped people and over time, the customs and culture that were associated with that area and were compatible with that society were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was once known as the fashion capital of the European Union.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the return of gifts such as silk and spices accepted by the Crusaders, which were worth more than the value offered by the Byzantine markets.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th - 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Early Eastern Byzantine culture had a strong influence on dress.
But, because of the slow pace of the media, the Western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the great developments of that era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is the farming that is done to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family and to produce enough food.
Crop farming is a simple, often organic, system in which the original preserved seeds are used in the conditions, along with re-crops or other relatively simple techniques for increased production.
Historically, many farmers have been farming for a living and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ due to age, ethnicity, status, location and/or gender of the members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be language, aesthetic, religious, gender, geography or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture show their membership in a variety of different and symbolic styles, which include fashion, customs, and dialect.
One of the most common ways we use to illustrate the importance of socialization is to tell some unfortunate stories of young children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, are not included in the adult population as they grow up.
"Some of the wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents have abandoned them because they rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical disability".
Abusive children are more likely to experience child abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have been left in the wild by their own choice.
The behavior of a child raised by animals other than humans (within the physical limits) appears to be similar to that of its caregiver, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While experiential learning makes learning easier and more fun, the machine takes it one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but a tool to help people who are going through a new learning experience, such as starting a computer program or a new project.
Tutors can be virtual or real, or in other words, the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is a mentor.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, to be ready and to explain the challenging process to the student to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where there is no nurturing, care and education, but they grow up in such an environment.
We know that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The foster care should provide all the necessary items that are lacking in the previously taken house.
The Internet brings together both the collective and the interconnected.
The Internet's distinctive attributes, usage and solution approaches lead to further directions, such as these.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Aegme and McCord (1998) identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous engagement"" as new motivators when they examined audience response to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, which are subtle expressions that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by properly analyzing subtle gestures, one can tell if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", says that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess honesty.
They also suggested that such a capacity to interpret human behavior might exist in animals such as pets.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations create new genetic variations and selection separates them from the stock of known variations.
Isolation and recombination alternate back and forth between the two bridges with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult to meet the amino-acid requirements from plant sources available to those with digestive systems like humans.
Failure to do so can have serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition and eventual death.
The most readily available plant source is the protein in the leaves and beans, but for us humans, it's hard to digest unless it's cooked.
Meat, on the other hand, is not only easy to digest, but it is also a rich source of protein containing amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised to find that our ancestors were solving their 'protein problem' 'like the chimpanzees of the savannah today.'"
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and returning to sleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily without waking you completely by using a relatively quiet alarm clock.
If you want to reset your watch while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve taking a lot of fluids (mainly water or tea, known to increase urination) before bedtime, which causes a person to wake up to urinate.
The degree of conflict between the inner peace of a person and the stress level in his body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive life energy exists, and each person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve knowledge, but only our own stress and negativity stands in the way of achievement.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but it is infused with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, with Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to love.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy (self-awareness energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central concept of Tibetan meditation is Deva Yoga. Through the manifestation of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and self-knowledge is created.
The USSR and the USA became allies because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and by the end of the war they were separated because of differences in organization, tactics, and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought for real by proxy armies from Africa to Asia, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had broken down and now the only hope was to retreat and regroup near the fortifications of the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered Poland's eastern territories and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, as well as other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The traditional role of the Navy is to maintain the ability to transport people and goods in their country, while at the same time, interfering with the ability to transport people and goods of our enemy.
A recent example of this that we can note is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to move people and goods to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop the traffic, mainly by using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have conquered Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them as readily available for milk, hair, meat, and skin.
The goats are usually kept in herds, roaming the mountains or other pastures, often with young or adolescent children, and with a shepherd who knows little, and this form of animal husbandry is still used today.
In England, wagonways were built in the early 16th century.
Although the coaches' routes were made of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the use of horses to gain better speed and to pull heavier loads on the somewhat more congested roads of the time.
Crosses were introduced very early to keep tracks in place, however it was gradually realized that if the tracks had a layer of iron, they would be more efficient.
This became the standard method, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the box more rigid.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, all-iron wagons were introduced.
Walking was the first known form of transport, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, was not always a straight-legged walker.
The bipedal specialization Australopithecus has been found in fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus must have walked on two legs around 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more friendly way with nature, we can join the nature movement and we can also become activists to alleviate some of the suffering of future generations.
In many cases, it is the same as symptomatic treatment, but if we want to find a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and deal with it.
It is clear that the world has been greatly changed by the progress of mankind in science and technology and the problems have been compounded by the increase in population and the unruly lifestyle of mankind.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlop's printing shop a few blocks away.
"The whole night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, and it's now known as the 'Dunlap Broadside.'"
On July 8, John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document in the lobby of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who rescued it on 9 July by his troops in New York. A copy was delivered to London on 10 August.
The oldest extant copies of this document, 25 Dunlap Broadsides, are known to still exist; the original manuscript does not survive.
Many archaeologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of it as a dinosaur because it has wings and it can fly.
But there are still many things that look like dinosaurs that we find in birds.
They have legs that are spiny and have claws, and they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like T. Rex.
All computers in use today are based on the use of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, for use in computer terminology.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
An open can of medication or household toxic chemicals may be the best indication of internal intoxication.
Check the label for the specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used formally by entomologists to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient association with the larvae, which are highly dependent insects on humans.
Both killer bugs and beetles are shy, adapted to living in a nest or in the home of a host.
There are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the entire United States of America, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
Couples may decide that perhaps adoption is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
The couple may decide to plan an adoption for their baby.
In adoption, the birth parents of a child end their custody so that another couple can have custody of that child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
It is not discrete however, experimentation and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out the possibility of 1 or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and recording observations also provides direction to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical literature and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge spread, the West realized that it had been torn from its roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms we see in physiology and behavior are determined by the internal cycle and its production by the biological clock.
Not only do they respond to external periodic signals, but periodic cycles have been documented for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle for a period of time without external input.
One of the leading insights of the Hershey and Chase experiment was that DNA was genetic material.
Harshi and Chase used a phase, or virus, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, either labeling the DNA in the phase with a radioactive phosphorus or labeling the protein in the phase with a radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic component in which it occurs, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells or not.
In children, only new cells can be mutated, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who wish to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the natural scenery including flora and fauna.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information on ecosystems.
Visiting Borneo, taking photographs and learning about orangutans is one example.
Every morning, people leave their small hometowns to go to their workplaces and are passed by other people whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this shuttle of mobile transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supporting the transport system based on personal cars.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has altered the steady state of the ecosystem that has supported human evolution for the past 2 billion years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, we rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why does the transport system give such a boost to complaints, why does it fail every day? Are only transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental being planned?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior is relatively consistent, so there is a relatively consistent flow of traffic that can be expressed in simple mathematics.
To better represent the traffic flow, the following 3 key characteristics are related: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to go into the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of having their wings folded close to their bodies.
This gives it a wide range of small spaces to protect against predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies can't fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought otherwise; that the sun, along with other stars, revolved around the earth.
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be spinning, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some points, six miles wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the Earth to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects the waters of thousands of smaller rivers.
Pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the size of the Giza pyramids and the superior technical quality of their construction were not surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom focused on their ancestral monuments, which were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legal and official communications.
Italian is the language of everyday use, spoken by most of the working people of the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements of gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, because they are all found in their native form in nature and are very easy to mine using ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's much like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they must be transformed into new matter to produce what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of a specific type of matter, and all of the specific types of matter are made of microscopic particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that they can fit into a small space in the billions.
So, when the pencil came, it became a good friend of many people.
Unfortunately, as more and more new ways of writing emerged, the pencil's importance and use declined.
Now people write messages on computer screens, never having to use a sharpener.
One can also wonder how a new word will be typed on the keyboard.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy truck over a hill, and then splitting the nucleus back up, some of that energy is released.
Some nuclei are unstable, meaning they are likely to explode with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin in the area around Maria and thick in the upland areas.
Because the top layer of the hard material is thin, there may be more maria in the immediate area, making it easier for the lava to drain to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding out why people choose or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
This theory is about people who are doing things that they want to do and what things in their environment make them do things and what things don't make them do things.
The two popular theories of intent are the ascending chain of needs theory of the masses and the two-factor theory of Hertzberg.
"In general, when managers start managing their previous colleagues, two types of behaviour can emerge: people on one end of the spectrum try to be 'one of those boys' (or girls)".
This type of manager has a hard time making unpleasant decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the screen, an unknown person is transformed into someone who thinks he or she can change everything that he or she has done and make it their own.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often serves to create a gap between the hero and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are set to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual group members often act as a point of contact for the physical group near them.
They have more autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of the real invisible team (Larson and Lafosto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would you want to go through the process of setting up an institution when you are setting up a study?
Creativity and creativity can be seen when all available resources are used effectively in all operational departments of the organization.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome barriers can be a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and institutional study.
Agle (2006) reports that the organization uses the Continuum approach as a method to achieve this high level of performance.
The data from neurobiology provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive inquiry, thereby reducing the scope of the search and making it more accurate.
The relationship between the pathology of the brain and its behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and even alter certain mental functions.
New technologies are emerging that allow us to see and probe the structure and processes of the brain in ways we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our own mental processes.
Although AI is a science fiction behind it, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning and adaptation.
Research in AI involves building machines that automate actions that require intelligence.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnostics and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate branches, which focus on answering real life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in many fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Visiting places is a very big part of the classroom, and often a teacher has to take her students to places where there is no bus option.
Technology has provided solutions for virtual field trips, where students can see art in museums, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art from within their classrooms.
Virtual field trips are also a great way to discuss the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions of the website are put online like a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing, even though students often encounter spelling and grammar errors in blogs, the presence of an audience often makes a difference.
Now that students are the most critical critics, bloggers are struggling to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also ""makes students more aware of the world around them. "" The need to provide food to them according to the audience's preferences motivates children to be more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
"The proper use of blogs helps children to become more analytical and therapeutic; through active responses to literature on the Internet, students can determine their own position in relation to the writing of others and at the same time form their own views on specific issues (O'Raeveck, 2002)".
Ottawa is Canada's most attractive, bilingual capital, and home to many unique art exhibitions and museums that tell the past and present of Canada.
The South is home to Niagara Falls and the North is home to the uncharted beauty of Moscow and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as the best Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, the population is very sparse and some of it is part of the untouched forest.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
These East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and the most isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are allied with France, and are called luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to this land and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama lost the Cape route from Europe to India.
The department is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (not just one that looks very expensive, but any) can also be helpful.
Women need to understand that what they perceive as harassment may be due to cultural differences, and that chasing, holding hands, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to stand up for your role (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meranides as an architectural port of Anfa.
After an earthquake in 1755 the Portuguese destroyed it only to leave it empty and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou-i-Bada and the Spanish merchants who established their trading base there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine (North American stew), pottery, leather goods, hooks and numerous decorative objects treasures around the old Medina, but this is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which destroyed most of the city's roads, especially those in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting, which remains in North Kivu province.
The city is home to the base for climbing the Niagara volcano, as well as one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.
You can use a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
"Timbuktu, with its remoteness, is used as an example of a strange and distant place".
Today, Timbuktu is a city that has lost its prosperity, yet its reputation is a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of sand in the desert.
This was one of the key stops during the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
It is a city that is different from the rest of the country, because its people are more like Arabs than Africans.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANP Perks).
Like other South African national parks, the park is subject to daily conservation and entry fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a wild card which gives access to select parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong is named after the Hong Kong Islands, which are the main reason for many tourists to visit Hong Kong.
The appearance of the Hong Kong skyscrapers, exposed by the waters of Victoria Harbour, has been compared to a glittering bar chart.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go up against the falls.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the redeveloped land on the north shore.
This is the site that the British colonists claimed as their own, and so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest belt of seabed mangrove, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian mainland.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian part of the forest is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just salt marshes, but also the remnants of many of the forests that once covered the Ganges basin.
The area of Sundarbans is 3,850 km2 of which about one-third is covered by water.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 thistles in the area.
There are many buses leaving from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, however, the majority of buses going in the full direction and to Zakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are usually full, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, these are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable option to visit nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punaha (No. 200).
The Bridge over the Oiapoc River is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oiapoc River connecting the city of Oiapoc, Brazil, with Saint-Georges de la Oiapoc, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, this one is 378 metres high and has two alleys 3.50 metres wide.
The bridge has a clearance of 15 metres below the ground. The construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to end.
The Garanya were the most important indigenous group that now reside in eastern Paraguay, and were nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guayuri and the Piguay who survived by hunting, gathering food and fishing.
"The conflict between the Spanish conquerors and the local tribes in the 16th century gave birth to Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its indigenous people and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year is held in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Canitas.
Other times of the year, small competitions and matches can be seen here.
For news of competitions and tickets to polo matches, see Association Argentine de polo.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is pegged to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the FIC West store in Stanley to the only bank in the islands.
British pounds are usually accepted on the islands and Stanley credit cards are accepted everywhere, as well as United States dollars are often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted outside the islands, but British and US currency will be accepted; ask the owner in advance which payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the island, so please exchange the currency before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it has winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the tropics, where temperatures exceeding +30¬∞C are common in the summer months.
In winter, it will be deceptively cold: the temperature will rarely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity will make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no specific 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall is the same all year round".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to being seen by humans, wildlife is wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may appear, buffalo, elk, moose, bear, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep the proper distance. These animals are big, wild and dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, beware of the smell that attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying cooked, spicy food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is the site of the infamous naval incident of 1889 when seven ships of Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave their harbours.
All but one British cruiser sank, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
A peaceful assembly in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mao movement culminated in the assassination of the supreme leader, Tapua Tamasese Lilovi III.
Since Auckland is in two ports, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The northern shores (in the North Harbour district) are of the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All of them are sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by the pohu-tukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helier in central Auckland.
It is a sometimes crowded family beach and has a good chain of shops along the beach.
"The main local beer is 'number 1' not a blended beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one. Other local beers are called ""manta""".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better at reaching far.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you have any doubts about safety, it's also easy to find bottled water.
The concept of flat white coffee is foreign to Australians. The small black drink is espresso, a cappuccino served with cream (not whipped) and tea served without milk.
The hot chocolate is by Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many visits to the hip throughout the year, and injuries to the hip due to any of these causes are rare.
However, take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety cues.
Box jellyfish are seen north of 1770 between October and April along the coast or in the river channel, and are occasionally seen in the bay during this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and stay away from the water.
Freshwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being the northern tributaries from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travellers peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep after they reach their destination.
Although travel agents often deal with specific hotels, it is also possible to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through travel agents.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation from the airport and combined packages of airline and hotel.
If you need time to think about the offer or you need to get some other paperwork (e.g. a visa), they can also reserve a reservation.
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, large numbers of concertgoers camp out in the same area, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to see the action in action, you have to come quickly and pitch your tent to the music.
Please note that even if the music on the main stage has ended, music may continue to play until late at night in some parts of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as it can be a terrible nuisance for those who are severely affected by traveling through the snow.
In St. Petersburg cruises are allowed to spend time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempted from requiring a visa (see note).
Casinos often do a lot to make guests spend more of their time and money. Windows and clocks are often missing and it is very difficult to find a way out.
To keep the guests in good mood and to keep them in the mood, they usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offerings.
Some venues/places provide alcoholic beverages in the home. However, alcohol consumption affects judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Those who drive on high roads or mountain roads should be aware of the possibility of temperatures below freezing, snow, or ice.
The snow and ice-covered roads have less friction and you cannot drive like on asphalt roads.
During a blizzard, you can get enough snow to bury you in a very short time.
Snow falling on vehicle windows or snow drift or condensation may also hinder visibility.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are common in many countries and traffic flows smoothly all year round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest boost to tourism in Africa and is a major attraction for many visitors.
The term Overland Travel addresses safari, a popular use for seeing the fascinating African wildlife, especially on savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, can get close to cars, and with the help of standard equipment, you can get a good look at them.
Lions, leopards and scorpions are sometimes hidden, and you can see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a "hillwalking", "hiking safari", or "walking") involves a few hours or several days of hiking".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host 2 Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the suspension, you are in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but now the coronavirus-based cancellation policies for the end of March, when the Olympics are scheduled, have not been extended beyond July 2020.
It is expected that the tickets for many events will be between ¬•2,500 and ¬•1,30,000, with the average ticket price at ¬•7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Irons and ironing boards are available for rent in many hotels, even when there is no one person in the room.
If irons are not available or you are not comfortable using irons, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the cloth (otherwise it will burn, or worse, burn).
There are different options for water purification, some options are more effective on specific microbes.
In some places, a minute of boiling water may be sufficient, while in other places, several minutes may be required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Passengers may see insects that are not found in their neighborhoods.
The insect can spoil food, cause inflammation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually recognized as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from tax and excise duty at a specific place.
For countries with high taxation, travelers can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont creates challenging conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which frequently passes through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, explain yourself: high grade, narrow alleys, and steep cobblestone roads.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those set in the previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 metres per hour (56-64 km/h) - and it is more important than other times to adhere to them strictly.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much more robust than other parts of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are very good and like their southern neighbours in Austria, Bavaria is rich and varied.
Since apples are available all year round, its fruit pastries are common, as well as cherries and plums in pastries are seen in summer.
Many baked goods in Germany also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are especially well enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but good quality pastries, try a dish called berliner, funkuhn or kraffan, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
"The stomach can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of fluid present".
In India and Pakistan, the northern regions use dahi; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, the cuisine known as Indonesian cuisine includes a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if more qualified slang is used, the term originally means this central and eastern food of the main island of Java.
Many seasonal dishes are now available throughout the archipelago, including Javanese cuisine, which includes nuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The struts that hang on either side of the saddle are designed to support the rider's foot.
It provides more stability for the rider but it may be a safety concern due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in it.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he will be thrown if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, many safety precautions have been taken.
At first, many riders wear riding boots with flat, mostly narrow soles and high heels.
Further, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stiff leather to fall under the saddle when the rider slides backwards.
Kokamo Valley - a major climbing area in Chile where there are distinct walls and poles of granite that are known as the Yosemite of South America.
The summits include breathtaking views from the peaks, and climbers from all over the world continue to successfully explore new routes in this vast terrain.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, include the popular sport of sliding downwards on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
