Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totalling 29 percent
After the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria brought a noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People ’ s Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the previous chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously at risk.
In contrast, the leader of the Coalition for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP scored even worse, losing almost nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and particularly of the People's Party, which called for early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People ’ s Party still had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But voters probably punished the party for failing to govern.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party ’ s executive board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent of the votes for the time being, and the BZÖ eleven percent - the Social Democrats simultaneously expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had reached agreements with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) regarding a common government, which had even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is prepared to cooperate with any party, is obviously counting on this development and assumes a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but suffered slight losses and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four per cent barrier and has therefore not entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of unlawfully collecting beetles, then, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be a certain cooling down of the Czech and Indian relations.
The Minister stressed this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clarified, then certainly, then there will be a certain cooling down," he said after a meeting that took place at the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government wanted the local government in Dardjiling, whose jurisdiction covered the matter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could ask for release on bail and await his sentence in freedom, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same statement during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be possible for him," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide 'competent legal assistance' to those convicted, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help was already being offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a strong interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians admit it too, "Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed to his partner, the Czech press agency ČTK, that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I have already been promised quite a lot," he simply stated.
A Czech judges the struggle for the seabed
It approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small dot, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself ", said the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Rights of the Sea.
Its head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds to it.
Here reign working spirit and enthusiasm.
The seabed hitherto contains a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also hitherto unknown living organisms, which for example hold the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The coastal states today vehemently declared their entitlement to the new maritime areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its soles that is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the boundaries of the sea, often the boundary of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, "Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be substantiated by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the last three countries have been successful, "adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to be able to significantly enlarge its maritime areas, recently met with an international response.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the seabed expansion granted by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for ten years from the moment they ratify the 'Montego Bay Agreement'.
Where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
No state has a special status here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a gold-digger's land," says director Mikulka with a little exaggeration, adding that "its individual areas are clearly defined in law and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, as a result of the Convention, it was granted the status of a so-called "pioneering investor", as were investors from a few other countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the zone ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is structured there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"You can support there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "says another jurist, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion with him as a model.
It reminds of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary Shem who, according to legend, brought the Golem to life.
German special forces were on site at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the solution of the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not deployed.
The circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming more and more known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists from the Bundeswehr and officials from the GSG 9, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief were at the site of liberation.
As speakers of the ministries on Monday evening further communicated, however, the German forces were not needed, because the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and fled, when they recognized indications of a violent release.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to involve it as a local support force.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions on 19 September in southern Egypt.
Following the abduction in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been taken to and fro in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear to the end as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress narrowly failed to deliver a $700 billion bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones roared into the depths.
The US House of Representatives rejected the government ’ s bailout of the financial markets by 206 votes to 227.
Despite appeals from US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority in favor of the program to contain financial chaos.
In a dramatic move, supporters had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the MPs to vote in favour, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones collapsed by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Investors worried that the government bailout package might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, only to crash again after the failure was announced.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Organizers register rising reservation numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover of travel bookings for the coming months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, a study shows that Germans ’ appetite for travel remains undimmed.
As reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin, the travel agencies recorded an increase in turnover of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year.
According to an investigation by the market research institute GfK, bookings for the autumn months have already risen.
Thus the turnover plus of the travel agencies for October amounted to approximately eleven per cent in the comparison to 2007, communicated the DRV.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, trips to the USA are particularly in demand, said the DRV.
Here the booking increase would amount to approximately a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic regions are particularly sought after by the Germans.
Package travel is particularly popular, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the costs are "easier for customers to calculate than for individually organised holidays".
Consumers could save money through early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that compared to the previous year there would again be an increase in turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann ’ s Apres ’ Ski ’ s ’ hits in the endless loop, beer from litres ’ jugs and celebrities in Designer ’ s Dirndln.
A Oktoberfest debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blond, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl dress.
I have dark hair, am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Hardly three minutes on the Oktoberfest, the photographers already pounce on us and take a full picture of the memory cards - very flattering and that on my first visit to the Oktoberfest.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap "Dirndl" seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Oktoberfest Touri and actually located north of the Weisswurst equator, kept the well-being in the costume to date still within limits.
But once arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears a dirndl or lederhosen; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reaps my dirndl apron.
A lady from Munich draws my attention to the fact that I had tied up the apron wrongly: "Links hoast frei, Mitte Jungfrau, rechts vergeben, hinten verwitwet."
Secretly I edit the loop from the back to the left.
"Fit," said he, laughing.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear plain felt hats, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretches out the naked backside unasked.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooooo".
He tells me this after getting rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wild biesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening paramedics run in droves over the fairground, who have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at once drag a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works as with most Oktoberfest visitors: Empty, fully back.
Who is in the promille, coffin under the tarp, you do not see.
"That's what they do, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared into the fray.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in downtown.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
In the meantime he was released on bail.
Turkey broadens diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey aspired to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey ’ s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that is what the guides tell you.
The building sits astride the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front, looking like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building decays about
But once inside the curved ticket office, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project whose westernmost access was this.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a late bloc in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by train to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is Saudi Arabia today.
But Germany ’ s imperialist ambitions faltered during World War I.
Its railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces pulled out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In the year 1917 an ammunition train flew into the air, whereby the artful roof was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly disintegrated, largely ignored by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it, to highlight the expansion of Turkey ’ s diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighboring regions generated by the Cold War borders has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the fundamentals of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP ’ s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the equal-step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city for the new secular state project of turning my back on the Ottoman past.
But the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused some mistrust in the West, particularly in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a purpose-built, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception, "he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays it has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
It would have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to make up its mind?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here spoke to almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that, figuratively speaking, Europe as a whole can travel east on those very railway tracks towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpashas station, after another sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe ’ s ambitions in the Middle East are now, to a large extent, in Turkey ’ s hands.
And as I waited at the pier for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called 'the sick man of Europe' in those days.
At that time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (obituary September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already in their late twenties - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the readiness and ability of the choir to tackle every piece of music that was presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and persisted only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which continued for years.
How often did Tod urge us to "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say: "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings! "
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never overbearing but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years or so, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by a single one - often inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He loathed conductors who, according to his words, simply "went peddling one or two well-known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) you write that "in 1946 he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research fellowship... while at the same time studying for a BSc, MA and doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was born in 1951 in the United States on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments. '
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-capacity saloon offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are the technical subtleties that make driving even more comfortable and save fuel.
Changes before the coming revolution.
Such is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new Jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before analyzing the new model, one must say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to initial observations, Honda managed to replace this model for a shorter period of time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon that affects its sale in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless Honda tries to increase the sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company in 2007 sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the assumed growth on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the drop in sales in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to conclude the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 fewer cars than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 metres in length, which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to market estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder are sold in the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight is scheduled to appear on the market in the first few months of the year, and its public presentation will be held for the first time in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It should be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 liter gasoline engine, because the capacity of the boot of Honda Jazz with a 1.2 liter gasoline engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, whereas the first jazz was only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1,2 and 1,4 liters.
Both variants have the VTEC, system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides torque-strong performance for the entire engine runtime.
The first 1.2 litre variant produces 90 bhp at 6,000 rpm and maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which in the previous generation reached 83 hp, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp 1.4 model has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'car 'bee' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, more precisely by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a biomimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Technical Development Center of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of technology at PR and R & D, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee ’ s compound eyes, which can be seen at an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
In order to simulate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He detects obstacles up to two meters away from the BR23C and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor onboard, which is immediately translated into a signal to avoid collision.
'The moment an obstacle is detected, the little robot will imitate the flight of the bees and will immediately change direction by turning its wheels by 90 ° or more to avoid the collision.
The main difference from any other system is that this evasive manoeuvre is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not so, the robot would not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory of Mobility and the chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither move up nor down, nor cross over; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that enables it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to prevent the small robot from collisions.
'This device only needs a few seconds each to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require to store neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This sounds surprising, but it ’ s not about the GBs, nor even the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in the production cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium and polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium and ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, to guide when driving to the destination, while avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She is trembling before being mortgaged.
It must be understood that the US Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and in order to prevent US citizens from becoming involved in mortgages, stories of supposedly solvent banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of the bad credits' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And above all, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a page for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game expands?
Well, when a dreamlike room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it is not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley to provide capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its business, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion, acquiring 21% of its capital, an innovation stemming from a sharp fall in its stock price.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley ’ s common shares at a single price of $25.25, for a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said that global business will be based on a single average price of $29, 28% above the current price.
Morgan Stanley ’ s stock, however, dropped by 6.79% to $23.07 against 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to holding bank status," said John Mack, CEO of the US group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which should allow him to expand his business into new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street ’ s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
'A week ago, 'explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo,' we thought that the investment would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and protect ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below the price of Morgan Stanley shares.
And the deal will proceed with a reduction in earnings of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged within a given period at more than 50% above the value of the sale, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to capitalize on investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
A press spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG ’ s investment, Morgan Stanley should have a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had 'significantly' reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its stock price fall by half as the price of insolvency insurance soared.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only 'survivor' of Wall Street's major investment banks following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Rebuild the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
It was the third person, following the example of his like-minded friends, who put the plan for a new constitution to the vote this Sunday.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results, which amount to 80% of the votes, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a census by a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for the 'yes' vote, predicting between 63% and 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he said in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorial Guards.
Of course Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to safeguard the 'new socialism' advocated by the President.
The Constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'plan for development' in a country that lives largely from oil extraction by foreign companies and from the foreign currency that emigrants send into the country.
The project, promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also confers greater power on the Head of State, who will be able to exercise up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also safeguards the principle of free health care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also proposes to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorial base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who were captured ten days ago.
You are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon safe and sound.
In the morning they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived on board a special plane at the military base Al Maza next to the international airport of Cairo around 3.30 pm.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a quarter of foreigners in Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and the kidnappers' were not paid a ransom ', Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna explained on the tarmac.
After being captured by a 4WD safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya on 19 September, the group of hostages was repeatedly transported from one hideout to the next by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It concerns eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian woman - and besides eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
'Shots were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled, 'said the person in charge, who wants to remain anonymous.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, receiving support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is, on the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence and special forces, 'he explained without further detail.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The previous day, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a patrol vehicle carrying the kidnappers, killing six of them, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that it was in contact with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan ’ Unité (SLA ’ U) movement, which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
So much the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the wretched sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are dying of hunger?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no real laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government is making EUR 3.5 million available solely for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
For our American neighbours, it is written in their country's constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, and by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, work intensively on history, save the numerous private archives with a few pennies, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the strength of despair when patrons and decision-makers release their bulldozers onto our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux, Governments Nationalize Sections of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian Fortis Bank, which has been in turmoil due to the US financial crisis: The three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the bank and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
At the weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Commissioner of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions now taken in relation to the bank could set a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries are buying around 49 percent of the Bank ’ s shares.
The bank is expected to sell part of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities acquired by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis last week started a steep decline, in the second half of the week already serious crisis scenarios appeared.
But analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big to fail.
The institution ’ s securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the market value of the Group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion US rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are to blame for the decline in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the Bank ’ s new Director General.
The financial institution was also on the search for a private buyer, but it found itself however no prospective customer with a material offer.
The Belgian government, however, sought reassurance - no investor should tremble for his money, it was said.
So far, there has been no panic among customers, and the bank ’ s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also owns leasing companies.
Fox in the Chicken House
Because of a person ’ s drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market may become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of medicinal product data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox with the chickens "- quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the tracking of prescription data.
Insurance companies fix the fees and the payout amounts in case of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and if the risk is estimated too high, the insurance is not taken out at all.
Previously, the customer was sent for a medical examination and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more cost-effective method: he uses the customer ’ s identification number to obtain the data from pharmacies over the past year and a half, i.e. which products were purchased, and the program uses this to calculate what kind of illness the customer is suffering from and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large quantities of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatably high, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for different purposes, such as for migraine and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is, from the perspective of insurers, a high-risk factor, while the previous ones did not.
For the consultation and processing of the data, own companies have been formed, which, before they refer the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do this by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratories and combine them with data on drug use to provide an even more accurate picture of patients ’ health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and it is becoming more difficult to control their use.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his program further, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, as the insurance companies would otherwise not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to the mercy of the fox.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are each other ’ s leading trade partners, this was the main topic at the ninth summit, among other global problems.
Today, the French-speaking Indian summit is also taking place, where cooperation in the nuclear energy sector is the main topic of discussion.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a rising democratic superpower that should be given more votes and voice in international affairs, member states have so far failed to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi ’ s permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade in the next five years, i.e. to a good 100 billion euros.
Given that trade rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not at all ambitious.
With this in mind, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India have been legally merged into one, so that air traffic will also be boosted in the future.
By 2009, India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India ’ s number one partner, New Delhi ranks only ninth among the EU ’ s partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
These included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which is to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as with the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the coming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will hold a bilateral meeting to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Meanwhile, Paris is hoping to win contracts worth EUR 20 billion from French companies for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair is expecting over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and introduce over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Maria Giro, will represent the Italian Government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be represented in the 264 square meter exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in Exhibition Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is declining in the entire adult and youth sector, in particular.
Billionaire Steve Fossett ’ s small plane disappeared a year ago
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on 3 September 2007, was found.
The parts were found on a high plateau of 3000 m height, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully rebutted the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, and a troop has been sent out. Now, we have the certainty that this is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Office of Traffic Safety (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after the sighting of the aircraft, a team was sent out to identify the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on 3 September 2007, after Fossett had taken off from Yerington in Nevada for a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett ’ s personal belongings were finally found by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two passports with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long run of records.
In 2002, in his sixth attempt, he was the first person to circle the globe in a hot-air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single non-stop flight.
Among his many records is also a high altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes, this, however, with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don't expect
A Suv that, thanks to its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles, is out of the ordinary.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this off-roader.
Precisely because of its extraordinary characteristics, the Suv Glk ’ s presentation will also be unconventional, and will be on display in Mercedes ’ s showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new guise, namely in the form of a 3D advertising campaign - this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum expenditure, which is to be accomplished in different phases, which will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in the form of 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como, giving the whole thing a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
Indeed, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
The new Glk is then illuminated in all its details in different moments with the help of Elumina8 and then put together as a whole again.
Undoubtedly it is the concern of Mercedes to introduce with this advertisement a new kind of the car advertisement into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in arousing the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from Triveneto - now they risk banning the stadium
Who are these 150 or so 200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
There have never been any clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The sponsors are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia joined them in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: but these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing extremist fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, 144 cards for the game had been made available to the Italian fans: all were issued in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia, no one was under stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already charged in this respect, were denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case the Tifosi arrested or identified in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitators who might follow little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that in no case give such a behavior the possibility of justification" so it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on especially looking at the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports inspectorate) will gather, and on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce" Duce calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime... "
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy), who for a few weeks has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the Chief of Police of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now hails from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but there is no doubt that the behaviour of these 150 and 200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds Osservatorio No. 1 - crimes are punished in the country of their deed.
So far, this group has held back, but now we need to think about what has happened and what will happen.
But let us also talk about the whistles during Mameli's hymn: this too is not a crime, but allow me, there is no education "....
