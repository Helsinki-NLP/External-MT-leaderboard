European inflation slipped in food
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the rapid rise in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in all 13 euro area countries, with annual inflation of 3.1% after October's 2.6%, the Luxembourg-based Union Statistical Office announced.
Official forecasts gave only a 3 percent chance - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, UK and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest rate on the pretext that the decline, together with rising commodity prices and reduced forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene in this issue later.
Inflation in Germany, at 3.3 percent, broke a 12-year record, while in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area soared as a result of soaring food and energy prices.
The price of wheat rose by 88% and the price of soybeans reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market has risen this year by 52 percent, reaching last month's black gold price of almost $100 a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will have already fallen to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months at around 3 percent, however the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December support for the Young Democrats' Alliance had risen significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup had never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - for the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the confident voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the voters of the opposition - would mean support of more than two thirds (71%) versus support of one fifth for the Socialists (20%).
The poll shows that the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the threshold necessary to have any parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even from the previous low - it has never been higher, with 41 percent of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 percent thought the situation was quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in their own economic situation.
As for next year, most people expect the situation to deteriorate and only one tenth expect an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of respondents, more than in any previous Gallup poll, felt that the Prime Minister was performing his duties more poorly than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or have a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54% of the population have no confidence in the Head of Government and 27% in the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the political situation is how much of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question on participation said they would certainly participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the European Social Fund and the European Social Fund.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of paying tuition fees, 79 percent of paying for medical consultations, and 84 percent of paying for hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of education rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is Auchan, Tesco has increased its prices fivefold
The average price level of 16 per cent was maintained by the hypermarkets in the Budaörs gold trading triangle, with the difference that no VAT increase was made this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also the average Napi newspaper Christmas basket in the gold trading triangle of Budaörs rose by 16 percent, but all hypermarkets saw growth well above HUF 1,000.
As in December last year, food prices in supermarkets had already "shot up", so there was no dramatic percentage increase in price compared to the high starting point.
But it is obviously frightening to consumers that what they could buy last year for well under HUF 9,000 today they cannot buy for even 10,000.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of HUF 10,000 by a minimum of HUF 91.
And the highest-value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 the basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum and fish remained almost at the same level as last year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillets, walnuts and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilo of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the two-liter Coke with a redeemable bottle was less than HUF 200, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only HUF 257.
However, in Napi's basket Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15%, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18% the prices listed in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was HUF 1480.
Last year the average price increase was 1206 HUF, so that during last year's Christmas the VAT increase was felt in prices.
It was this process which destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied to each product and to calculate the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of a product's circulation poorly, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that is adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The price increase of Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the VAT increase that the most expensive one was HUF 1720 higher than the value recorded in 2006, while the cheapest one was only HUF 844.
This year there were no such extremes, as the highest price now was HUF 1630 more than last year and the cheapest also increased by HUF 1284.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase in less than 20 months, with supermarkets seeing consumer goods prices rise more than 30 percent.
(This does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics, however: in the case of some basic foods, this office recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month period.
So for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because the price of this product, which was quite expensive last year compared to the base, recorded, in the worst case, a mere 10 percent increase in prices.
By all indices, flour suppliers are stronger than egg suppliers and can impose the drastic price increase even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets don't complain about the golden trade triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
In our experience, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy large quantities of all products, carrying the preserved food on pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large lines formed in front of the boxes in all three stores because of the sudden increase in the number of customers.
However, we have information that in the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of household appliances.
In many hospitals, you save money on disinfectants.
This year, several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, mainly due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions prevailing in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the head of the department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals, even disinfectants are saved.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
A man hospitalized after a serious accident was found to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred at this same hospital earlier this year.
A serious car accident victim was discharged from hospital and the same patient was soon to be returned to hospital as a result of MRSA and since then no major surgery has been performed because of the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multiresistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, medical chief of the National Center of Epidemiology.
This means that hospitals have certainly recorded this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents, the rest are not known.
Nearly two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, or methicillin-oxycillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once over- or under-applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics turn into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and spread quickly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example wound infections or sepsis, primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened bodies, in the elderly or in people of low weight.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are common in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff attend to them in rubber gloves and mask and there are adequate antibiotics for their treatment", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are screened for MRSA in advance, but even this cannot prevent infection in all cases.
It's not in style to take samples.
It would be possible to prevent hospital MRSA infections in most cases, but the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of the formation and transmission of multi-resistant pathogens", says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should screen hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who have MRSA in their system.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when the MRSA infections are already visible in the patient", said the epidemiological center's chief medical officer.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for treating infections and pathological conditions.
The aim is to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that is to say, that microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in outpatients or in basic care", said Karolina Böröcz.
It saves on disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare workers.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
MRSA is transmitted by drop-in transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital wards are often crowded, beds often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation, disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
Karolina Böröcz believes that where appropriate prevention measures are taken, fewer such infections occur or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is being fought in every country.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The programme appears to be successful, with MRSA infections showing a decreasing trend in England, according to the data provided.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-drug resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative on the alcohol control for the police commander who caused a fatal accident .
The official expert report on the fatal accident caused by the commander of the police of the XXII district has been made.
It is possible that the then-dismissed commander of the police of the XXII district was driving drunk or in a daze, who on Tuesday hit and killed a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the General Prosecutor's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control which had already found that the former police commander had not consumed any alcoholic beverage before getting behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle at the bend of Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(The latter fact, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when turning.)
The passerby died after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is being handled by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
€400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit agreements totalling EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a budget of EUR 300 million in 2006 to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, to be carried out with a grant from the Cohesion Funds, of which the parties had previously signed a loan agreement worth EUR 100 million. The contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement is also intended to finance the budget for education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary. The decision on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be taken later when the loan agreement is extended.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the University of Debrecen's innovation and research project.
The talks also covered the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalised the details of the Metro financing with the EU, they would revisit the issue of whether or not the original contract needed to be modified and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could take place as early as the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is based on the Euribor and the EIB offers an eight-year grace period, without any commission for keeping the loan available to the borrower.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed to the aforementioned Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying on the EU's even cheaper market, which will get expensive quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach villas.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max's analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also attract real estate developers' interest and more and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap Rus area.
The capital Sofia will also be attractive, as commercial and office space promises a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of Europe's most attractive golfing paradises, and can thus be a major destination during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already shopping, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy property in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot developers are also present and there are traditionally many Russian clients on the Black Sea beaches and in ski resorts.
Foreign customers can be divided into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional manager of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and they value the proximity of a large city, shops, and usually a local doctor.
The second category is comprised of villa buyers (Bulgaria was in December among the top 10 holiday destinations for Germans).
The third group is comprised of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of profiting in the medium to long term.
The price of capital properties is constantly rising, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, over the last five years they have increased by 21 per cent a year
The increase in the price of real estate considerably outstrips the growth in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hidrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the level of experts will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and policy makers from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap for post-Kyoto emissions reduction efforts through 2012.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate precise figures at the moment, although it is likely to agree to a 25 to 40 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries are willing to offer material and technological aid to countries in need, in addition to reducing emissions.
The Council also agreed on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member steering committee, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from 1990 levels, regardless of whether the 'post-2012 agreement' is signed or not, and is ready to commit to a reduction of even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a 5.2 per cent reduction, of which the then 15 EU Member States committed to an 8 per cent reduction.
Hungary has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period 1985-87, which the country will meet, says the press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot at stake in Bali, as the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed within two years, because otherwise, its entry into force will surely be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol, would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reduction, the need for which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN's international scientific association that deals with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and would not prevent an increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C, which scientists say would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to take advantage of YouTube services: Special forces deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban - BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled at the general operations corps in Kandahar, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
Already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers have been uploaded to the Internet and their "channel" has been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true purpose of the British Army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, it inevitably carries some political message, since it specifically justifies the rationale for military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, the distributor also features amateur videos, for example about the deaths of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers talk at most of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos of actual operations have been uploaded to the Internet, but the British Army is only recently seizing this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different way of recruiting with the free-to-download shooters called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers.
Tombouille and salty pie at the Christmas party of the ministries
It does not seem sentimental to the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a work meeting for her colleagues who will be able to bid farewell to the year 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power is enjoyed.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for the Ministry's employees.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, and on the Christmas of the Missionaries, the relatives of soldiers currently serving overseas will be invited.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a lavish holiday in relation to the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of HUF 4 320 000 and about 350 of the ministry's 600 employees are expected to attend.
The party will be a Christmas party, with artists performing and a raffle.
The ANF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was celebrated on Wednesday at the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with music concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost HUF one million, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party being held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Community-funded Economic Development.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA as we have not been able to contact the person responsible.
You can attend without a suit.
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia's day on December 7.
Their CNAJ didn't charge anything for using their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
In answer to [origo's] question they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, labour and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organise a programme and a party for its employees in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth, on the other hand, is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a year-end work meeting.
The attendance of 180 guests is expected to be limited to coffee and salty cakes, the press office said, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of HUF 2500 per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres became minister, the workers of the MF celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
The official nature of the event will be determined not only by the ministerial speech but also by the time of the evening.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialised diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short greeting from the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas celebrations - this is what the relevant press departments told [origo].
The press department of the environment portfolio could not report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that more than four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The giant strike is gathering forces.
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while a work stoppage will begin on Monday - the day of the final vote on the public health law.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since railway traffic will be completely stopped and the workers of the Budapest Public Transport Company will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League unions will report on the details of their Monday strike held jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Machinists' Union will also be formed to coordinate the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not inform about the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for a strike.
If the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the agenda of Monday's National Assembly it is also possible that the public health law will only be voted on in the late hours of the night, or perhaps near midnight.
The strike on Monday will cause significant difficulties in transport: railways will be closed indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport may be stopped in the morning and more than half of Volan's intercity bus services may be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite time, others for a definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railways and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are traveling in trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours will be on strike the workers of the Empresa de Transporte Colectivo de Budapest, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Unions of the Electric Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educators' Unions called a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will go on a nationwide strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that the new pension calculation system, which will come into force next year, be introduced gradually.
The third is to ensure that, even before 2010, the occupations which deserve early retirement are able to enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and is waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was set up in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has in various ways increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
The company's 'risk warning' states: 'The biggest political risk in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity is the fact that 'with the worsening of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may occur even in the short term'.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably to provoke an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They claimed that this was due to one of the main faults of the Hungarian political actors: 'the public actors gave the public debate on the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could base their political strategy on the existing differences between Roma and Hungarians'.
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts breaking out - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country".
We are reminded that: from autumn 2006 onwards, the reorganisation of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and impetus and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organisations have been established in the country which call themselves 'national self-defence associations'.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the State" - they add.
They claimed: all this is done in accordance with the method which attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on society's discontent with politics and political parties.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the legal framework for the registration of associations is not changed.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring states the Hungarian Guard was referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighbouring countries, want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this has an influence on the political stability of the region", they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The establishment of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the massive Roma riots that occurred in one of the Sofia neighborhoods (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the State remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: 'This initiative has sparked lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that certain Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they will form their own guard to resist.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary will also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - you can read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, the director of research at Political Capital, said: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party isn't always written in red numbers.
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days which are written in red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - which will be fewer next year - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, holidays are not uniform.
Hungarian law makes a distinction between national holidays, state holidays and public holidays.
The holidays are mainly related to religious and historical holidays.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are holidays - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written in red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and on 23 October, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May the Labor Day, on 1 and 2 November we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas are two-day festivals in our country.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so often a bridge is made when before or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends, you cannot miss work or school on the Saturdays before.
The Minister of Labour makes a specific decree on when work must be done in exchange for the day immediately preceding or following the holiday.
This legal provision is binding on all employers and their employees, as well as on employees and public officials.
It is not compulsory for companies and service institutions which, because of their function, work continuously even during public holidays.
This year the work order will be altered only around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December onwards, life in the country will almost stop, as according to experience, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year, many of our holidays will fall on a midweek or weekend, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be changed around Labor Day so that workers can rest for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, you will have to work instead of Friday 24.
The next year, however, the holiday will be a rest day, since from 24 December onwards almost no work will be done, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little dissuasive measures to make your colleagues' lives miserable.
E-mails we forget to send, voicemails we never get, innocent lies that pass us by without us even realizing it: all of these are part of our "everyday workplace folklore".
You have to decide whether you will accommodate minor annoyances or consciously avoid confusing situations that may irritate others.
I'll give you some advice.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been contacted by the marketing department", says one of your colleagues".
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best, he feels sorry and tries to fix the problem, perhaps calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, the issue is resolved with an apology.
Before proceeding with embarrassing explanations, it is worthwhile to meditate on the things you can do to make your colleagues' lives bitter and to make a conscious effort to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to grab a document, an office supply or your phone and you can't find them.
Do you remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it was gone?
Did you find your pen lost on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll be rightly angry with you for stealing their stuff.
Don't pick up envelopes or post-its from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they sell out before their time.
You gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There's no good solution to stop rumors that are already circulating.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (guesses) you have about your colleagues' private lives!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Keep what you have heard to yourself, and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others know his things.
You're taking sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office and say you are sick and have excruciating headaches, you feel sick or otherwise, you feel that you would rather rest that day; think that others should do your work, your unreserved tasks, your work by the deadline.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that you will not be at work the next day or that something may happen to you, and you must stay at home, let them know so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Barking, laughing, phone calls
Are you busy with your work, but suddenly your colleagues laugh at you?
Have you ever unintentionally overheard a phone conversation that you should have just ignored?
Don't bother your colleagues with your humming, singing, loud conversations (less when you're doing them over their head), kicking, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if you are not currently delving into a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you didn't finish something on time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
You don't mention the chaos that may eventually reign in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must acknowledge if you have made a mistake that hurts others and you must make amends!
Ask how you can make up for your mistake!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and sneakers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don't wear a comfortable jogging suit even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be disorganized, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the public's expectations.
The car is moving slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
There's a strange beat on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'll turn it up.
The rhythm of the music changes and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir like a real gem intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks totally different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although garage rock style is fashionable again, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the ensemble of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to triumph, when he was asked for film soundtracks (pl.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of Article 93 (2) of the Treaty.
The wider public became aware of the ensemble which at first performed only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected their first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national records, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, capable of selling itself also in the Western markets.
There's no doubt that Zagar and his outfit are in style, but no one has asked them whether or not they're happy to wear this label.
The band reacted as they should: they prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the airy, the flying is fine, but in addition to the airy of the music, now there appeared - in keeping with the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the rock and roll effect.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real hit of the mr2 Petõfi channel which lately broadcasts from morning to night popular music.
Well, everything is in order.
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer about this.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: to what extent is the one you are performing a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of a select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two kinds of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called alternative underground music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally just for sale, making it commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B.Zs: Overseas, especially in the West, light music has larger traditions.
There, not only the 15 and 20 year olds attend concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are happening around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they're from and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we've never written music for the market.
We don't compose music for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you try to live up to the public's expectations, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather west of us.
B.Zs: We don't follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music to his.
We're more of a team, trusting each other's musical presence and letting it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our careers in their group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: In the mr2 hit list Petõfi Wings of Love is at the top.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
ZsB: We didn't intend to write big hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the record, trying to relax after the sonic orgy of the record and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good-voiced soloists from our own national music scene.
This was the creation of the six-woman choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later renamed the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you write the song exactly like that or did the girls change things?
ZsB: This song existed a long time ago in an instrumental version and when we had all the material for the album, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came about virtually on the first try and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems like the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's brief solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and no louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their songs.
They're also in the background on stage.
Did you do it on purpose?
B.Zs: They're at the bottom simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously didn't want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about that, about forgetting for a while our ego, who came from where and where is going, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have liked to have made others feel the same euphoric mood we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you work on the most?
ZsB: In the composition of music, actually none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing a concert piano or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, little by little, everything fell into place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
ZsB: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already released the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal thief.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Commercial Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, certainly, with good capabilities.
He sensed a long time ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character", was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's answers, as seen in the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that he was a man who at the end of last year made a profit of over 1.6 billion euros from his business.
Crisis not just in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank", he says in his answers.
In the summer, during the American crisis, he managed to win 500 million euros.
She saw this opportunity coming earlier this year.
In February, we started hearing some news about so-called subprime mortgages being offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis was not to affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe him and he bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him", Kerviel confesses, adding that he has left nothing for himself, at all.
During the entire interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even went so far as to deceive the bosses, even as the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk turned into the gain
Were you afraid you'd be discovered?
I'm not sure.
"I thought I had made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy".
Where did you get the willpower to take such a risk?
In my position, it was a gradual process.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
Annual salary was handled between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I'd never make as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that people were watching me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress", Kerviel described to the researchers.
But soon after I joined the company, my first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he won, during the London bombings, a 500 million euro title by playing it down.
And this was a kick-start mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you go.
"This is like a snowball", the police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew all this or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they would close their eyes".
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to wipe out all traces.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did you locate him?
He became a suspect after his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to look at his file", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the potential to get 365 billion
The Czech Government ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
The seven operational programmes will provide approximately SEK 125 billion for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to benefit from around SEK 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the Fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure, which will amount to 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and enterprises to raise resources in business innovation.
Companies should be able to obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
In terms of the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newcomers that use them least.
Twenty years for Nicaragua's former president, court decrees
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua on Thursday decreed a 20-year sentence for former president Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 billion (nearly $1.8 billion).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go under house arrest at his hacienda not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP news agency, that the then Central American head of state between 1997 and 2002 will be back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend on the penitentiary agents whether they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they send him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how German was constantly transferring government money to a company account in Panama.
This partnership was fictitious and the account actually belonged to his closest family and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 election.
So we got the budget approved.
That's right, I did.
The State Budget was approved.
What's so special about this budget?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with ČSSD's support, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, quietly approved the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Every administration starts and ends with every chapter and budget item, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
It is important to the media and therefore receives special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the last Social Democratic governments suffered from three flaws that for this year 2008 cannot be solved so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the mandators which are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public financing, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This one's public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees and bank credits, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they indebted their municipalities disproportionately.
In recent years they have been able to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They don't have that resource right now.
If we stick to only the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, is going through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, which is something ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to put the state finances in order.
However, the state continued to borrow instead.
The other countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, were far more economical than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, especially in the previous government.
We are among the nations that are least threatened by poverty by global measures.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending passed this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform are not changed soon then it will be the end of any politics in this country and, whoever governs it will be just a simple bureaucracy.
If we are to be a little extreme, we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending from the spending of the presidents.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the previous government had not wasted over the last ten years what they could.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become just officials so we must be patient and give this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make it possible to achieve a balanced State budget gradually.
The following is a list of the candidates for the election:
The banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The monetary market will receive more than a hundred billion dollars through tendering.
In these tenders banks auction off the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to bid, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 9/11, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continuing growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks should be really afraid of what awaits them even when they decided to take this step", said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems accessing loans and will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move by central banks is contributing to the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the collapse of the US housing market.
The environmentalists' debates are incredible.
Global climate change affects especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism has now emerged with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
Klaus said that not only is the conference structure unacceptable, which creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed during the presentation of his book that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said "many times I only encounter the caricature of my ideas".
Now interested parties can find out about their various opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
The main point of the closing speech was that the climate is constantly changing and that changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor are they a potential disaster, and that attempts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Also as a man experienced with totalitarianism he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmentalists but against environmentalists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driving license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for the change so officials give them until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year's Day hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid carnet.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages announce a rapid decline in the change of carnes, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and the interest in the new carnes has increased.
The city estimates about 2,000 customers a day.
You'll be waiting in line for half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet taken out their new driving licences.
The issuance of a new card lasts for 20 days.
However, you can request a card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their licence and do not reach the end of the year but go out on the road without a valid licence will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police officer can fix the infraction with a warning.
If it is an administrative offence, the fine is 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could be fined.
They could pay presumably up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of a thousand crowns, maximum.
According to the transport ministry spokesman, Karel Hanzelka, the 1,000-crown fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not the ID card that every person has to have.
People who do not want to drive should hand over their driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
The year ends when the validity of the carnet issued in 1964 and 1993 is terminated.
However, drivers will have to gradually change their other types of driving licence.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change them.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence of Berdych's accomplices.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The High Court in Prague decided that the sentences for the first offence were reduced to one year and the second to two years.
The Prague crime unit detectives were initially to be given between 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also a defendant in this case but he is the first to be sentenced by the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, in other cases he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't take any more.
In January, the District Court acknowledged the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the Superior Court today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accusations of the accused were rejected by the investigation as fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped criminal gang members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Konyařík.
The charge relates to criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as the theft is concerned, his victims suffered serious health impacts but they are also accused of abusing their power as public servants and without weapons permits.
At the house search, police found a handgun, steel-cord ammunition, a laser gun and a machine gun.
The criminal group, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for nearly 20 men in this trial the court has already found Berdych and the other defendants guilty.
Other men connected to Berdych's case are still testifying from other trials, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech authorities.
A bill to change a few kids: 12 million
For changing some children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, is not in principle in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve such a demand, it's too high", Dostál said after today's meeting.
"To get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescissive value.
We remain of the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone", Dostál said.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol Faculty Hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to psychology and psychiatry specialists, suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better handled by the men although they fought with recriminations for the girls' change.
Women are taking it worse with the trauma they are currently living and with respect to what happens today, Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by nurses at the Třebič Maternity Home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákové in Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each family 100,000 crowns in late October as compensation for the error at the Třebič hospital run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors, they must draw from the reserve fund and in exceptional cases they can ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far awarded them a proportionately low compensation, the sums which were calculated according to the tables to be hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the brand name Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court in Ostrava he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites on the popularity of Bolek Polívka", said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
For him, the words Kingdom of Wallachia make everyone think of the actor and comedian.
The same idea is also held by Harabiš.
"We have about ten years of work behind us.
Search for money and invention of activities", he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is money.
"After years I have realised that the project is successful and that I could get something for it.
They want to live as parasites of our work", he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the mark Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polívka in her television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
Some years later Harabiš came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin came a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use her name and signature on passports and even offered her owners discounts to visitors to her farm and to attendees to her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also ruled that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia", the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began to arise between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen one forever".
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabiš' mediation, resulted in singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company which has been rejected by the court to this day.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already being prepared Harabiš.
He should be the new king.
He has refused to reveal any further details or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It should be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be chosen on a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can present himself", added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices are overcome
I never really liked the Peugeot 206 much.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, manoeuvring and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is a successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This combi called SW is a little more advanced and I, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the headrest space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer from the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I'll go through the inside quickly so I don't repeat too much.
It's an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate more design invention here, although the car already looks pretty stylish.
The seats are comfortable, gone are the days when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral steering has been considerably improved.
And the space, and here you can feel how the body size has grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned lack of headroom disappears.
Bags in the trunk
But the main thing about this vehicle is its trunk.
This one I must rate as very accessible (thanks to the folding back gate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps which are an ideal solution.
They are not annoying, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, it has a capacity of 428 litres at basic speed, which is rather average compared to the competition.
But not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation model from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its noticeable 52 litres.
When on holiday abroad or when placing the stroller, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on anything positive then I should quote the floor that is pretty flat after the second row's backs are down.
120 horsepower in four gears
Our test car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 liters and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 1600 that belittled the familiar five-door should look like.
It's quiet, it consumes little and most of all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the Škoda era back then where it looked like the exhaust pipe was covered with a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices are responding
The price of the car is not for everyone.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested a vehicle that is elegantly equipped and has a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329.900 crowns, you can still.
Our employees put it at 410,900 crowns, which is too much.
The premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbags on the headrests, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, it costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but count on the equipment additions on the Fabia and you'll come up with a pretty similar number.
Now it's just a matter of deciding which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
Children from Eastern European countries attend English schools and so the locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is only presently causing a number of problems.
Even British schools report cases where conflicts between immigrant and native children escalate into violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern town of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brawls among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gotten so bad that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defence, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist slurs.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls showered him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"On our way home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave, he started throwing apples and pears at us, and then he took off his pants and showed us his ass", another unpleasant incident was described for The Times by the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are on both sides.
One native even referred to the conflict with Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the atmosphere in English schools is beginning to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks registered who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really the island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation can come true, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy, golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
The palm trees and the whole enclosed with waiters offering pizza on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean island you can find all this and more.
Only on one island is there much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was criminality in the US (and therefore, prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra. He was a great guy.
In Havana, tall buildings sprang up, and on wide avenues ran the cars that were a cult symbol in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the entertainment world and politicians from all over America have left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also sign your autograph on the walls of the Abane Bodeguita.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, they mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cult cars from the 1950s are still running in Havana today, because those Ladas and Fiats that arrived a long time ago have rusted in these damp and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating markedly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
Sugarcane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar factories by narrow routes in steam or electric machines.
Their cars went undiscovered for decades and now they're there, working machines and whose sister models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The most familiar place for most visitors doesn't change.
And so, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not miss to visit him.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Lush vegetation that grows on limestone soils.
Mogots, pilings of limestone and high cliffs are scattered in the valley's falls, and in its caves acclimatize fertile soil that forms rock slopes that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories can bring you your finished product.
Perhaps someone will find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
The United States
Old Abolengo town that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth turned to beauty with the construction in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has changed little in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is so remote that even in the 1950s there was no road linking it to the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, and therefore nothing was destroyed, for everyone was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worthwhile to visit interesting places in the surrounding area such as Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Other
A small town in the far west of Cuba, considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that view is already confirmed by the road itself.
The two roads that lead there from Guantanamo must pass through high, rugged mountains and a nature that hardly knows man's work.
This eastern part of Cuba has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its untouched nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pines, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, Santería, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, of all this you could fill many pages.
However, as they say, you better see it sometime.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say.
The lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment is what is affecting the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as the conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today, the eight participating states are discussing plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase activity, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid as a priority.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next step is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own", Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to the US military data is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of whom are in the south of the country.
However, for the United States, the Allies have reached the same limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
Exactly what they're asking for is more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them", Gates said.
The European Union is also committed to the fight against terrorism.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that is not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries assisting in recent months have been in dispute over whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for being a liability.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of fighting there are not as high as ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country", Gates said.
The tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting", Sun wrote in a piece of footage accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper responded to the attack and published a photograph of British troops playing a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will reach a trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt in September was 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement in the evolution of the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's national debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For each Czech, the debt is 84,000 crowns.
The State borrowed more than 111 million crowns last year.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the billion-crown mark until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900,000 million and a billion crowns", said Patria Finance economist David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
Vladimir Pikora, an economist at Next Finance, shares this view: "We could cross the trillion during 2009.
Exactly when that will be depends on the next budget which we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see that changing", he added.
Doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The government debt is paid by means of Treasury bonds, government bonds, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state grew this year from 38.500 million to 719.400 million crowns.
The external debt has now grown from 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion krona z since June was reduced by 13.7 billion krona.
The average maturity of the national debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total interannual debt from the first to third quarter created 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly by bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing but it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform", Pikora said.
Better than expected
The 2007 State debt management and payment strategy shows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
In early December, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns, thanks to the improvement in the development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly made up of the state budget deficit, which this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion.
The remainder is made up of the maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of some CZK 13.3 billion, the CZK 10 billion pension reserve, CZK 43 billion for financing state obligations and CZK 1.8 billion in repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
I was comparing Khartoum today to a court for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
Britannia was accused of letting pupils aged six to seven name a teddy bear after Muhammad when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was liable to a punishment of flogging.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with Islamist attacks and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, ages 6 and 7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the classroom.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouths, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a classroom vote, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following caption: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself - he didn't have any tags with this name, but the problem is simply that the depiction of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm just sorry that I asked the children to vote for a name", he said it was just an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many students of the school teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "never talking about religion in class"..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most common name in Britain, spelled in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, having failed to overcome their differences over the future status of the breakaway province.
'It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach agreement on the status,' European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was 'at stake', his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserving peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence at the moment but we are entering a very difficult period", he added, noting that "evident tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90 per cent Albanian, may become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final round of negotiations since the troika was re-commissioned by the UN to mediate last August.
The US and European countries consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West considers independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
'Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached', announced the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these 'last chance negotiations' were held from Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has expressed some of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to killings and deportations".
" Domino effect "
The European Union has also expressed its concern at the recent events in Kosovo, which have led to the deaths of more than 100 people.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia", he said, "this does not mean that a compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be left to the exclusive discretion of the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say "
'Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,' said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sedjiu had told reporters that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the West.
Bush kicks off an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he convened on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations to the peace path agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the core issues".
This designation covers the three main thorny issues at stake in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and address all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among other things".
Returning to the rostrum, Olmert pledged that the forthcoming negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two states" Palestinian and Israeli coexisting by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
The Arab world, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the forefront of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in return for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saoud said in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As with all such incidents, official accounts and rumors are conflicting.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspection General of the French national police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 o'clock, Luisa-Miguel street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but on patrol, and he was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating light", explains a police source.
A Kawasaki green motorcycle, "not approved, that is not authorized to drive on public roads" (see below) and driven by two youths without helmets, was running "on full gas".
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the right-hand pass", police say.
The alcohol control performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (front collapsed, windshields cracked, bumpers torn) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation into "facts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance" to the IGPN, matched with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said the IGPN investigation, at this stage, dismissed the responsibility of the policemen.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the police's version, namely that this minibike came relatively quickly to his left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the socks on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to come to a stop.
The vehicles have been seized and are being subjected to a technical examination.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the scene very quickly, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also rule out 'all serious misconduct' in this respect.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigations, on which we have to be very careful", a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness from these few moments following the accident.
One of his windows that looks precisely at the scene.
"We went down to the hospital with my cousin, who is a nurse, to try to revive them", says the witness.
There was nothing to do".
Then he saw "a completely terrified cop, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone".
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the scene.
According to this witness, the rescue came "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also practiced cardiac massage, to no avail.
"I will not allow the assumption that the police services did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The fire department came right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf imposed the state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter responded with stone-throwing, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been called in.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police shot and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of around 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday drew support from the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose chairman "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the wasteful ones who swore in front of Musharraf".
" Musharraf 's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned with the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
It was to rule in the coming days on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in the presidential elections on 6 October by indirect ballot.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court rulings", the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "has no value anymore" after the imposition of the state of emergency, he told Information Minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as births that are poorly planned or unexpected.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is unplanned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED), 40 years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as births that are poorly planned or unexpected.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5 to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has, however, allowed for better "dominance of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the use rate of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5 percent in 1970 to 60 percent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for one couple in five and if possible for spring, the season judged to be the most pleasant to have a child.
A spectacular repair on the space station
It must have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of space work to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is vital to the station's continued scientific activities.
A risky departure that set records for its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, instruments "snatched" by the astronauts to make the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts released the Harmony module from the Discovery spacecraft, a cylindrical, thick piece of equipment that will soon house European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for the lab-modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5-ton solar-powered power generation module already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began rearranging the module's 76-meter-wide solar panels.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, has been damaged by a cable that got stuck in about a meter.
The deployment has been stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to take a control exit from the shuttle Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snorkeling at the end of the 100-foot long shuttle's remote control arm added to the station's to perform repairs.
He's one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
Tall, tough, very skilled, with a well-developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage precisely, he cut the faulty cable and installed "tablet" types in the damaged area.
He had been helped by a second spacewalker who had stayed near the airlock and, from inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "chopped" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a lunch break before today, seven astronauts return from the shuttle Discovery for the scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS securities listed on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS is currently losing 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast in response to delays caused by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus", the parent company of European aircraft manufacturer EADS announced.
The Commission has already taken a decision on the application of the new rules on the application of the levy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS' operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another programme, the very heavy A380 programme.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the polls: Russians are going to vote massively for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the electorate today with a televised message on public television channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory turns out to be crushing.
Yesterday, the president let nothing get out of hand by hosting foreign ambassadors, content to hand over a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents", he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Ziouganov says there have never been "so dirty elections, even in the time of Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo Soviet"
Behind these unexpected legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever happens, in the legislative elections as in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel they own their destiny", says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society in this Christianized country fell behind Europe by five centuries; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic release", estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "voluntarily renounce personal responsibility" for those who had briefly been tested after the USSR's collapse.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians not voting for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
Those in power are not so bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which describe the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not hitherto accessible only for 'humanitarian' purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The eleven states responsible for managing them - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening took effect yesterday.
The information shall be kept confidential.
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow for searches "particularly on the movements of prisoners, the camp population and the health status of forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the opening of these nominative documents to the public, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain deportation victims.
Records of concentration camps or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or forced to work and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual claims.
However, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest to a part of the scientific community.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents", said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, Indo-European bilateral trade is already worth about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU's foreign ministers gave their approval last April to the European Commission to open negotiations on free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact would greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", explained Peter Mandelson.
The European Commissioner said that Europe was the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India. e Asian and European giants trade annually for "€47 billion in goods" and for "€10 billion in services", Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential".
The report was published on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks.
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current return of concerns over credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the 5.75 per cent base rate in five weeks, an offer of unusual length.
'To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,' it said in a statement.
The bank said 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) would be put on the market on December 6 at 12h15 GMT, at the base rate, and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the Bank of England has put on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "ready to take further steps to keep rates" of interbank lending up to date in line with its base rate.
The interbank daily rate was Wednesday at 5.829%.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, at the most advantageous rates and with more certainty.
The UMP and NC parties refuse to consider the proposals of the PS party on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was written in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS national office, including a 50% increase in the surcharge for employment, the reintroduction of the TIPP (floating internal tax on petroleum products), a transport check or rent restrictions.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the sitting was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition to a few hours of the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft law on rectification of finances examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming to light
In the wake of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who inspired, nothing less, the current festival movement in America", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival was scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 at a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the running of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts around 80 000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organising tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now can accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we're stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones says.
"Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional venue that will ultimately be held in Philadelphia".
C3 Presents resurrected the 2005 Lollapalooza festival at Grant Park in Chicago, after having made a mark on the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, whereas ours is more urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a rural festival impression in the European way and an urban one in the American way".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life".
Charlie Jones says the hotel offerings at this festival are "very big", like the 80,000-person Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been sent out to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators", says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3 members, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal:
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood movie plates to Montreal when nothing but the Terminator is up against it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces runaway productions.
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds conditions in Montreal favourable, he'll go there.
Our role, is to offer those who will judge the best", he says.
The Race to the Festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oscars is on.
All West Coast festivals, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to showcase Quebec films, value them and ensure that filmmakers are interviewed.
Dark Age had a good showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a stock market rally at the end of the year?
With less than five weeks to go before the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be based solely on statistics, especially as uncertainties are looming in the markets in the current context, at least in the short term.'
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking a run in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values both in the long and short stretches".
The report also highlights the need for a more effective approach to the issue of the euro.
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for a lot of joy", says the expert.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% since the highs of November 8 when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Yet, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year as he believes the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Bank, said that we are close to technical levels and "we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US about the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree on the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new highs.
Solana, from Intermoney, says "this year it's the big values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Bank, says the increases will come from banking and the industrial sector.
The manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, if it happens.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit", explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main focus in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological companies will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month only twice.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, the Ibex 35 has recovered 28.17%, December has seen a rebound of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (at the moment the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
It is also the first group to decide to make the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeatedly said it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it's about to close a deal with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of the Popular experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that secures the hours of the shops.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodelling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers on the different streets.
The extension of the opening hours is thus accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more modern design with brighter colours.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, says the restructuring is not a big investment, but rather a larger hiring of staff, as it goes from about six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The branches on Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide hours, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax locations, they will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to make our customers the competition,' says Rivero.
For now, they've reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles its value on the stock market for the first time
We did it.'
With that phrase, he expressed yesterday his satisfaction with Paolo Vasile, Telecinco's CEO, at the close of the market, when he found that the network he was running was doubling the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect clouded his joy: 'It hurts me, not because we have grown more but because we have fallen less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
That gain puts his loss in what we've had this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches EUR 4 488,88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday fell 1.52% and has accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in Prisa (editor of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues this year, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this figure is realised, the TV station would register this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising revenue compared with 965.4 million in 2006.
Antena 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while television's net income increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is too early to make a decision, this ratio could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we can make our shareholders happy, who we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit estimates for Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
This is because, they explain, it has cut the projected revenue growth from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3's profit forecast by 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
The first.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
Two.
Caja Madrid: sees better Telecinco (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'multiple attractions' and upswing in business.
- What?
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases as having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
The Congress approves the transposition of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by the Congress on the amendments to the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure investor protection and to regulate the activity of entities in detail so that markets function efficiently.
The MiFID, which amends the Securities Market Act, aims to modernise financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors in the European Union.
The new rules will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firm (FSI), financial advisory firms (FAs), which join securities firms, stockbrokers and portfolio management companies.
It also extends the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems, which will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law also requires investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Committee on Economics of the Congress, several modifications were incorporated, among which it highlights that securitised debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given their high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in economics and business can perform 30 years after the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
The Senate, for its part, has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for a third party, will not require authorisation from the CNMV and will be able to provide services for marketing products and attracting clients to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised CPI rises by five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which Eurostat then uses to calculate the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of the price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication is in line with Eurostat and the European Central Bank's (ECB) policy of providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The forward indicator is calculated using the same procedure as for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be made public on December 14.
"The CPI will remain at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise in the IPC by 4.1% in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the differential of inflation in Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%", the minister of Economy said of the data.
Virgin plans to raise $42,000 million from Northern Rock in three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time it had record deposits of over £25,000 million, a figure that has fallen steadily in two and a half months because of the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and which it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trading brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the income in British banks deposited over the next three years to get those remaining 18 billion pounds until it reaches the target of 30 billion.
The group of wealthy Richard Branson, known for its flashy advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium's offer, which includes three other companies, as its favorite to bail it out of bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the head of the police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then regent of the municipality, and who according to sources of the research consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents are still checking the municipal offices and the Urbanism Counseling and no more arrests are ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As yesterday was reported by the SER chain, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, so aforetime, was stopped leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to recalibrate 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE's secretary of organisation, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the party's federal headquarters with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also pointed out that "it seems" that the manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as Congress president, who made public on November 15 his decision not to stand in the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to fighting climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the government president has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he takes office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or scream". and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak with tranquility and tranquility is the Congress, the President of the Government was interrupted in the Senate 26 times".
He also praised his current president, Manuel Marín, for his "good work" and did not want to see himself occupying his position to avoid falling into what he said his opponents might see as "prepotence".
Propaganda on the climate
As the climate change movement mercilessly persecutes both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is forced to show iron coherence.
And a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his government has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why your government, the one with the planet contract, has not prevented it.
It also requires him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spanish people what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences will it have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have been no such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, inconvenient and threatening to corporate and individual accounts.
Even the penny of petrol suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
So it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans with no real consequences.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we ride a bicycle or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for a suspected urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the secretary of the City Council and a hostel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and taken to the Consistory, where he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Urbanism Department and the municipal company managing the Industrial and Housing Soil.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made on Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalibration of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land into urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which is instructed by the Juzgado número 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been released today.
According to sources, the former Totana regidor and now PP's regional parliamentarian, Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of an in-house agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former regidor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is being carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested at the time in Totana, namely the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the region, who may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcia municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2,2 million square meters of land in Totana that was reclassified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Viguese parking lots of the streets of A Coruña, Venezuela and the plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that happen
The first.
If you like, we'll leave the Book of the Month thing to rest, see if in the meantime we can think of another priori and other competitions.
I'm already working on something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you're invited to propose inventions.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment from yesterday in Finland's leading newspaper (by the way at the top of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what was published on November 18, the same day as the criticism of Blackburn's book appeared there, curiously:
"The content of the Philosophy signature has leaped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy at Jokela school.
The culprit in the deaths, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Councillor in charge of the Philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude toward Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes".
- What?
A colleague passes on information about the introduction of Internet downloading offenses in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a felony punishable by six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal records in the store for less than 400 euros, it is considered a simple misdemeanor (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from a store up to €1,000, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the penalty for unloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous brawl carries a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and exchanging would carry a penalty of six months to two years
The Court of Justice of the European Union has consistently held that the Commission's decision to initiate proceedings is not imputable to the State.
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without authorization from the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's getting a hand out of the door, a very long one.
4 and 4.
My primary care physician leaves me one of his articles on rare research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.'
In other words, the feelings generated by the workers' monthly pay depends on what the coworkers earn.
The study was carried out by MRI scans at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and head of the Neurocognitive Imaging group at the Life& Brain Institute in Germany, "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that if both were paid the same amount of money when they were right, the activation was moderate, but if one was paid twice as much, the activation was higher.
I don't know if it took that much science to make that conclusion.
The prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter-sweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on that list from which the title of the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) is taken, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is good for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible accidents, is a major expense that depends on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of vehicle.
First of all, we have to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed premium in return for being liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is set taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of the vehicle, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely you are to have an accident, the higher the premium.
This is why both men and women over 25 have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower accident rate because of their prudence.
Also, using counting, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency and, with it, the likelihood of some kind of accident.
The more frequent the odds.
There are many variables that insurance companies take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver must study the situation carefully to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will explain here the most important factors in choosing one type of insurance, so that it is not only adapted to the characteristics of the insured but also offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 face several disadvantages when purchasing insurance at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and the age of the licence.
Although all-risk insurance is the ideal way to be well insured, other cheaper options exist.
The more cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk, all-expense policy, so that they get the coverage of an all-risk insurance policy at a more affordable price.
This type of arrangement would involve the customer paying a part of the amount of the loss.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the client contributes will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", says Luis Noguera, chief executive of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer is insured against damage caused to third parties, but not against damage caused to his own car.
In addition, you would be covered for theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on the basic tariff.
"Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses", Noguera explains.
After the age of 25, it is easier for drivers to take out insurance, since accidents are reduced by accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire a franchise with a risk.
"Young people are not usually able to use their previous experience in handling accidents, even driving", says the European company's manager in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, after the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but has no children yet, it is preferable to negotiate an all-risk insurance, provided that his financial situation allows it, of course.
On the other hand, children are considered by insurers to be the public with the lowest rate of injury, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk one with deductible (which may be EUR 300), or, where a high level of bonus is available, an extended third party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They drive more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchising", sentences Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out an all-risk insurance policy with deductible (€150), or an extended third party insurance policy if the bonus is high.
Car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver against possible accidents but also because it is a major expense.
Celtic are looking for a point in Milan worth the eighth.
Milan and Celtic are meeting on Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as the Italians are serving to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured their pass with a draw in Portugal on the fifth day, while Celtic have nine points, but still need another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and who receive Benfica, who have four, do not get ahead.
These two matches in Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan have to play in the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place in the round of 16.
So this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although both teams will try to go out for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic know that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in the eighth.
Gordon Strachan's team could use even a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct match.
Thus, the Milanese will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are hoping to get into the eighth round for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal from Kaka in extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the Rossoneri's victory will be Shakhtar who only deserves the win, in case Celtic loses, both to get into the round of 16 and to stay in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a win, with which the UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls' Vancouver tour
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before their gig at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out for the concert, which included a video that told the story of the band that made waves in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that features their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain is published by EMI.
The five Spice Girls took the stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that crowded GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had forbidden him from doing so days earlier.
In the preview of the show's opening, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "hasn't seen our wardrobe, at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for differences between us" led to the quintet's dissolution two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press conference, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feeling in the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision", Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of nannies were waiting for them.
Between the five of them, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They'll be performing in Madrid on December 23.
New fears over gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia's fuel exports to Western Europe.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are routed through Ukraine, so every touch between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopoly gas owner Gazprom, trying to agree on how much money Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge Ukraine more, as it has committed to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transit routes for gas during the talks", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly drove up prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it is still not fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supplies with Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
"the NHS will have to test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to check the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
Auditor General Robert Black's recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea how many foreign staff it has.
However, their report pointed to other checks being carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor-General checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European Economic Area following the attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep into the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses Disclosure Scotland to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Great Britain.
The auditor general's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal checks in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review", the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: 'our report highlights areas where improvements can be made to ensure that the necessary information is available on the number of foreign NHS staff.'
BMA Scotland president Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is", he explained.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residency permits.
The investigation also found that the screening procedures set by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being broadly followed.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualifications checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the policy and guidance on pre-employment of foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "There was a strong interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish Government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the updating of the pre-employment control guidelines for all work groups - including foreigners - which they were planning to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biographical film about the late Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Film award.
The trophies were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast as Curtis, to director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes from a Scandal".
And the Bond star, Daniel Craig, won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced for just £3,000.
But also the winner was Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, awarded two awards - best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the chauffeur of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's film Promises from the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hardball, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after Harry Potter and Camelot star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me", he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor".
The Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
An eight-member cell of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern Province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world's largest oil refinery, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Saudi Interior Ministry, said 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining as al-Qaeda militants to fight allied forces and supporting the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Sunni Saudis.
Al-Qaeda militants have targeted many clerics in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by calls from Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, to harass the country's pro-Western government - targeted residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, five months of work", the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
The arrests also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims deemed infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may give us a glimpse into Earth's future
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had been previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and orbit, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion from solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is high enough to melt lead, and it is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency's Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a glimpse of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes because of climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago".
Police seized "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy of presidential candidates to answer a snow monkey's questions.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them to be broadcast among the candidates.
None of the questions presented on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 28th were more ridiculous than the one the snow monkey asked Democrats about climate warming at the YouTube Republican Party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican Party ahead of next year's election.
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN, who co-sponsored the debate, chose the YouTube videos to showcase the candidates as candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest ever devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to dial up when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The most violent word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national trailblazer, and Mr. Romney, who has been leading in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation for being soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate would support an "amnesty" (allowing illegal immigrants to regularize their situation and give them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted on the immigration issue before the others.
At least on immigration, and more broadly, the candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fears of China's toxic toys and other concerns about the outside world, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned awkward when other issues came up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all odds, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed that Jesus was too smart to run in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rising in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns, and his heated Wednesday debate statements.
They both came out of the bottom, because the two wings of the party couldn't agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the early party convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.

Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but he still emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
It doesn't seem to be influences being sold, nor are it exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, nor extramarital finger-suckers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British governing Labour Party of over £650,000 ($1.3 million) for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not report him.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a struggling bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it's the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is walking irrevocably to the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he has little time left, that suspension is too much: public officials start to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press looks for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
As much as I'd like to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the exchequer.
And even though he's not directly involved in the Blairish mishaps - or "cash for partners", the investigation into political party funding - voters can assume he is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to make them look.
Like Mr. Bean, no one's been killed or ripped off directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not his.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and there's a clear reason: the public has a right to know who's buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's deal, and that it wasn't illegal, will obviously be facing Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising manager who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is so far not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but he's diluted in decision-making over a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Standards Committee on Public Life, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also push for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard co-operative work by Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial status that is enjoyed by the unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he has to face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is by acting with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural for some dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today, as the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already showing.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been repaid or are more than 30 days late, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 million in its American consumer finance business, in part due to weakness of card borrowers.
It's too early for panic, though.
Late payments and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3.89 percent was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American bankruptcy law of individuals (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn represented a large loss on credit cards; the number of filings (and therefore, delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay off each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty solid, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emissions volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to load debts onto credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than at assets, so falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' creditworthiness.
They can even work to out-compete the issuers.
The incentives for consumers to keep paying off the mortgage decrease if the property is worth less than the loan value, and as a result, paying off the card debt rises to the top of the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions than mortgage lenders, by changing interest rates or altering creditors' balances.
That should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid asset reassessment.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their role in the fraud with former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at Royal Bank, became a celebrity cause in Britain over extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were for alerting Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to fabricate a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron corporation controlled by Fastow, who was the mastermind behind a myriad of scams at Enron, which helped spiral it into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three Britons knew it would rise.
A company under Kopper's control bought the bank interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the 20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers took in $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was found guilty on two counts of conspiracy to cause the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide millions in debt or make its failing businesses look successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than $60 million in market equities and more than $2 million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction on conspiracy, fraud and other charges was stayed when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers", says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But nobody asks for that model with so many seats because it's for private family flights or for company presidents".
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center outside the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had set up their booths, hoping to lure the newly wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany-armored yachts to 50-cent diamond-encrusted car grills.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche in the booth next to his".
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and brass compared to us", he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets".
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was at its peak.
"We had the same thing in 1890 when some wealthy Americans came to Europe to meet, where they were seen as materialistic", says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
"Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest consumers and spenders".
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the pie.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion dollars, according to Forbes' list of richest people.
In addition, the second-rich include 103,000 Russian billionaires whose wealth reaches $670 billion, according to a study of personal wealth trends in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were living below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here", says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jeweler David Morris.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"The women are impeccably dressed and the men are very dignified".
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in evening gowns, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Yumatova, who reeled off the designer suit she wore as a veteran red carpet dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of shoppers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum fountain pens, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 USD).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of Delft's Royal Dutch Porcelain in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said that wealthy older Russians (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade show.
Yet, several thousand people - cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists - fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress systems for $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car grilles shaped like chain bracelets, for Rolls Royce Phantom, for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconia cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels", says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars".
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British style) telephone booths filled with piles of fake one million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire's Fair.
Visitors would stop to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", says Karryev.
"Snap" surgery could be a cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the A Little Healthier restaurant and saw an ambulance coming up White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police car showed up.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up", said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died".
Authorities have learned that the dead woman is Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Ave. home.
Authorities have yet to determine the cause of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they're waiting for the tox screen, although the results won't be available for a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has plagued the Newark police force's senior ranks.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant to the chief of police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious", Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian".
She was protecting me".
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Liquor Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one possibility", Walsh declared.
"It's an ongoing investigation".
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
November 21st and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh couldn't say if Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine what part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a withered rose bush is located in the front of the house, and a barking dalmatian in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located on the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hanging on hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the NYPD, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, 'You have to watch out with this or that,'" she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing".
The Fed is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market.
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to ease credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were heightened by reassuring comments from the vice chairman of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two to Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued financial market stress.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing credit-exchange samples, Mr Kohn said the recent turmoil was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October".
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street amid bad news for the US economy, such as home sales hitting a record low in October.
The fallout from the financial turmoil was accentuated by an announcement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost cut to offset losses on its U.S. sub-prime mortgage investments.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to come to London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at close to 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's top companies.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the re-emergence of credit stress on the markets was highlighted following strong demand at a three-month auction of funds by the European Central Bank, which valued these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the lead of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the London stock markets, strained credit and three-month LIBOR lending rates among British banks, which meant the biggest rise since September, at 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara's demands to court
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat England's No. 6 in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And none of them are less important than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the national team who is on loan - with that particular title at least - is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, England manager, is starting to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part-time one.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth batting title will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the bottom level, sometimes out of bad luck rather than ability.
It's not just in cricket that choice is difficult, as it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it just the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does it?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, were promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who's to say what a good level is for a cricketer, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a big influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time as taking a wicket and a batsman to get chances to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who is certainly playing in the first Test even if Stephen Harmison declares for fit and bowls like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs for each to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but they both had their high times and can expect more of these.
Shah or Bopara games at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every Test and did well in the first one, with 5 wickets and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a key player, and despite scoring a double century against Australia in Australia, he may still be underrated.
Chances are Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah's favour is his brilliant and valuable Test debut early in '88 in Mumbai, 32 first-class centuries versus only 6 from Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home ground as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his batting some of the momentum that he had in Mumbai.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live on swords.
He gets caught up in everything on the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his car at an exhibition for the UK car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking in the distance, to say excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he's including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he bats with confidence and skill.
Picking the right man is one thing, picking the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selecting.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean Shah doesn't stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses carrying Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who ran out of cash, visa extensions and were waiting for the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that it's safe now".
"They say the army of the Mahdi stopped killing people", he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease momentarily.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni Amariyah area, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that an allied US force had helped push Al-Qaeda out of their stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the chief of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues".
"That is why I have returned today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since US troops have entrenched groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, voiced a common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country because of sectarian death gangs.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government supports criminals who burned my house down after I left".
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been driven out of the Shiite areas and vice versa, easing tensions.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and start fighting.
The little Saar, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
As in the whole country, the Saarlanders lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a non-Sarlandese that we are not French" - that was the ironic motto about themselves of the smallest federal state for its 50th anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system in the Saarland, which in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" was ranked fifth.
Thus, higher education institutions have traditionally enjoyed good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Even today students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than the average in the upper secondary schools.
"The Saarland takes advantage of the vocational education system", says Axel Plünnecke, the education expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people finish their secondary education at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is 7 percentage points above the national average.
The range of possibilities for vocational education and training is very wide.
The offer of dual careers, in relation to the number of inhabitants, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Science has fallen by a third in recent years.
This was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced the higher education institutions to advertise more for engineering specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms in general education schools", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative testing nationwide.
In order to get the children to start their final year of study as soon as possible, the project called "Kita-Jahr" is free of charge.
Comparison with future studies will show whether it has increased pupil performance.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students with school-leaving backwardness decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saarland did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students are better at calculating.
To the dismay of the Saarlanders, the PISA report does not compare foreign language skills, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlans are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in secondary schools.
Chavez is changing the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez changes the time in the South American country by moving the clock back half an hour.
Currently Chavez is staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported in the Official State Bulletin, according to the new law, the time will be minus four hours GMT.
This will give the South American country a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do it", says Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil-rich country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chávez said that Uribe's decision offended Venezuela.
In Spain too, much is said about Chávez.
A new call tone is causing a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to one forecast, a fall in real wages threatens German employees this year despite a strong economic situation.
Experts present a host of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage bill in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The blame for this lies in the weak wage developments, the rise in value added tax and the tightening of food and energy prices", reports Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Cycles Research in the newspaper "Bild".
New unemployment insurance charges may also be imposed on employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is just and reasonable.
The employment office, of course, does not have to get into a bad situation again by asking the Federal State for loans and subsidies, as one German Social Democrat politician put it.
On Tuesday, it was made public that the rate of inflation with the explosion in prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level in 13 years.
Compared with last year, prices are up 3%.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Despite its atmosphere not being suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that had not been considered until now.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that lightning might exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning strikes from a height of 34 miles [54 km] from one cloud to another, says Cris Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles to the scientific journal Nature.
According to the famous Urey-Miller model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
Venus is not like that: if life ever existed there, it would have to be in one of the earliest stages of evolution", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and the surface temperatures are 500°C, fluctuating in such a way that temperatures can reach below zero.
"Venus may be a 'devil' twin of Earth, but it's still a twin", Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest results of the research, which will be presented in many articles in Nature, underline, in the opinion of the researchers, not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that the neighboring planets have more features in common with Earth than we had assumed", reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers also discovered a faster-spinning cloud vortex in the south polar region.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the upper atmospheric layers of the Earth's poles, as described by a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has a mass almost equal to that of the Earth and is almost as large at its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers.
This planet, also called the morning star or evening star, orbits the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day on Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with its surface temperatures of 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit [4,660°C] and atmospheric pressure of 92 bar, bears little resemblance to Earth, scientists assume that both planets formed under similar conditions.
On both planets, water had clumped up, which on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had turned into carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end this fight over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation", Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"While I have great respect for cultural differences, human rights are absolutely important to me", said Koehler.
The German Foreign Minister stressed that everyone knows that Germany must act with great balance in foreign policy, defending Merkel for the reproach she received for pursuing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of the One China policy.
China knows it too", said Koehler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was attacked by the Union members because of this.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its ineffective foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Finance Minister, but also, according to news sources from the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that German Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to receive the religious leader of Tibetans in his official position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like the ones in France.
Street fights with police, gunfire, car burnings: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns of riots like the one in France.
The Federal Minister demands that everything possible be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from spreading to the streets.
Barricades were erected, vandals fired on police with rifles: after serious riots by young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must also make sure that the social problems of our country do not take a violent form".
"We have to take this seriously", he told the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not all young people are able to cope with the ever-changing social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference: all this is already bearing its first fruits".
It's still too early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble pointed out that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youths staged serious street riots with the police in northern Paris last night.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
The Turkish Community in Germany called on the Federal Government to make greater efforts for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitation effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Despite everything, the performances are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 is above average.
We must ensure that there are more vocational training places.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany, more than in France, "there is a great social control in families", greater than in the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But we still have to be careful".
The aim is to 'provide young people with the opportunity to get a job or vocational training more quickly'.
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and cars burned.
Since the day before a team of almost 1000 policemen is dealing with security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of the Interior, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot started with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the deaths of the youths were not the fault of the police.
In the realm of Angela Wolke.
The Federal Chancellor's actions, far from reality, show that the coalition has reached its end of its content and that nothing more can be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, indifferent and unconcerned performance in the general debate in the House, it must be said that she does not live in the country she should be governed by.
As for the reproach that was made to her for having repeatedly devoted herself to foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and so he showed he did not want to understand what the critics are interested in.
The House has made it very clear to everyone that this reproach is appropriate.
There was no interest or feeling for the country's problems.
But instead Angela Wolke presented herself as this: a very high policy that flees into foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: climate change prevention: she praised herself highly for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party could not afford such modesty.
Well, he's got a way of making expressions so that people can get an impulse.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in Angela Wolke's realm, inner problems are appearances of little value.
The poverty of children and the worries about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It's amazing how often you get it wrong when it comes to the baby supplement.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He starts to stumble "like he's been in uncharted territory", when it came to more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated YouTube Republican presidential candidate debate and now they have to fear only an outside candidate.
Tensions between the candidates are apparent from the outset.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a haven for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani responded with a sharp rebuke: "I would like to say that his own home was a 'port' for illegal immigrants".
Candidates are prone to attack: as the Republican group has no clear favorite so far, the eight presidential candidates are taking advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The short 30-second videos, shot by internet users and uploaded to YouTube, also don't have much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power", was John McCain's rebuke to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam War veterans when he refuses to recognize waterboarding, a method of interrogation, as torture, by letting a person drown to simulate their death.
The reactions of the audience in the room in St. Petersburg, Florida show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded loudly when they praised conservative values and denied tax increases.
That way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong back then", Romney explains, apologizing to people and television audiences for being an advocate for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, was at a loss for words when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf rules without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
Thus ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, was sworn in for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he handed over his command of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning as Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is an end to the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will soon lift the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since the state of emergency was declared in the Supreme Court, many jurists have been supportive of Musharraf. Last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the controversial new election of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" took part in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written in the best era of the band.
They were already very famous in foreign countries.
The presence of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused a sensation.
Each one of them has his little box, his wires and above all his buttons in front of him.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, wearing a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes its own sounds, even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
The point here is this: the questions accurately showed that the band name resonated in people's minds, but it wasn't something so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend from the 1970s?
Especially because the misnomer Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music prize to the members of the Cologne band Can 2003 for their life's work, the surprised faces of the German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother would spend time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad are one and the same.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and in those times did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, that promised much fame.
At first they played in the basement of the Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Düsseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in the Commune I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more like an artist's life full of surprises.
They say that one day a banner of Ottenstein's Harmonia singing association appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages to using the Harmonia name.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just about knowing yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announced their split.
Rother eventually got involved in esotericism and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since then has been more successful than Harmonia.
The live recording of the album at Griessmer, that's thanks to Groenemeyer.
His music company Greenland set itself the goal of cultivating this German-specific contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius' work, the Neu! band was rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There's also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was vacant.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future".
There are photos of Harmonia with producers on a farm.
The story of the legend's development is shown in black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
In the background are three veterans who started improvising again.
They simply attach the microphones to the organ and the drums so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is now what it was meant to be.
Three people who are deep in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere, one coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68!" is right too, but now Harmonia is calm.
On stage, you reflect very well on what is already obvious.
Where does the music begin and end?
It can break your nerves or give you a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere is just missing more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But neither of them had much conviction.
Either the concepts are too focused on action and gunfights or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it was there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant, low-profile roles in women's movies and after many press conferences about Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument for maybe watching the movie "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he chases" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and silly nowadays?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the viewer: at bottom, his role as a war reporter is a presentation of what Richard Gere could have done, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is a German production and will also be released this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The film's meaning is lost to the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again being presented as the only culprits.
The movie is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two occasions), the story about American reporters in the war who go to track down a Serbian war criminal called "fox", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
So the stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountains twice to do something the army can't do, and each time it's a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we are introduced to Simon Hunt at the beginning, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim woman who they're going to kill later.
So "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed accomplish what NATO, CIA and all the headhunters in the world failed to do for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave it to the Bosnian Muslims to exact their fair revenge.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and highlights that the Americans and French are not really concerned about prosecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, you'll think of a very famous Brecht poem.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad".
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not just the genre of war films in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It may also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
One rule almost always applies: when a star gets into a crisis region or into minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Over All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio pops up.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It's got to be at least decades before Hollywood rolls out a good Holocaust movie, like Schindler's List.
Some films need more time, and classics like the Vietnam War movies "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now", or "Full Metal Jackett" were not universally hailed as masterpieces in their day.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is shown live on two television sets at home.
And that's because screenwriters don't have the slightest qualms (that are necessary to be able to) to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to make a movie.
Maybe we should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic, distant look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change".
The big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives as a response the negative criticism about the Olympics.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue to fight for the competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust reminds us to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, said on Wednesday that the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
No other project in the big city has recently generated as much excitement as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level".
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions to host the Summer Olympics would not be realised until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides", von Beust says in WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sport Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this time period, which we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance".
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements made by von Beut.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to let the opportunity go, if at this moment the plans are ruined", said HSB director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public High School Sports Federation (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for Universities 2015 not as "a substitute" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
Just last week the High School Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) criticised the Senate for not using the valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate was behind in the development of the small Grasbrook district, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses", said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, members of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics was met with great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
If you think of Sweden and a wooden box, you think of Ikea, but you don't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Today, wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like a shadow that weighs on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of the 94 "type" Glow-Box on this list are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six Brillo-Boxes, which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to Moderna Museet, are fake, and almost a hundred of the other "Stockholm-type" ones, which are in circulation on the international art market, are also.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painting the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet, hundreds of Brillo-cardboard boxes were on display.
These were not works of art, but copies (which were only objects) on display.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol was allowed to produce in Sweden some wooden Shine-boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as original "Stockholm-type" "Brillo-Boxes" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were sold at auction for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous museum director Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exhibited almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the museum's conservators at Moderna Museet, investigated six Museum-owned Brillo-Boxes and also three Swedish private-owned ones that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight plates.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Shine-Boxes", says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet, adding that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York fails to reach a conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibits.
Already in July the Commission of Authentication formally announced that it accepted these "serious allegations" that they were boxes of soap dust.
But from that moment on, everything was silent.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The head Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Almost 200 soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, and suddenly he was able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military police who were supposed to watch him had joined their ranks and continued their mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops have blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
"People are fed up", Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join our ranks".
General Danilo Lim, who formerly led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The government's biggest critics called for a big demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months, his government has been criticized for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a spotlight spot for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups in the Philippines against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares in the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for a share is 14,46 euros.
You only have 20.05% of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company being absorbed.
There are also options to further increase the financial part in Versatel.
United Internet reported that it intends to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market by taking this step.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution holds the equity securities for a third party partner.
United Internet had already the day before made telecommunications company Drillisch a shareholder with almost 10 percent.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17,4 million of the new shares, which are worth EUR 106,4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products.
"We are strengthening our collaboration", the United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that initially, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they make 18.49 percent of Freenet participate.
This meant that both companies retained all options, in particular the participation in the Freenet joint stock company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet, which will last for many months and is not very understandable, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the United Internet and Drillisch holding company directly held 6.01% of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
