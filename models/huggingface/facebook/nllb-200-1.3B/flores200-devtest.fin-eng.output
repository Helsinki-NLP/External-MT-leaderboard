This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also yielded information not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
The animal's feather coat, according to the researchers, was chestnut brown on top and light or carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
The discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed part called the feather, but they do have other feather features  such as toughness and feathery rays  the researchers concluded that the feather is likely a later stage of evolutionary development with these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used, not for flight, but for thermal adjustment or sound effects. Although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the researchers found evidence that it came from the feather suit of an adult, not from the feathers of a young.
Although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the researchers presented the sample as coming from the feather suit of an adult individual, not from the fangs of a young.

The work was initially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to detect tidal effects between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the gravitational pull of the moon affects the earth, causing tides, so does the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affect the dwarf elliptical galaxy of the Arrow.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it in a kind of beam and is made up of a large number of tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been not state-of-the-art: voters lock themselves in a box and put a pre-printed paper slip in an envelope, on which they have marked the candidate they want.
Once the identity of the voter has been confirmed by the authorities, the voter drops the envelope in the polling station and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law has determined the course of events with relative precision.
In 1988 the ballot boxes were made transparent so that voters and observers could prove that there was no envelope in the box at the start of the vote and that no envelope was added to the box other than the officially counted and authorised votes.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each stage of the event, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with the procedures laid down.

Deputy Inspector D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped a Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused have been announced as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed when the ambulance released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of his son.
He's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may have been corrupted, as his photograph has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the courts have found that the publication of images may be detrimental to a fair trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists do seem to be dangerously balancing out if they publish suspicious photos and so on".
The Crown Office, the Scottish Prosecutor's Office, which has overall responsibility for the charges, has given the journalists a hint that they will not comment further on the matter, at least until the charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to its border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to run the way they did before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other subjects reportedly discussed were the future status of holy Jerusalem for both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for 10 years from the signing of the agreement, which the Palestinian Authority will only allow for five years.
The forest rangers were to monitor closely the shooters participating in the supplementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited as part of a joint project between the National Park and Wildlife Service and the Australian Shooting Association (ASF) in NSW and as part of the AMU's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, NPWS's acting director for parks and heritage conservation, the four shooters selected for the first shots received extensive safety and training.
Martelly recognised nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Interim Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth interim council in four years.
Last month, a presidential delegation recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelli's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which have occasionally turned violent, were triggered by the failure of elections, some of which were scheduled to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four persons.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of the accident involving 27 devices.
Last week, the ministry said that Apple had told it of 34 other cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the investigation "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (on Friday at 9:19 p.m. Greenwich time).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency said there had been no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the photographers from the Philippines.
Later, the photographers took over for an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom, and Mendoza was killed in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, an official investigation team found two black boxes, or flight recorders.
The other wrestlers also showed respect for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and Luna died in the middle of the night, two months ago, a rather unusual case, as was she herself, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I love her and miss her... and I hope she's in a better place".
Around 1,400 respondents were surveyed in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, with the number of people opposed to becoming an Australian republic rising by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled shared his view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of respondents thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three-pointers at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition has been precarious because of the pain.
He has not been able to take the pain medication needed because it is prohibited in the competition.
On January 25, computer science professor and mathematician Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime ever known.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery with various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to the earth as well as organic matter that can make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how the earth was formed, for comets struck the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year, and last month he signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political slurs and ridiculous".
He's supposed to run for president in 2016.
The USDA claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based probes, allowing air traffic controllers to better locate aircraft and provide pilots with accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and no overland trains stop at Wembley, nor are parking and attached parking facilities available at the venue.
Concerns about the lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the evolution of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University said that the new species had evolved in two generations, although the sequence of events was thought to last much longer, because of the mutual breeding of the native Darwin's peacock (Geospiza fortes) and the newcomer cactus shark (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes, and it can also be cut into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be twisted and spun, hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted pictures of books called "book paintings".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can do it yourself using the juice of red cabbage.
The color of the cabbage juice varies depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (pH H) in the test chemical indicates the pH.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts to the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappan and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of irrigation systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed in the same spaces at the same time.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched in a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet long.
The bike has changed the world in incredible ways, and the fact that it's so much easier and faster to move is the greatest thing the bike has done for us.
It has given us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized felines, which eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which are much larger in number.
The secret to their success is what is called the ecological box, a concept that says that each cat has a special function that makes it uncompetitive.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called herds.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and sometimes as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The leopard behaves much like a wolf or a dog, reminiscent of a lion (but not other large cats), and is also very dangerous to its prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong human.
The tiger is a member of the big cat family (Panthera), along with the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can bark.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but rather a phrase consisting of a few words shouted out.
The oselots prefer to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if they catch them, and almost all the animals the oselots prey on are much smaller than themselves.
Researchers believe that the oselots track and find edible animals by sniffing the land they have been on, or by smelling the prey.
The oselots have very good night vision thanks to their dim light and their movements are very subtle, they hunt by blending into their environment and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves to a mountain range or across a river or to a new island, it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from the one it was before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but still needs the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the main population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, each population will look so different from the other that it can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process diversification, which just means the creation of a new species, and diversification is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they use carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.
Plants produce their food by harnessing the sun, and they tolerate shade.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we eat most of our food out of plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was a great beast of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and its extra set of teeth on its jaw prevented any of its enemies from escaping.
We are not sure, but it may have had a branched tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, something even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex would not have been able to do.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own strange or unusual celebrations, such as wild boar, roe deer, quail, and rodent called the peanut.
The second difference was that the poor and the women ate their meals sitting down, while the rich preferred to have communal meals, where they would chew on their side while eating.
The meals of ancient Rome could not serve the kind of food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia only in later centuries.
They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs by ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open inner courtyard and then the inner Holy, the Most Holy, which was open only to priests.
Sometimes temples were built with pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurates.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women prepared food in the yard, and shops were just open market stalls along the street, with stone as the building material for the houses.
Because of the lack of extensive forests in Canaan, timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norwegian sagas, it was said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the island was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The reverse side of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that a large parchment document (measuring 29 3‚ÅÑ4 inches by 24 1‚ÅÑ2 inches) was originally wrapped in a scroll for preservation.
It is therefore likely that the marking was merely added as a nameplate.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was occupied by the so-called Vichy France, or the French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders and did not fight them at all.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1944, code-named Operation Dragoon.
The American and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and turned toward Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is common to a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civilian or citizen, and it's related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city state, and it also kind of defines the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations.Civilized culture refers to the transfer of knowledge from several generations to another, to a long-term cultural footprint and to widespread diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any necessary historical evidence, so they are generally not considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the 13 states first formed a weak central government, the only component of which was the Congress, under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it had to rely on the often uncooperative state authorities for the enforcement of all its laws. 
Nor did it have the power to change tax laws and interstate customs duties.
The amendment of the Articles required the unanimous approval of all the L√§nder, and the L√§nder were so overly concerned with the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world after the German national team, winning the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swordsmanship, cycling, hockey, roller skating and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians even compete in them at international competitions and the Olympics.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan is the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because Japan's islands are grouped together, Japan is often referred to as an "island" in a geographical sense
Taiwan was known as early as the 15th century when European navigators who passed by named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a change in the native people's methods of grain production and hiring Chinese laborers for their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a Qing Dynasty province in 1885.
After defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonosek, which ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most commonly used film size in the world is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced, but above all, it has been inherited by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
A little confusingly, the 35mm is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest aspect ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and much mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline to create dynamics in the image while still maintaining some order.
According to it, the most efficient location of the main focus is at the point where the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be closely examined.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
The power it exerted everywhere affected everyone, kings and people.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money is intended for that very use.
The central church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such concentration of power and money caused many to question the fulfillment of the doctrine.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began the German naval blockade.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supplies to soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified in numerous international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean areas and endangered even neutral ships.
Since the tactics aroused only limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and states.
The nations ended the horrors and atrocities of World War I in the hope of avoiding a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of describing different periods of time: Each stage of China, or each ruling dynasty, had its own dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of unstable division of provinces between each dynasty, the most well-known of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in Xi'an's majestic palace.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the nationality doctrine, and the belief that the land belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, the offices were also opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the army, for military ranks were now based on ability rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of everyday life, and he often meditated in a cave that came to be known as Hira, located on Mount Nur, the symbol of light.
The cave itself, left alone by the tooth of time, gives a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on one of the mountains rising north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's very difficult to find even if you know it exists, and once you get inside the cave, the isolation is perfect.
All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, and inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the earthly world.
The Giza plain, or necropolis of Giza, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx of Giza.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The up arrow sign looks like a V, and the down arrow sign looks like a thread or a square without a underscore.
A rising bow means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and a falling bow means that you should start at the fross (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A rising bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow is stronger and more rugged.
You are free to add your own notes with a pencil, but remember that the printed punctuation marks are in the notes for musical reasons, and should generally be followed.
A mob of working women forced the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister Elisabeth from Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They came back to Paris in carriages, surrounded by a mob, shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their chariots wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd shook the head of a bodyguard killed at Versailles in front of the shocked queen.
The Filipino people had to pay for the war costs incurred by the conquest of the Philippines for US imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States, which covered a considerable part of the cost, and to take care of the interest on the bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of US imperialism was, of course, the huge profits from the long exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the temple gentlemen, one must understand the background against which the organization was born.
The period of events is usually referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term which in practice covers a wide range of ideas from the so-called pushing force of technology, or the necessity of technology, to the absolute notion that human destiny is governed by scientific laws and their manifestation in logic based on technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic assumptions: first, that technological development itself follows a path largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence; and second, that technology in turn has natural rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
For example, one might argue that the invention of the automobile inevitably led to the development of roads.
On the other hand, the national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars leads to more road accidents, leading to new methods of health care to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a major element in Romanticism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen as shaping individuals, and over time, the customs and culture typical of this geographical location were shaped, and because these were in harmony with society, they functioned better than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100.
Its status was weakened in the 12th century mainly because the crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the supply of the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the prestige of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 9th and 11th centuries, and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western European styles may have lagged behind by 25-30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the period was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothing during the Crusades.
Self-employed farming is farming that produces enough food to feed only the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficiency is a simple, often nature-based system, whereby natural seeds are used in an ecosystem in combination with co-farming or other relatively simple methods to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-employed, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel they are rejecting the norms of society and thus are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished on the basis of age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct and distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality, geographical or a combination of several factors.
Often, members of a subculture communicate their membership through stylistic and symbolic behaviour, including fashion, behaviour and their own slang.
One of the most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use as an example the few unfortunate children who were left without adult socialization as a result of either neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse.
Some children have been isolated by humans (often their own parents), and in some cases the rejection has been due to the parent's abandonment of the child because of a serious intellectual or physical disability.
The children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are said to be domesticated animals, some said to live in their own nature.
If a wild child has been raised entirely by an animal other than man, he will behave (within his physical limitations) almost exactly as his foster animal, for example, by showing a similar fear or indifference toward humans.
The aim of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting, and scaffolding goes a step further.
Ladders are not a learning method but a tool to support individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of stick, but so is the little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual ladders are built into the software and are intended to ask questions, give suggestions and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to follow without help.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but some do live.
We're keeping the foster care system as a safe haven for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a level playing field, and reliable health care.
The aim of the children's placement is to meet all the basic conditions they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and human communication.
The specific features of the Internet imply additional dimensions in the case of the use-by-use theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are presented as important influences on Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new influencers' perspectives when studying public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-images, or facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been argued that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge honesty.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
20th century research has shown that there are two types of genetic modification: hidden and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, selection removes it from the store of variation that has been expressed.
With each generation, decomposition and recombination move back and forth between these two stocks.
A hand-held animal with a digestive system similar to that of humans has difficulty getting enough amino acids from plants available on the savanna.
Furthermore, lack of them has serious consequences - stunting, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The easiest plant resources available would have been the proteins from the leaves and peas, but for a handful of us, they are difficult to digest without ripening.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digestible and provide a rich supply of all the essential amino acids.
So we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption means intentionally waking during normal sleep and falling back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes later).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, which restores consciousness but does not fully awaken.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force, and it is possible for all to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacle to that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was supplemented by the concept of the mahajana, or great path, and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, and visualizing deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, so the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war really took place, with proxies fighting on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defenses were broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans were dashed almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers marched into the country and established the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after attacking eastern Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their own country maintains its ability to move its own people and goods while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, mostly using submarines, tried to prevent this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
The goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and wool.
Generally, goats were raised in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of shepherds, often children or adolescents, such as the more familiar shepherds, and these methods of shepherding are still used today.
Carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted of only parallel wooden beams, they enabled the horses to pull the wagons faster and with greater loads than on the slightly uneven roads of the time.
Rail bolts were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place, but gradually it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they were overlaid with iron rail.
The practice became common, but the iron consumed more wooden wheels than the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first full-iron railways were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus evolved.
The Australopithecus before it did not walk upright as consistently.
Specialization in bipedalism is found in fossils of Australopithecus 4.2 to 3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we should find the root causes of the problems and eliminate them.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of human progress in science and technology, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and humanity's wasteful way of life.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies of what are now known as Dunlap's Open Sheets were printed.
John Nixon read the document out loud for the first time in public on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap open-ended sheets known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot of stuff in birds that still looks scary.
They have legs with fins and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrantosaurs.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of data encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers  or bits in the professional language of computer circuits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and vomiting-like symptoms are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of internal poisoning is a visible, open medicine jar or container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the label for first aid instructions for the poison in question.
Entomologists refer to this particular group of insects as "lutes".
The term comes from the fact that in ancient times, bedbugs were very common, and bedbugs are insects that are well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the beetle and the caterpillar are nest vipers, adapted to live in the nest or shell of their host.
With some 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in the United States, it is the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The study has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can, if they wish, make an adoption plan for their young child.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, allowing the other couple to act as the child's parent.
The main task of science is to find out by scientific methods how the world works, and the scientific method guides most of scientific research.
However, it is not just about doing experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek language became less well-known in the West, it lost its connection with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in body structure and behavior often depend very substantially on the existence of innate cycles and their generation by means of biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to circulate freely for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's study was one of the most important indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments either by marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or by radioactive breaking the phage protein.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, how important the gene part is affected, and whether it affects the germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to the offspring, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the scenery  including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park tours and exploring the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, learning about, and photographing the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, residents of small rural towns drive to work, and they are met by others whose jobs are where they left off.
In such a dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that the vast carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, we rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they cheat every day, are the traffic planners just incompetent, or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow, as drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively uniform manner, so traffic flows are usually moderately consistent and can be represented in a rough mathematical way.
In order to better describe the traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in planning, planning and maintaining the road.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and to find food and companions more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward against their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the sunbird and the sunbird are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire Solar System moves around the earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, with more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at six miles wide.
The full 20 percent of the water that flows into the ocean on our planet comes from the Amazon.
The actual Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction of the pyramids of Giza was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City State is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest by population.
The Vatican State uses the Italian language in its legislation and in its official communications.
Most government workers speak Italian as their mother tongue, but Latin is often used in religious services.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican State are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, humans have known common chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they all occur in nature in their own right and because they are also relatively easy to extract with elemental tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a combination of one or more elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four forms of matter - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma - in the same order, but he also theorized that they would be transformed into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are basically alloys of two or more metals.
The elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that they would fit into the trillions of the final point of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came to the market.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have developed, the value and purpose of the pencil have been left in the dust.
Today, messages are typed on a computer screen, and the sharpener never needs to be sharpened.
You can only guess what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus, which is made up of many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, but if you split the core again, you release some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which makes them prone to breakdown under little or no thrust.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The moon's crust is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) thick on the visible side of the Earth and about 100 kilometers (62 miles) thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker up in the air.
The dark areas of the sea may be more visible on the visible side because the crust is thinner, and the slab was easier to lift to the surface.
Content theory is primarily concerned with what is behind people's behavior or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as adults.
These theories look at why some people want what they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders start to lead their former peers, two different patterns of behavior can generally form: At the other end of the scale is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or "the guys").
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, sharing responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the individual is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
This often leads to disagreements between the managers and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to be of the same quality as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
The virtual team members act as contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones and their local administration may not always understand this.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique elements of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which all members report, and an invisible team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in all the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be created.
As a result, a process where the organisation works together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuity approach as a methodology used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, which narrows the field of study and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behaviour and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The proliferation of new technologies makes it possible to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is thought to be closely related to science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
In AI research, we're trying to get machines to automate tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and hand, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology and defence, as well as being embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
Class trips are an important part of teaching, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution, virtual classroom tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art from their desks.
Sharing a class trip virtually is a great way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year the students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital, and the site is updated annually, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of playbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills.In the early stages of the student blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often neglected, but the presence of the audience usually changes things.
Since students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to struggle to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them". The need to feed the interest of the readership inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can allow students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings and bring their own perspective to the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north, among others, the pristine, scenic Muskoka.
These and many other factors make Ontario a place of impression, which outsiders regard as Canada's epitome.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison may surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and by nature the largest of the continents.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France, and they are known as luxury beach destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it had much influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women  All female travellers, regardless of their actual civil status, are encouraged to state that they are married.
Also, wearing a ring helps (as long as it doesn't look too valuable.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment, and it's not uncommon for someone to follow, grab their arm, and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to take sides (cultural differences do not justify a rapprochement!).
Founded in the tenth century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen, the modern city of Casablanca was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping spots in Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of bookbindings, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, burying most of its streets, especially in the city center, in the ground.
Goma is reasonably safe, but any excursions outside the city require preliminary investigations to determine the current state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, where you will find Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla trackers.
The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short drive.
Combined with its relatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination and an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990 because of the threat posed by sand in the desert.
It was one of the main stops on the Henry Louis Gates PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different nature areas, each supporting a different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a daily protection and entrance fee, as in all South African national parks.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives you access to either part of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong area and is a major destination for many tourists.
The contours of the buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong have been compared to the shimmering column pattern that is best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best part of Hong Kong is seen by leaving the island and heading to the opposite Kowloon harbor area.
Much of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is located on a flat-built landfill on the northern shore.
This is the exact place that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for clues to the colonial history of the area, it's a good place to start.
Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian part of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangroves; they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Indian tigers and some 30,000 hawksbill deer.
Buses leave from the Inter-county Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially eastbound to Jakari and Bumthang, leave between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
Since the buses within the area are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Small Japanese Coasters, which are comfortable and supportive, run through most counties.
Kimpa taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paroon (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a left-hand bridge that crosses the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 232 feet [83 m], are 1,378 feet [378 m] long, and have two strips of three-and-a-half-foot [3.5 m] plates.
The bridge has a sub-traffic height of 15 metres and construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian border stations are estimated to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important of the indigenous groups in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-pastoral hunters but also engaged in self-sufficient agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes, such as the guaycur√∫t and payagu√°t, lived in the Chaco area, and they supported themselves by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Kingdom of the Indies", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples of the country.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Las Ca√±itas half-course.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
The Argentine Polo Federation is getting news about the tournaments and the places to buy polo tickets.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands that can change money is the one in Stanley, across from FIC West.
British pounds are the main currency in all islands, and Stanley is also frequently used for credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to work in the outer islands, although British and US currencies may be available.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands themselves, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer while the northern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, and temperatures in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30¬∞C] are common during the summer months.
Winter can be a treacherous time: temperatures rarely drop to the freezing point, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder on a thermometer.
There are no special rainy seasons or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall stays almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you stay at least 100 yards per meter away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards per meter away from other wildlife.
Bison, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, even though they may look very tame.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, considering that the scents attract bears and other wildlife, avoid bringing in or preparing foods with strong odors, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Established in the 1850's, Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port experienced a notorious naval dispute in 1889, when seven ships - German, American and British - refused to leave.
All but one British cruiser sank, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the death of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches because Auckland is located between two ports, and the most popular ones are in three different areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are on the Pacific coast and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the port of Waitemata, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family homes, and the coastline is lined with a good selection of shops.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It's not a multi-dimensional beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing.
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better preserved on the way.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find for those who are careful.
The idea of flat white milk coffee is new to Australians. A small black coffee known as an espresso, and a cappuccino served with a large amount of cream instead of skimmed milk. Tea is served without milk.
The cocoa is of Belgian quality, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many excursions to the reef throughout the year, and injuries to reefs for any of these reasons are rare.
So heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The polar medusae are found on the northern side of the 1770s along the beaches and in the river beds from October to April, and occasionally they can be seen elsewhere.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and will probably swim away.
The shell-shaped crocodiles do not actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is the riverbanks north of Rockhampton.
By making an advance reservation, the traveler can have peace of mind that when he reaches his destination, he will have a place to sleep.
Travel agencies often offer special hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transport arrangements and even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, all changes and requests should be directed first through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to camp in the area and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you need to arrive on time to get the music close to the campsite.
Remember that even after the main stage music performances, there may be venues at festivals where music continues to play late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice makes a very terrible noise in the worst parts.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city, cruise travellers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos typically do their best to maximize the time and money spent by customers, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood  and in the casino.
Some places serve alcoholic beverages at the top of the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or in mountainous areas should consider the possibility of snow, ice or extremely cold temperatures.
The roads are not too crowded on ice and snow, and you cannot drive in the same way as you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, it can snow so much in a very short time that a car gets stuck.
Snow or wind-blown snow, as well as moisture or ice accumulated in the windows of the vehicle, may also impair visibility.
On the other hand, freezing and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is generally uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps Africa's biggest attraction and for many a highlight of their visit.
In the native language, the word safari refers to a journey by road to see the magnificent fauna of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and ordinary equipment is good enough to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A bush safari (also called bushwalking, hiking safari, and hiking) is a form of hiking that can last for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation practices vary, but given the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-based cancellation practices did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were due to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost ¬•2 500130 000 whereas tickets normally cost around ¬•7 000.
Wetting wet clothes can help dry them out, and many hotels offer a brush and board, even if they are not in the room.
If ironing is not available or if you do not particularly care about ironing socks, you may want to try a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as this may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, frostbite).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have doubts, consider buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not accustomed to in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poisons, and transmit disease.
Actual infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually considered pests.
Tax-free purchases are the possibility to purchase products exempt from excise and sales taxes in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries may sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging on the Buffalo/Pittsburgh motorways, as it frequently passes through remote woodland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: there are many steep climbs and descents, narrow lanes, and steep bumps.
The speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections  generally 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and their absolute compliance is even more important than usual.
Strangely, mobile phone reception is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness area.
German pastries are quite good, and Bavarian ones are quite rich and varied, reminiscent of the pastries of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, apple cakes are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and the popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but solid pastries, try one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a staple that covers a wide range of regional culinary cultures across the country.
But when used without further definitions, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the island, and includes a large variety of simply seasoned dishes.Javanese favorites include peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The pedals are the rider's footprints, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but they may be associated with safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse's back but his foot gets caught in the tread, the escaping horse may pull him back, and various precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear high-heeled riding boots with a smooth, rather narrow base.

Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many skiers, sometimes called "ski booms", plan entire vacations at a particular destination around the ski.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Backpacking: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, cross-country skiing or cross-country skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it is not usually included because the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer strides and monos.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you can go a little faster than on foot, but you rarely reach the speed of skiing on well-groomed boards and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries.
The Schengen area, however, acts somewhat like a single state in this respect.

Traditionally, however, not all S√°mi people have engaged in large-scale reindeer farming, but have lived by fishing, hunting and other similar means of subsistence, and have kept reindeer as their main source of livelihood.
Today, many S√°mi people work in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in the Saamenland.

The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not be expected to survive security scans while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Backflow is the return of waves breaking the shore, often found on reefs or similar places.
Because of the underwater formations, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, where a rapid flow into deep water can occur.

The island is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island, home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled crater of a still-active volcano serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea in the south of the peninsula.
There the Nijmegen Mountains merge into the plain and then rise again to form the 200-mile-long (360 km) Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the glacier of Minnesota.
In the north, the Sentinel Mountains are home to the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson, at 4,892 meters (14,950 feet).
In remote areas where mobile phones are not available, satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, since to make a call you have to be outside and have unobstructed satellite visibility.

Finland is an excellent destination for boating, and the land of thousands of lakes also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal islands.
In islands and lakes, you may not need a boat the size of a bite.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a popular leisure activity in Finland, with boats for every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise very rare (e.g. one in 40 in the Netherlands).
Most actual Baltic Sea cruises involve a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and still return to the ship for the night to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa if you are only visiting the country on a boat tour (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced anything traumatic.
There is no reason to be ashamed of it: it is not different from the fears and disgust many other people have for certain other things.
For some, some understanding of how the plane operates and what happens during flight may help to overcome fear of ignorance or helplessness.
Transport companies are well paid for fast deliveries, and speed is often very important for company documents, merchandise or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they were shipping goods by air freight, it could take days to unload and clear the cargo on some routes.

The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large bill of money for this privilege (or perhaps you'd rather have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: according to a strict boxing rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of business class compared to tourist class and eleven times the price of first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it is generally not even worthwhile to look for discounts on business or first class seats.

The Parisian rude exterior will fade quickly if you show a very ordinary compliment.
Plitvice National Park is rich in forest, mostly pine, fir, and fir, and its vegetation is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
The vast variety of plant communities is due to the diversity of microclimates, the varying soil and the differences in altitude.
