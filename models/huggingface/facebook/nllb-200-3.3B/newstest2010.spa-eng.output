Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth US president in history.
The diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be given to them, among other things, for their outstanding efforts in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee which, in October, elected him among 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple are then scheduled to meet King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, though the third to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, he will speak about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this subject, knowing that he is receiving the award as the president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts were further increased with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which not forgetting to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the cheque of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
He's proposing to donate them to charity, but he hasn't decided yet to which organization.
During the entire programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the award.
He mentioned, for example, feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also said that the prize was not just for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
The president of the civil society association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Society of Defenders of the Nature Litoměřice) was accused of blackmail by the police in Litoměřice.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction permit granting procedures and to withdraw appeals demanded from investors money for his own benefit, said the spokeswoman of the Litoměřice police Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Defenders Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the trash cans much.
In Prague, citizens can sort out the drinks packaging and in the villages of South Moravia, you can find containers to sort out garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
It takes them several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, for being the second largest city in the Republic, the city councils are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of waste, not only because of the fact that we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle into the right container in the middle?
It's almost impossible, especially since it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is on Moravské náměstí square, opposite Potrefená Huse.
Don't be mad at me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that's too little.
Needless to say, other places are not easy to separate.
That's why a lot of my friends prefer not to break up with her.
For the sake of laziness
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, I found the right place on the tram.
However, the trash was already overflowing from the bin.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
The socialists in Brno do not seem to be very interested in ecology and aesthetics.
They prefer to buy the extra hockey league from the city, which is a disgrace to the whole republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials to make Brno cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet for a while, with the official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst city in the entire region of the Jihomoravsky Kraj.
The "Paroubek" budget took money from the rents and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rent, sickness allowances or building savings.
But not for the interests of the national debt or international litigation.
This will hurt all those who govern in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they relied on the government to ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, rent or sickness allowances. "That only means postponing problems for the future, it is laying mines", says Janota.
The fact is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and eventually you have to pay the money back.
The state doesn't have much of a choice in getting money.
If you don't reduce social welfare or government operating expenses, you have to raise taxes.
All those who have been added by the left now: the firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
People don't have to worry about their income or their sickness benefits, they'll get them.
But the price to pay will be an increase in public debt; next year the treasury will not only lack 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to rise along with interest expense.
The state will need money to cover them and it will no longer come with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity benefits, as the government did in its deficit package.
Because of the dislocation of money to benefit some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion short of completing the construction of highways and railways.
This applies in particular to sectors for which the tender has already been issued and where the construction process has already begun, and whose projects cannot be changed or reduced in price.
The best you can do is to keep them, which is not free either.
That means delaying or stopping the thirty large construction projects; the possibility of getting European funds is also at risk, warns the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution to the decline in funds: it would get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is majority-owned by the State, and add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never certain nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year the dividends are used to offset ecological damage, to supplement the income account or to serve as a reserve for the planned income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The money-making carnival doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion was obtained from the budget to grant various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including savings in construction.
It's not clear if the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international case, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Then the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, take advantage of the reserve of the government budget.
There is also a 100 million shortfall for the 2 billion dollar project of the State Treasury, which has already been started and should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister doesn't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to run on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between various operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With the press of a button, they can go from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
This possibility is precisely the objective of the American company VMware, which concentrates mainly on the development of computer virtualization software.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
You can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be released in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware is working with European and American carriers to test the virtualization of smartphones, and these phones will be available to customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries the hotel owners.
It's not just ski-keepers in the Krkonoše who are concerned about the snowless slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors to our pages.
People look at the deals, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud", mentioned the maintainer of the news portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn as they expected, should not hesitate to book the room.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in the second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel owners in Špindlerův Mlýn mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll keep offering them, but soon they'll give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell out quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we're most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half the seats are still open.
That is why we have already prepared some last minute holiday accommodation", said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also very well sold, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is impaired by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if it's going to snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year on a mountain without snow.
If the slopes remain snowed during the week, the Christmas dates will also be exhausted,' says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a bit easier to occupy the rooms at the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last available seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February and it also sells well", reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the rooms for New Year's Eve are already occupied also at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the newest hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at about 60% of capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the manager of the Omnia hotel.
However, it seems that the hotel owners in Krkonoše will soon get over the craving for snow.
Thursday's temperatures should drop, and if there's precipitation, the mountains should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, from the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.A.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, like a diligent student repeats the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, whom he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan approach, it turned out to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase "just like in Iraq" used several times in the same text, but he also used the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new way forward".
It was he himself who three years ago criticised Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from the civil war, and he called it "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
The next few months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no mention of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favorable starting position than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
Field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, most notably the Afghan operation commander-in-chief General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relationships, subjected the undecided gunners in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to help him.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he fooled the general about 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had previously counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this process in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the Iraq procedure.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is being honoured.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to change the chief every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, though formally established, will remain only a Potemkin people.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to the confusing relationships, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even setting a state that is "action-ready", a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by his willingness.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now on the verge of exploding.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to war to "return home soon", will work some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and they do not want to explain to their electors, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war on the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, which could radically affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
The answers will have to be sought precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic turnaround for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential elections are three years away and that is why there is still a lot of time to find another strategy, if this one proves a total failure.
The executives of Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash bonuses
The top executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs has become the leader in the effort to link Wall Street bonuses with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road it must take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after setting aside almost $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, 20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax bankers bonuses over £25,000 (about CZK 712,000) at a flat rate of 50 percent.
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except physics.
Five women, a record number, were awarded this year's Nobel Prizes in Stockholm by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, in specialised categories and in literature.
In addition to the four women scientists, the winners included a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and to their compatriot Jack Szostak for their work on chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for their explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was given to American economist Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category without a female winner was Physics.
The prize was awarded to Charles Kao for his research into optical cables, and to George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and telescopes.
Each laureate received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to SEK 10 million (approximately SEK 25 million).
In the event of several winners in each category, the prize shall be shared among them.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
The Commission is also proposing that the Commission should be able to take account of the economic situation of the countries of the region.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is considering his permanence in the government, since he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota's continued cabinet, are supposed to be the issues at their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was reported by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to talk to Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his continuing to hold the post.
The budget law, which Klaus is preparing to sign, says that the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left's proposals for fund transfers and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the Social Democrats' proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed on in the spring by the SDG, the CSSD and the Green Party, became controversial because of this conflict.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of austerity measures, imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had been neglecting "the serious problem" for a long time, that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to carcinogens.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS vice-president Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of a bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted by calling similar words "strong sentences".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were happy too.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggles and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, who is 91, asked him to play him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When you interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, played the leader of the abolition movement, who ended up being a slave, the fictional president of the United States, and even God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely portrayed someone who is still alive and, for many people, as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong to the world's extent to the outsiders.
The South African team reaches the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story into theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Naturally, the greatest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
Most importantly, I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that when I shake your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the film I look much taller".
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is also talked about ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film".
In the movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 percent positive rating.
The secret of the splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry finally acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The Bulava-type missile, once destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is now becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, didn't fly off or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write about "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but it glows.
During this, the 13th test, no problems were encountered at first.
At the end of the flight, the aircraft again experienced technical problems.
The engine probably exploded on the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a moving vessel that is both submerged and underwater.
So it's likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegians didn't hesitate from the start that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that one cannot simply talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile held up and the failure occurred in the third.
In the above cases the engines failed immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defense's management only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and that's why they keep stating that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed at the age of 51 an annual contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov will be returning to a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play in Friday's KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to sort out some formal matters, quoted the AP agency Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear if the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice rink, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five players group Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, won the Canada Cup, and the world junior championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Hall of Fame of hockey.
Hyundai has met the union's demands and will cancel all overtime.
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime work.
Because of the frequent overtime, the unions declared a strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman of the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions for an extra Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential, so we proposed voluntary extra work for Saturday, December 19, i.e. work in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way of motivating its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can claim the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive travel and food money.
Because the overtime was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped the manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two hours more in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation persisted almost every day until last week.
After the agreement is signed the unions will cancel the emergency strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they commit to comply with the requirements and the document is signed, they are ready to cancel the emergency strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for the frequent overtime work.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and the alleged harassment.
The management felt that the employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and to be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency strike of Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, were penalized in any way.
As far as overtime is concerned, the unions demand that the company keep it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they demand for this work a remuneration of 5,000 crowns.
The automobile factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial production was started last November.
Until last September it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: a substance effective even in 'cold' HIV viruses
Czech and German scientists test new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective on a common variant of the virus as some medicines already available.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, patients' lives may be significantly prolonged by a combination of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from replicating in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs will no longer work.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University demonstrates the possibility of mastering virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metallocarbons have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that is different from all the drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, 'improved' compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus albumin.
Metal-carbonates have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fractionation of HIV and no mature and infectious virus corpuscles would be created.
If HIV protease is stopped, the virus will also stop spreading in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still being modified systematically.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test for the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out in test tubes, and also against its resistant variants obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarbons interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, said the budget approved for next year was "horrible" and that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were noted by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time left for analysis.
ODS vice president Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously doesn't work anymore.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the chamber of deputies, which is trying to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, albeit with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for state officials' salaries, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should be running a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS left the Chamber before the vote and thus fulfilled the wish of the government that the amended budget was better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and Uselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disillusionment and a feeling of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened with resignation in case of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He noted, he's thinking about staying on the show.
The reason is their disillusionment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees to another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do the nominees by the ČSSD, which imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly state whether he will resign if the House passes other bills that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness subsidies, pensions, or the amendment of the service bill.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDO are not to blame
It's the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenant there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decided to resign the principle of fighting the height of the public deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that he lean on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, he cannot count on the support and tolerance of the ODS members.
I have not thought about it, when the time is right, I will deal with it, said the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of ODS, to journalists in the Chamber of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer left this afternoon for a European Council meeting in Brussels.
ODS ceded at the Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask the ODS deputies to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he said, responding to the question whether ODS is not concerned about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it would be mainly about the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of ČD, fewer trains will run for almost the same fares
České dráhy (Czech Railways) will from 13 December cancel or restrict some fast and local trains that are less used and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
Total traffic length will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train timetable comes into effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More links to the capital will be provided for the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, for example, and a pendulum railway will be added to this line.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not run to Bratislava again.
On the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line fewer fast trains will run, and direct links between Prague and Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by drach is in the Hradec Králové region, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line will also be cancelled and some high-speed trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only some weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Praga Hlavní nádraží station.
The Czech Republic has also introduced new SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will no longer be allowed to travel to Bratislava on Pendolino.
The bill for regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The high-speed trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses, the Dráhy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast and local trains, they have a new contract for ten years, until now the contract was always for one year.
The Drhyas are happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't raise the prices of a large majority of tickets.
The changes will only be made to the one-day tickets - ČD Net and the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was a single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Filipino gunmen still detain more than 50 people, children were released
Gunmen have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP news agency, which previously reported only about 65 abductees.
All 17 children and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say about 19 armed men are using the hostages as human shields in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which was caused by the settlement of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was imposed because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
For the suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood, Invictus (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), will be released in US cinemas, which captures a part of the biography of the former President of the Republic of South Africa Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago for the leading role by Mandela himself.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, the reactions of the critics and the audience were born.
The President
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The report, which is being published in the Official Journal of the European Union, is a welcome step towards the end of the current year, as the preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are reaching their peak.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film at RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says, he's proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well for it.
I met Nelson Mandela in person many times, to - as they say - recharge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember the character and the message of Mandela.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it is a story of the whole world, he added.
In the national rugby team uniform
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the loosely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the South African national rugby team suit and enters the field of play. RSA won the world cup at that time.
By entering the grille in the suit, which in RSA is considered as something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great applause, especially from the white audience and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The soccer championship may succeed in helping people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation at the RSA improves.
White South Africans are however skeptical, as for example rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain, said in a recent interview for LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns is burned
The fire has caught in the morning a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman of the firefighters of the Ústí region, the fire is being extinguished by six groups.
The firefighters had previously intended to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is being extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, a short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokeswoman, and the breakdown does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, so it won't be possible to count it exactly before the fire is put out.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokesperson for ČEZ for the Northern Czech Republic, the electricity supply was not cut off, and the fire at the substation did not affect the operation of households, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps operated in the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduit.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains electrical conduction for 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander to three Hetman of ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura today filed a complaint for slander against three social democratic leaders.
The Commission has also received information from the Polish authorities that the Polish authorities have not yet received any information on the identity of the person who was the subject of the complaint.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radio News.
The demand is related to the company's effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisin from the cake", yet we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards the Student Agency society, he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
The Commission is also proposing that the Council of Ministers should be able to take a decision on the issue of the new directive, which would be a new legal instrument for the European Union.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint to be a continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and himself.
I am naturally prepared to defend my good name and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do the same.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the transport of dangerous goods by rail.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, aimed at warning of these measures of the regions.
He told Radio Journal that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a tender.
Jančura said similar steps were in breach of the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a ČSSD deputy, I know, which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, said Jančura today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine, it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are coming to a head.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for the vaccines, which will be covered by the insurance companies.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born after 2 August of last year will be able to receive the pneumococal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine should be given between the third and fifth month of life.
Last year a quarter of families voluntarily stopped vaccinating their children against pneumocytes.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Vaccinating younger children requires four doses.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
But you'll save on the treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent for all the vaccination of children about 500 thousand annually.
The covert vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Every year 28 children under the age of 10 die from pneumococcal infections in our country, according to research in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, there are also some opinions that this vaccine could be made mandatory in the future.
Starting in January, it's covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
Mandatory vaccination would be better, said for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have achieved at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococosis.
At the moment we do not think so at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová admits that the voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, there would be reason to reduce the number of doses. "In the situation where the vaccine costs so much, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as voluntary", says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that by next year more than 80 percent of young parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococci.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change too because as the first vaccination in children is covered by the health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs were however afraid that insurance companies might "take the money out of health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait, until they're paid for by insurance companies.
It's estimated that pediatricians will be spending $40,000 a month on vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will not be easy, Cabrnochová says.
The son of an American artist involved "in a museum robbery"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania State Police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and his trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP reported that an unnamed police official claimed a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta Jr., 52, told police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a depot".
The agency said that Frazetta Sr. denied having granted such permission.
Labour defends tax increases in budget
Ministers have defended tax hikes and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister also received harsh criticism for harming low and middle income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Angry about Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems".
The rise in Social Security spending, which will grow to around three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, who say this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
The Commission has also proposed to the Council that the budget should be increased to ECU 1 billion.
Social Security with an additional 0,5% increase, from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New tax of 50% on the bonds of bankers
The one-point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%.
According to estimates from the Treasury, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 a year and a person earning £40,000 will lose £190, while a person earning £10,000 a year will earn £110.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on the 5% of the highest paid.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers, and it will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again towards the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit will be reduced, have been called into question after the Minister of Finance was forced to alter the early figures.
In his statement, he claimed that the economy would probably contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be £3 billion above what was previously estimated.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party's "debt crisis", said the projection of borrowing for £789 billion over the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, cynically dodging difficult options until after the elections due to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything meaningful about what they will do", said Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and they have squandered it".
"All the big announcements will be made after the elections, whoever wins"
The Commission has also received a number of complaints from the Member States.
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, as opposed to the Conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised from tax hikes and spending cuts would be used to support next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sand castles".
The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the ads, as well as the inflation of some disability benefits next April, mentioned above, would leave the Treasury Secretary open to accusations of electoral manipulation, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is being provided to people who need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
'False budget' is a common misnomer.
Although ministers did not release the post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the tightening of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the figures from the Minister of Finance implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
"This is really postponing the pain for later", said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the big announcements will come after the election, win whoever wins", added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was the fake pre-budget report. The markets are aware of this".
FBI investigates the "arrest of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it's investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the US state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information on the men.
Three of them are reportedly of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are going to be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being detained", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing", the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sights of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported them missing in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses" by the government
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have been consistently poor, according to a report by campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details the regime's "abuse patterns" before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man cited in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political foundation.
The thousands of people arrested and the dozens killed in Iran after the election by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession" is a lie.
Amnesty International cited the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election result.
"They often hit me in the face", he says.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened with execution and humiliated".
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 others for over eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a race track.
The track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-meter-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the runway, but it was quite frightening.
Below is a beautiful view of the city lights flicker.
Here you'll find some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent", he added.
Prizes were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread alarm about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and thoroughly argued study of an issue that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious outlook.
As a good anthropologist, she wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France's 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who plays back debates between teachers and students on the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them of any repute, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They can't get this argument out in full.
The conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives an adjustment of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world's most bleak picture
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, transportation and fishing interests have focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
A master of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who gave proof of courage in the face of the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a valiant 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The cubs, caught swimming alongside the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, featured 75 polar bears at once.
Even today, the enclosures of zoos are still generally one millionth the area of an adult wild animal's enclosure. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the United States, and Russia, slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile Eskimos use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a chilling look at how the future of the Arctic can be transformed.
It's not like scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rate of change.
It's not for lack of effort.
The pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the movement of ice masses.
Then Cold War submarines mapped the shifting ice strands that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite surveys and extensive iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped out in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by sprays of saline water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders inside, they're all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is thought to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... these could be us .
Marines among the 6,000 who lay wreaths at Arlington's graves
Nineteen-year-old PFC De'Angelo Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he'd never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where they're shipping us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veterans' graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what has already been an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year, stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at the graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated over $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career military man.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving a return to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked across the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older World War I, World War II, and Vietnam war graves because they don't get as many visitors as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyous as children played and couples held hands, as they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red lace tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People openly cried, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the freezing air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others stooped to see small black and white plaques placed inside the wet mud, for those whose headstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped away tears from their eyes at the grave of their son.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember me".
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was distributing cellphones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including minor protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has applied on several occasions for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to spark tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, like handing out free cell phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch organization, which recently published a hard-hitting report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Same Cuba", a reference to the emplacement of Raúl Castro as the country's leader, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and jailed in a day.
He said any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries are starting to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday neutralized the suspected mastermind of a plot to send five North Virginian men to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hope the case can help unravel a sprawling network of terrorist recruiters, who scour the Internet in search of radicalized youths.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving of terrorist attacks on the video-sharing website YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar location for al Qaeda and their terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah failed to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
They were therefore rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men did not hesitate and were even trying to get the proper approval to access the al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the 9/11 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as sentries, not letting in those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking particularly hard at aspiring American recruits.
But they represent a huge attraction for the organization, because of their potential to gain access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit to, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become adept at their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It's become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate "action" by the government
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here demanding negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center take bolder climate action.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a cluster of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city holding banners reading "There is no planet B" in English and one in Spanish that declared, "The Earth says "enough is enough".
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to Peru, her mother's native country, made her aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening".
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the big rally, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists in sports masks and black outfits planted several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal, which is near several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest didn't seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation".
Then he continued in Mandarin, "Because the meeting place is so big, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He said it was up to each individual's perspective to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or other people's freedom.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences between the two groups.
Last week's federal grade book on math performance was very good news for the Capital District public schools.
Although the district is still far from the best-performing systems in the country, the report card showed that fourth and eighth graders strolled at a faster pace over the past two years, relative to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent disparity in performance between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth graders in D.C. over the past two years rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the yield gap grew from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-Americans through eighth grade remained essentially flat, dropping one statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is not any more encouraging.
The gap between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first district ENPE was introduced, was 60 points on the 262 to 202 scale.
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference has narrowed to 58.
Some education advocates in the District expressed concern last week that the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven in large part by white students, who are already very good students.
"This would suggest that we have improved the whole by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting", said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I'm not jumping for joy over a two-point, three-point difference", said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (D-A-R), who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the worry is that we are not devoting the time and energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the district needs to keep finding better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper-school students in the elementary and middle school who did not master the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Math, a kindergarten through sixth grade math curriculum that emphasizes real-life games and experiences, was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to provide the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to close the gap.
Here's a kind of a tough dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional politics is to direct their resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the target may generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she's trying to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on making sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they live, have confidence that their children can access a great public education.
Janey, now superintendent of the Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year on a year of 185 days, which she sees as an "indicator" to seek a bigger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more
The tour bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a loud buzz.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, came down and blinked for a moment at the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald lawns.
Graciela's parents had just graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Yet, when she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
"Gee, seriously?" she said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the school's low teacher-student ratio.
Penn State was the seventh that the kids had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States to Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who are accessing the college education they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, say the researchers, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the nation's workforce.
Those who analyze the highest achievers say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of other kids like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than 300 million dollars a year to local school systems to run college preparatory programs, which start when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have walked away having bid on only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who put in an offer lost.
Two American companies reached deals for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asians and Europeans are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It's gonna be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only US companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have forged ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation bid on more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Petroleum Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made bids that were then matched against the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each deposit.
Al Qaeda's chief planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
A suspected US missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, US counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died Tuesday when a pair of missiles struck his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local officials said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's illegal tribal area.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official from Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally mangled bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that a Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al Qaeda military planner, who directed the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was engaged in worldwide conspiracy, said a senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering their central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda's top leadership and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that the Somali had risen quickly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be a household name to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, his death would make Somali the second al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking operatives.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a tally from The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site claimed.
The top UN envoy in Kabul is about to resign
The top UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure that was marred by accusations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal beginning in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We have to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials to assist Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he had time to find a replacement.
What I said was that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun to look for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they've been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide's standing in Afghanistan was put to the test by his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations, but said the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "surely hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration with the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermined his ability to recruit talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to enter into talks over its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs heavily on me is that, if we've learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population at large.
He argued that it would take "a package of incentives and disincentives" "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer greatly" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with the directives of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge for peaceful purposes only.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have backed away from the tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran's toughening up with the international community over some proposals they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that it hasn't been in terms of meaningful additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions".
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve a proper, long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and co-ownership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in the United States' plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction.[citation needed] U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the chairman of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon you".
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave".
They learned their lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city's low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resource manager with an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, ill-mannered only children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division of Family Law.
The number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate future labor shortages".
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden", he claimed.
Gradually Relieved
Drafted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding a critical strain on its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
Also, many couples have had abortions based on the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they toned down many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at Peking University, said central government officials have been debating even more radical changes recently, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of guidelines detailing who would be eligible for a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
She has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unimpressive.
Disappointing Answer
While officials in a rural city outside of Shanghai claim to have seen a moderate increase in applications from couples who want a second child after the campaign launched, more urban districts show no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still only expected to reach around 165,000, slightly more than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai's Caolu municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally able to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the inadequate health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that choice would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, they're robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political one.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to taking care of each other and we don't really want to take care of each other".
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two careers, middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he argued.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategist "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old".
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has been characterized so far by defiant posturing and mutual recriminations, has captured renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that envisions ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with over 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not address how much money rich countries would give to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for the key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit to global temperature rise that policy makers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, a senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to concentrate on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by between 25 and 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries would cut theirs during the same period by between 15 and 30 percent.
Together, the countries would cut emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred the talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated conversations over the past week.
US special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary cuts by major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The US will not make a deal without major developing countries stepping up and taking action, said Stern, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top US climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the US would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States clashing over their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the world's 24 most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing over who should pay for the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional advisor on climate change for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say the talks will produce at most a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drew up a preliminary 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government can reach a deal.
Senior officials, such as India's environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister, descended from planes and rushed into the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, in order to delimit claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The utter disarray of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people come in and out of the convention center, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they believe are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed hand-in-hand rather than by mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity is building: almost all the key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 140 miles an hour from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13am on Monday, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 140 miles per hour when it passes like a bolt from Ashford, Kent, to St Pancras station in London, covering 60 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will be joined shortly by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first inter-city Javelin service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected, secluded areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the switch from airplanes and cars to railroads would reduce national carbon emissions as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears over environmental damage, can still hold back Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will hand over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times has learned.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line from London to the West Midlands will be laid within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan shall be drawn within a radius of 25 metres of a definite route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would split at or near Birmingham, with one branch running west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would go into Scotland.
'It looks like this will be the most profitable option,' said a railway employee.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open until 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains 400 meters long, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could be running every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital's space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to suit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston offers such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if he gets the job done, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave the fast lines for existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to secure a change from planes to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for a £75,000 orange grove from a Tory
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency house.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "living on 'rations'", raised his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second house in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the requests in time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members' expenditure.
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey townhouse in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The houses nearby have sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry into his previous mortgage deals.
Last month the committee cleared him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal security for a £271,406 mortgage on his London property to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was claiming approximately 1,400 pounds monthly in mortgage interest, up until March of last year.
In April, their claims rose to over £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage was unchanged at the time, suggesting that the entire increase was to fund the £75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, the rate at which it is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan was still claiming £1,250 per month in the month of May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as House opposition leader in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive "on rations" after the expenses scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like a s**t".
He stated: I spend my money on my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't".
The MP, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the pay office that this could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound symbol in Mr Duncan's lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he had been asking for £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved by both the pay office and subsequently Legg".
He added: It's not about dodging and delinquing or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the bounds, according to the rules, authorized and all.
It could not be any clearer or simpler".
Come, all you who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the Brighton Beach palapa
Brighton's palapas have found new momentum for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests able to watch the last palapa from 5.30pm to 6.30pm every day, with filled pastels and free served punch.
The selected carols so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric in the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated: "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society".
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
The idea of the Advent calendar for the palapa started as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we're trying to try and represent that through spirituality".
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters rallied Saturday for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, across the world and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change must reach by Friday at the latest.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world represented by these demonstrations contributed to the "high political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to them, they are especially members of the "Black Blocs", ultra violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, which was quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took the Bella Center, the venue for the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers, and the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most in sky-blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and for the climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: there is time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that are drying up, waterways that you can walk through like you've never been able to walk through before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organizations.
The European Parliament's José Bové, a leading figure in the anti-globalisation movement, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for a different world".
The Asia Pacific region, which includes numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, was the initial trigger for the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, marched in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters gathered to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, though Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected a president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 over control of South Ossetia, another separatist Georgian region recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 17h GMT.
According to officials of the Electoral Commission of Abkhazia, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the close.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday night.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing president Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the vote count.
This election is a sham.
Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili, for his part, "deplored that Abkhazia had fallen under the total Russian occupation", his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé, said.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict which ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is trying to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Sukhumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees in the entrance.
The issue of Russian dominance is the central issue in the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large billboards show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin at different locations in the small territory of 216,000 people.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to monitor the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for its support, and very particularly, the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, responded, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of the underground railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
You need a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets around the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, where police on alert arrested more than 700 people around a massive demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the afternoon amid the chill of the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that should come into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up for the invited speakers, and the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with bricks and hammers, reported a journalist of AFP.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened forcefully, knocking several of them to the ground.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was hit in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of some twenty people, according to police.
We are not taking our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Jakob Henriksen warned as police helicopters were flying over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most wearing sky-blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and for the climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: there is time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, streams that you can walk on like you've never been able to before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a leading anti-globalisation figure, told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
Oxfam and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to head the crowd, mobilised several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is made up of numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, was the first to give the demonstrations a start.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red and held up handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine capital's City Hall.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters gathered to demand action on climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
History and geography subject reinforced by secondary education reform, says Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview to be broadcast in the Sunday's Informative (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" by the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students in the first year of baccalaureate will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
The Minister said that "enough with the hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it calls the best students".
The branches of General Education and Literature cannot be sub-branches of C, he went on to stress: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were indignant at the fact that history and geography had been eliminated in the second year of high school in technological schools".
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disapprove of the government's plan to eliminate the compulsory teaching of history-geography in second grade. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives of the right also criticized this fact.
However, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of removing philosophy from the second year of baccalaureate C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilisation on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
At Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an entrance test that will focus on their discipline, and at the end of the year, an entrance test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also do practical work in real conditions during the M2 year, then spend a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practical work.
If you do all the practical proposals before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister said that he would propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, which challenge was accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Higher Normal School on Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace laureate, opened the "Ernest" conference wheel, a day of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of the conference, who said that the day was named after the school's fish that were baptized by the students.
We selected about 20 participants from among the experts in their field and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking without notes but with the help of graphs in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public would understand that 'the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific dossier'.
Videos filmed during these lectures will be online on the school's website starting December 15.
The next "Ernest" session is planned for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delayed payments: displeasure among prison guards, action planned
The prison guards' unions called for a 'general mobilisation' on Friday to demand payment before the end of the year, of bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The penitentiary Workers' Force (2nd guards' union) asked the off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their belongings.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "gather in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", because it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-fulfillment of payment in December of the "extra hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guards' union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase the discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the extra hours increased a lot in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
Late in the day, the Foreign Office reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards' unions guaranteeing them that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our penitentiary system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which was caused by a poor evaluation of the number of overtime hours, does not happen again in the future.
The December report will then be paid little, except for the staff of the management who benefit from the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who 'always blame budgetary demands', deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said the indignant interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding public holidays if those in October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without taking more staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's salary, believes the CGT prison of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, some are more fortunate than others.
But the outcome is not what was expected, said Ufap Secretary-General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will be celebrating his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confessed to famous TV host Oprah Winfrey that he came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I get better gifts than I get".
In a special interview that will be broadcast on ABC on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year holidays in their new prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be on his way.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I got you nice presents", she said, teasing the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before humorously replying by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devoutly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
It wasn't until many years later that I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady recalled her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of arranging them around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday has undergone another operation, RTL claims he is in a coma induced
Johnny Hallyday was re-intervened in Los Angeles due to significant "injury" stemming from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his close associates, while RTL claims that the singer was put into an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated again Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where doctors found "injuries from the operation" of a herniated disc in Paris on November 26, his press service in the same city said, indicating that the injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey calm by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical party would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be put into an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that 'according to some sources' no canula had been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic at the Parque Monceau due to a herniated disc.
The operation, scheduled for a few days ago, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic community.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection from the Delajoux surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad moment", but assured that "no problem" was being made because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me right before he was going to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to fly 12 hours after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell declared.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure by stating that Johnny Hallyday, "was responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "under control".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have been multiplying since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed he had been operated on for "colon cancer", after a mild infection.
In late September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been over-commented, fans and journalists have noticed the musician's difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Long Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday in a distance he feels particularly fond of, the 50m free, during the 2009 Euro short swim in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane baths were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when in fact many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in 4 x 50 m 4 relay styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, a mark he holds in long swimming (20.94).
In one of the two queen swims, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20'53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first at international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits which will be banned from January 1st.
The swimmers, who have set 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same event.
This time wearing the swimsuit didn't help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in the 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he won with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't really give myself to this race.
I knew I wouldn't be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola was sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola sold Thursday for $1.5 million, well above estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, seven feet by two feet high, dates from the third century A.D., and had been valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "represents four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, as there are only four or five in the world", explained Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, to AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still going on, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then it appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as part of her bathtub in her private mansion in Paris, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were unknown.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that conditions were not in place to transfer the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to its territory, to whom the coup government denied safe passage.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, declared the Mexican Minister of Foreign Relations, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the General Directorate of Migrations.
To grant him safe passage, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to present my resignation", Zelaya said Thursday to radio Globo, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for safe passage, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain a request for asylum, declared on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to the Honduran radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a report on the implementation of the new EU-wide rules on the protection of personal data.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chávez, was ousted on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare his reelection, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
The election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street is up, the US trade balance is fueling optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points to reach 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7,13 points to reach 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 extended index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) to reach 1.102.35 points.
We are getting good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he said, considering that the market was focused on "the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused on the US trade balance, "which reflects an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, in particular, exports of goods, which reflect the growth of major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, with 474,000 applications submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "was the lowest in a year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.482% from 3.423% Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of the regime boo the "Ladies in White"
Hundreds of supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday beat up the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, an AFP journalist said.
"Death to the Yankees!", "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the militants of power shouted with a fist in the air at the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the international day of human rights, were detained by plainclothes police officers, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forcibly boarded the vehicles of the dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Generally, the arrest of dissidents in such circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "call for the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissident, said one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents jailed in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opposition "mercenaries" or "agents" hired by their declared enemy, the United States.
A rare event in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of the government militants against the "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A maniac kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Highs of the Seine) on Thursday afternoon at the time of the largest influx of people.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the aggressor, 28, would have hit with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly man, in the pharmacy or in front of it in No. 85 of the boulevard Jean-Jaurès, reported police sources and witnesses.
The man, born in 1929, died in hospital after being seriously injured, according to a police union official.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, in his thirties, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims, who were seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other casualty, with his vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman fainted and was admitted "in a state of shock", a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, had escaped via the Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two other pedestrians: a man in his 30s, and another in his 40s, both seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried crossed on his back, explained at the scene a leader of the union Alliance in the Hautes-de-Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the alienated man, according to witnesses obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't succeed because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of no 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the gunman and were wounded by fists, according to police testimonies.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was an injured man in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very serious wound on his abdomen, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived, about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
The National Police arrested the man without identification papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office referred the investigation to the judicial police department of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The nut was hospitalized Thursday night.
During your pre-trial detention, you haven't said a word.
A police source doesn't rule out the possibility of an inpatient psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to subdue him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" as "every deranged fellow whose strength is considerably increased under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks to dismiss the case
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski demanded again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurred more than 30 years ago, be dismissed.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", testified before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal about gross procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
Hummel stated: "I demand that the charges be dismissed at this time, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was appalling".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (now deceased) had talked to a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before passing a sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September that he had "lied" to the documentary's author.
Hummel claimed that a trial would be held that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejected the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argumentation put forward at first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before he was sentenced for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles deputy district attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be here to appear at the hearing".
With this case, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of escape?
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor of the court, although he despises its authority".
One of the three judges, who now has 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel wasn't the only one calling for the dismissal of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded, once again, that the case be closed.
She says her client can no longer stand being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, and adds: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, pending an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses its bearings and is held back by the dollar's rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday without direction, in a market that is debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of the technological component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 extended index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points), to reach 1.106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is very quiet", said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is getting smaller and smaller and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped improve the market opinion as to the strength of the economic revival", summarized the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and were higher than expected.
In addition, US consumer confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, indices were slowed by a new rise in the dollar, which reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "leads to the downside of sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market went down.
The 10-year Treasury yield was up 3.540% against 3.482% Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond yield was up 4.497% against 4.492% the day before.
The Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World contestants are in the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this big beauty celebration organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already made their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Eruza Sasaki of Japan, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportswoman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir-up.
It was extraordinary to visit such beautiful cities as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I have seen many things and had countless experiences!" said Miss Sierra Leone in amazement.
This event, which is being held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, North of Johannesburg, on Saturday from 5 pm (15 pm GMT).
I can't think of a better country to deliver my crown.
This was a fascinating experience.
I am very happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the austral summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "breath-taking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates are focused on the pageant.
Pooja Chopra of India hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, Miss India declares with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dancing will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will be paraded in traditional dress and, of course, in a bathing suit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas will host the event.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Miss World chair Julia Morley.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visiting the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasting the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (South West) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd ever meet.
She will probably be back for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastically says Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", his son David said Friday as he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
"Dad is strong and everything is going very well", David Hallyday told reporters as he stepped off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. GMT).
The singer's son, distended, said he would be transferred "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection derived from the operation of herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been put into a coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation in Paris on November 26.
The singer was operated once again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where his daughter Jade attends, to witness a school event, a photographer for AFP confirmed.
The head of orthopedic surgery and traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer accused in a violent way to Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November 26 at the private international clinic of the Park Monceau, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
There's talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, since I had been operated twice for a herniated disc, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he said the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed following a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the courts on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and embezzlement.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" sued by the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said that the operation "went off without any problems" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause haemorrhage and therefore did not require drainage", he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been multiplying since the summer, went into a parenthesis.
No doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me, Camus declared.
UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, threatening him to withdraw it from all support, or else be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
Moreover, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As support for his management, he received the help of deputy Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claims the ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it in the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke its silence and issued a demand to the Minister and the Member of Parliament to renounce the acronym and to transfer the property rights of the trademark to them, on pain of legal action.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you would propose to your political movement to recover the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the letter's signatories maintain.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which demands that the NC remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from all media, as well as from (its) Internet site".
It also asks Hervé de Charette 'to transfer the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate right holders'.
If not, justice will be sought to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 for its membership of the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the Office continues, 'when he registered the trademark', he was no longer 'a member of the UDF for three years' but of the UMP.
It exploits the scandalous and fraudulent lack of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more dignified to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right".
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of power by a member of the public
This Friday the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist François-Marie Banier on trial to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of the octogenarian's weakness to expropriate her of a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of entertainment stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of a weakness, a crime that carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a saga-worthy trial about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are fighting for the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Court also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87, be examined by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they must state whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think he'll agree.
I will speak to her,' declared Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, as he left the courtroom.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of having taken advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, as the court considered the merits of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers's action, the lawyers' arguments sometimes turned out to be a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said that she was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: 'I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again".
The Nanterre prosecutor's office, for its part, considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so as a judge responsible for guardianship had refused, in the last few days, to give effect to her request to open proceedings for judicial protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt 'has full capacity to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place", said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the representative of the Public Ministry.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers after the trial had been held.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees adhering to "values" determined from above, as it was formerly a question of imposing on consumers products devised by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the centre of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to strategies for market conquest... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to the preference factors of the customers is regularly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all intellectual functions in the enterprise, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI "requires proactive behavior and forward-looking thinking from all parties involved"; it requires a commitment from employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a managerial revolution, which would consist in putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
The internal opinion polls have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire carried out by Orange among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid that it is not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Lastly, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioural theory that the American "neuroscience" has recently revived, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media have widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the smooth running of modern enterprises implies adopting a finalist view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating into all business management reasoning or practice a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly presented as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motifuntional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivation.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilisation factors, business managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their 'social performance' and relocate human resource management 'on the spot'.
In this way they create a favourable environment for the organised development of a strong and efficient business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama's "just war" receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against America's enemies, hailed the speech that Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited Obama's award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, a leading figure on the right wing of the Republican party, to the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the subject of "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, spent Thursday in Oslo justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives said, and he particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
"At times, the speech felt very historic", Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former congressman, who is considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear from "a left-wing president" when he reminded the Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of the George W. Bush speeches and current Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a 'citizen of the world', as he 'always does', he 'spoke like an American president' by reminding Europeans 'that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do little to preserve it', said Gerson.
Among the few on the right who weren't so convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Times, while still believing Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map for guiding international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California newspaper enthusiastically commented.
Obama "gave the speech that was needed", the New York Times said, calling it "both somber and uplifting".
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organisation that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the secretary of state for transportation, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyful" over the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators took their leave at dawn on Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement by late morning.
Even when three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by a knock on the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours, which began at 11 a.m., was necessary to get everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was fear that it would disrupt the New Year's holidays", Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4% increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly rate goes up from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low-wage workers.
It is not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants to no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some dissenters, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this was "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the protection of workers against the risks of noise pollution.
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) this is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general meetings of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of an extraordinary wage and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "under the same terms".
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies belonging to this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible", Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "business of naïves", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, Unostra lamented.
According to the Commission, the agreement puts at risk 'the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months'.
RER A: weekend clashes, unions disagree with RATP proposals
The conflicts on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue throughout the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between unions and the management of RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium demand.
For this important holiday shopping weekend, trains will only run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, at a rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four on the other lines.
The SNFC interconnection will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "the RATP is striving to serve the big shops".
The RER A crosses the city of Paris from west to east.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains ran during rush hour, and almost no trains ran during low-level hours, as had been planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Île de France.
Thus, at dawn, the station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, said he had got up "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
The new general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, and the results of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon will be discussed, which the unions say are "not very satisfactory".
The RER director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol on all aspects of RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers want, who are demanding a premium that is owed to them, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even parenteses its premium proposals, the CGT indignantly commented, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned for Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of the exercise of the profession", the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say that the company "didn't care about weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers stormed a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, which had refused to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to the RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Indépendants have submitted a pre-warning.
The unions are calling for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and are complaining about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has a million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second stage of their professional career, charge 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in premiums, for hours with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves Prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked angry protests in the Kurdish community, in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community in trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in the Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without party etiquette.
The decision follows a 2007 case brought by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes at a time when the government is reaching out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds will stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police over the past weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
The Forces of Order threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people also gathered.
After the verdict, Türk said the court's decision would "deepen the discouragement".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of matches on principle.
This is not the way to solve anything, declared Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something with which I want to make life difficult for citizens, says the director of winter road maintenance of the FES
But with it, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
The weathermen may announce it for the first time this weekend.
Over 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with the snow and ice.
In this case the ESF is acting according to a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows heavily in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below freezing, 20 of the so-called A-streets leave with large salt vehicles, explains Brauburger.
Main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the accesses for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES starts around three in the morning, "so the tracks are free until the rush hour traffic starts".
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30 a.m.
"Then we have a problem", says the winter road maintenance director, "because then no one is ready to clear the road for salted vehicles".
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is the turn of the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble starts, Brauburger knows that.
Around five in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruisers are cleared.
The FES could not normally take over the entire cycle path.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. keeps the bridges in sight, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the salt vehicle is set in motion as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call you.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a six-foot-long (2.0 m) and five-foot-tall (1.5 m) animal that ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this wouldn't have been anything special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It tells us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we've found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
During the excavation, the remains of five specimens were found.
A discovery confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found".
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared approximately 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (saurians with bird pelvis), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of air sacs, such as those also possessed by the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to air sacs, the birds' breathing is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae also the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the earliest and most primitive air-bag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also possessed air sacs and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the earliest dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lines separated at an early stage and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa hallae the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
All three cannot be descended from a single related ancestor, argue the researchers.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted picture, because in South America alone many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to be discovered.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral lineage of reptiles to the dominant land vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains a puzzle.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs spread across the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary into the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction in which the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat their opponents in the area.
Success stories don't always have a lifetime.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species that had also evolved in the Triassic and had since then led a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to São Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
The participants are professors from the Universities of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna and Berkeley, California.
The teachers involved are from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of Goethe University in Frankfurt had repercussions worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the students protesting at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike vacated last week, because the walls and artworks were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The damage, the signatories say, does not justify "the violent disbanding of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police commando".
The eviction represented "an unacceptable attack" on freedom of inquiry and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The board of directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial complaint.
Most of the occupants have caused no property damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, comments Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessen's Minister for Science, defended the action of the university rector and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Provincial Parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying the students' arguments and demands thoroughly, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, asking the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapon research.
Today, the community of 216,000, located 23 miles [37 km] from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro and nanoelectronics research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives from Selenograd have been in contact with the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
They paid several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg are signing a "Protocol of close collaboration" in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Vice-Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Mayor of Selengrad Anatoly Smirnov, with the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz signing the agreement in Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprise managers from the natural science research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relations.
FIZ companies will have the possibility to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
In exchange, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should be consulted on the draft directive on the protection of workers against the risks arising from the use of radioactive substances.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for armament research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, in which research facilities were settled.
Brakes of Stuttgart
The 21st Stuttgart Dimension is not set high enough at all.
For the project's supporters, it is simply about 'the new heart of Europe'.
The S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region into a decade of hopeless construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 grew out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which terminate in the middle of the city, were considered at the time to be 19th-century engineering fossils, acting as brakes on modern rail traffic, as formerly it took a huge amount of time to hook up the locomotives back-to-front.
Roll, stop in dry continue the journey; but this is how it should be done.
And that's why the terminals in Frankfurt and Munich had to disappear.
In Stuttgart, a transit station, the station is approximately halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the transEuropean lines, hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
S21 will really be started, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course have no further problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the newly built ICE section towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the individual large infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urbanist point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer's computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
Back then, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport by lorry.
However, the new sections under construction are not good for freight trains because of the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Over six billion euros are to be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking at other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
Sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometres of long railways across the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 the route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the gas properly.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley section will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport ruling.
The federal government is still waiting for the regional parliament in Wiesbaden to decide whether it will appeal the decision on the night flight ban from the administrative court in Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to carry out a legal investigation into the VGH's more than 400-page judgment, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The Administrative Court in Kassel had argued in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwestern runway at Frankfurt Airport, the Land would have to regulate the night flight ban again.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to appeal this ruling.
The opposition criticised this delay and pressed the government representatives to renounce the appeal before the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and FDP to honour their promises to ban night air traffic made before the elections, otherwise this could be seen as a breach of their word.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, that the federal government would be trying by misrepresentations of the law and tricks to still get their night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a while.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
As the opposition represents it, it would never have been the claims of your group about the ban on night air traffic.
U.S. banks are paying back the aid they've given.
The big American banks, shaken by the crisis, are shedding their state-owned ties.
The Bank of America repaid in one fell swoop the loans it had received from the Tarp bank rescue fund totalling 45 billion (approx. EUR 30 billion).
And the Citi group is also planning to return state aid, according to a report by the US CNBC.
With this the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised approximately 19 billion in liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the fund itself, which had sufficient funds, among others from the sale of rubrics.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult moments.
The banking house had miscalculated the absorption effort of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money on the capital market to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a well-known source that the US bank could announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick selection
In the end, everything was faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the ZDF board put pressure on editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to resign, the channel is now able to present a successor.
Last night the guild was supposed to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the main studio of ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially to avoid any anticipation of the procedure.
But surely it also influenced not to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the time of writing.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the board of directors had already indicated weeks before the election, that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another tenure of the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, that under Brender's direction the news reports of the ZDF would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flagellated.
In the end, 35 public-law experts had even meddled in the debate, calling Koch's action unconstitutional.
But it was no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Roman philology.
He later worked for the broadcaster "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, initially the informative "heute-journal".
Later posts: 1988 to 1990 personal adviser to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and presenter of the morning programme 'Morgenmagazins'; until 2001 director of foreign policy at ZDF; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the dismissal of Brender, who was elected this Wednesday as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch on the administrative board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the staff proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A retreat of political supporters from the ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move: He strongly criticized the guild for Brender's removal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a partisan henchman.
In the party calculations Frey is awarded anyway to the left-liberals.
College careers are cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally relented. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to exceed their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: basically each module of the course must end with a single examination.
The aim is to examine the workload of students and to ensure that this is a 'real and justifiable measure'.
The policy and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between universities in and outside Germany.
The Länder are committed to making the structural rules for Bachelor and Master degrees more flexible.
State regulations that deviate from this, should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have been continually talking about improving the ability to successfully complete and complete a degree (studyability).
For the first time, a specific content was discussed.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination", says a 30-page document that aims to partially regulate the approval of university courses.
The "significant reduction in the examination burden" is intended to avoid a wrong-way development, which would significantly affect the ability to study, explained the director of the accreditation council, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, 'studiability' should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be examined thoroughly for unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of subjects.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative".
These rules would apply to new races, but also to the examination of existing races.
These must be "reaccredited" again every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all careers.
The responsible for this would be 10 nationwide accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the federal states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the Länder in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Palatinate has ensured that additional means are provided for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities should implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination and foreign offices.
The federal state and the universities intend to allocate EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel university law to parliament.
According to her, one exam should be enough for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the degree should be made more flexible, and it is also intended to guarantee the recognition of evaluations in other universities and to facilitate accessibility to the Master.
The aim is to examine all the courses on their "studies" by the end of next year.
This Thursday the government and the opposition discussed again about the conditions of study in the state.
Apart from the praise, there was also criticism about the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso (Young Socialist) university groups said that the shaping of education policy should no longer be done "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as the main ones involved should be able to have an opinion as well.
The president of the university rectors' board (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW), the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union demands a legal right for every student with a Bachelor's degree to access a subsequent Master's degree.
The Federal States also have to ensure that there are enough places for the current generation of Bachelor's students to study for a Master's degree in the future, with the best possible study conditions, as stated by Mr Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW.
The Länder have to hire a lot more teachers.
But on the question of greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrolled", says the first line of a poem by the lyric poet Werner Söllner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he themes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable poetry lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
I was talking a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German Literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Along with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Attempts to recruit had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of the Securitate's attempts to provoke fear", Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as Herta Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and her literary polemic unparalleled with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors of Romanian origin are shaken by a case that shows the abysses and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and emphasised the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He had excused or defended him on all the points that were difficult for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral necessity of making this statement", he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for the spies of the Securitate-Spitzel, wrote Herta Müller in the weekly "Zeit" in July, after reading her own 914-page dossier.
The people involved must have guessed and in some cases known which names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the Stasi files review with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the control files by the Securitate is still quite vague.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the Securitate files (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then has been rather sloppy.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of the files.
An interview after Herta Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large.
"She has psychosis", they only questioned her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without a twist in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there is silent blame.
The calm reaction of the audience to Söllner's confession suggests that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the thirst for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garnish to fill your stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes Class C taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it looked as if a stylishly dressed outdoor service member was coming off a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sporting goods manufacturer had handed out samples.
The man with the bald feature had hired a driver, because he didn't know the city yet.
He could have driven the car himself, too: after all, there was no alcohol involved, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: 'It is true that we have reached the last 16' in the Champions League, thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, 'but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation.'
"The much more important task awaited them the following Sunday", he said.
Then, in Mayagherz, the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league will have to be repeated.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the quick three goals by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The Champions League round of 16 (play-offs on 16/17 and 23/24 February/play-offs on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the fulminant entry of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had in a short time inspired the bewildered Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to give and a taste for the game.
I went to the players and told them they had to focus on their strengths, urged them to be more aggressive, explained to them by the soul healer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer had any effect.
He displayed a certain magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann agreed, 'when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been believed possible.'
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury quickly rose to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "perceived with the proverbial fresh air" phenomenon and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation".
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by lack of relay and totally overwhelmed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad awakening, suggested Khedira.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still a long way off.
We're not over the problem yet.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first win at his home venue in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions made by others, and not Jens, Heldt faced the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in leadership on the board of directors, who had decided to change coaches under pressure from teenage fans.
Also that he had been removed his day off after the games qualified Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were 'marked by pure selfishness', Heldt said, and he announced the consequences for the club.
They're probably not gonna be friends forever, the two 40-year-olds.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the team of the replaced coach, the spectacle of great strength of play and battle would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important part in the success", Heldt and Lehmann said in unison, and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
Fighting for the heavyweight world championship
Burning duel in Bern: again and again the challenger Kevin Johnson was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still the heavyweight champion of the world.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version of the association beat the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Friday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was his third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had been waiting for couldn't take place.
Klitschko extended his winning streak to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to retire due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators at the Arena in Bern, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters shorter, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging again and again from the world champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively take his dangerous right hand to his target.
In general terms, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to get through the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, to endure twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already caused a scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "can't do anything".
As he weighed the weights, the champion was prompted on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose so he could see his eyes".
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained undefeated.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without fighting.
Later that year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his title defense, and in September, Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to bring all four major titles into his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Allegedly, the company that promotes him is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium, London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin  Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused the Defence Minister, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of knowingly deceiving.
In the news broadcast "Tagesschau" on Saturday, broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "had knowingly not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In a case like this, it's usually said, "He told lies".
The order to kill was given without regard to the rules of the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and which Mr Gutenberg has read, Mr Trittin said.
On Friday it was revealed that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the NATO investigation, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to address the Federal Parliament immediately and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and whether the foreign ministry, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, firmly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been overcome over the Ministry's presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it was said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the surroundings of the two high-ranking officials it transpired that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, among them a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert has written a letter asking for clarification, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far, he has not received a reply, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations, saying that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's investigation committee, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others neither see nor hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhindered indulge ourselves in the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, one who experiences dreamlike states during wakefulness, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world to be insane or a drug addict, or at least a maniac.
But such images and voices are not limited to the mentally ill or to drug addicts.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, sometimes blur the lines between dream, madness, and reality.
Dream-modified states of conscious awareness can appear in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain - mainly dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the useless, insane formations, and mirages of this".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of winged demons, with blood-red grimaces, deformed, gnashing their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he's feeling the pains all over his body.
Screaming, evil voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. rips two wires from the stereo, ties them together to form a noose, and attaches them to a hook on the roof.
You get on a horn and you put the noose around your neck.
Jump up.
The rope is loose.
What a lesson for you! shout the voices in a chorus that makes your eardrums flutter, go to the clinic and get cured!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
The cause was the LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressive, taking medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common illness after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time, sufferers can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and they fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Hearing voices is especially widespread: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the clinic of general psychiatry at the University Hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he is overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
It's usually not possible to adjust reality to them, the hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle unchanged".
The paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are supported by reality, the distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, the question of why our brain is doing things is still a mystery.
According to Fuchs, states of exception can lead to anyone temporarily losing touch with reality.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that other factors besides genes are also involved.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
Environmental influences also play an important role  stress or a traumatic experience can be the trigger for a psychosis when a predisposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere with the brain's transmission system.
When the brain gets hot
The irony of all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
Whether a hallucination is pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
These include, along with psychological disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injuries.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also experience hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are overactive or uninhibited; when our brain is heated up, but also when there's a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way that brain damage or psychosis can.
But also stimulus restriction, stress, love sickness or other exceptional brain states.
In younger studies, up to one third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
Just a girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes during recess, a clumsy boy with long, dark hair addresses her.
When she answers, the other students look at her in surprise; no one, except her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next to her.
You can even sense their presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions aren't real and they disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When in class, he sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher is introducing a new classmate to his eyes and ears, while the rest of the class is explaining mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
As he waits in the dark room for the dream to come, which often comes late and is scarce, he cannot tell whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the grimaces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs, appear before his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, I'm yelling at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents or friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
It's been a year since the hallucinations went away.
Since you've been in touch with psychologist Kasten online, you know she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while he will start to hallucinate.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it's looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of the other children as a child and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at age 13, she learned that the man she had called her father since she was of sound mind was not her biological father.
Since visual and auditory hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality.
Hallucinations are also images produced by the brain, which is why they seem so real".
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special ability.
The border between sleep and hallucination
In this overly conscious world, imaginary experiences are often pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but also involves something positive and creative. Madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated what is called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dreamlike hallucinations are almost as complex and detailed as dreams, which the person experiencing them believes to be real and which he subsequently cannot distinguish from waking.
Dream states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened with a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of one's own and imaginary that is uncoupled from reality.
A form of borderline situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world occurs, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an intolerable situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
It's all real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his dreamlike experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when his consciousness embarked on a journey of several days following a heart valve operation, including a heart transplant, while his body was condemned to immobility in the intensive care ward.
Claussen immersed himself in a world of his own making and visited strange places from other times: he found himself bedridden, an elderly man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
You see it in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the snowy Alps and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so he describes his experience.
In contrast, memories of the mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense than even real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, daydreaming, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of the outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.

The sons will take over the publishing house at 27
The new editor Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the hands of his two sons in the future, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg  Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will be actively involved in the company.
Also, if they're qualified for it.
You cannot put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would kill the kids and the company.
Mr Burda announced on Thursday that he would step down as chairman of the board of directors in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen had been appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen family member has been a member of the Burda management since 1999.
At first, I was responsible for technology.
Later, he took over the treasury and with it came responsibility for the company's assets. After Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure he also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's sons are 19 and 17 years old, and her son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to " bridge the gap of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a view to the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are not immune from decline either: 'This has always affected families who are infected by the drive to seek capital, who have judged wrongly and thought they could rise as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "delusions of grandeur", says Burda.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league; those businesses have become too big.
The beauty of the whole
Everything you could possibly want in terms of beauty and well-being is within reach.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is responsible for laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and beauty treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, where the teahouse stands out, with more than 130 different kinds of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and drinking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' who are guiding the steps of customers, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise chart.
Its director says that 15 minutes (including warm-ups and stretches) is enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to stop by the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where they offer rituals of hair restoration, luminosity or nutrition in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Varied Scouts
Christmas is coming and it's never too late to revise the looks of the stars to fit our festive wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose a very over-the-top and complicated neckline, which is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the City of Barcelona, have created the 'Oficina LIVE'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, and collect the views and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to stimulate what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to get involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CEN VERITDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of calm' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, envisaged "a horizon of tranquillity" for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the main exporting sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has launched throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotion Competitiveness Plan, we would have a situation of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants", the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector", he added.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (EUM).
The head of the Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
The Commission also stressed the need to ensure that the rules on the free movement of goods and services are applied in a way that is consistent with the principles of the Treaty.
According to the President, this plan has made it possible to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Car Show, a meeting place for professionals and motorcycle enthusiasts, will be held in Madrid.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the world of the motor.
The exhibitors will include accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures and other items.
Hundreds of items related to the world of classic motor that will delight collectors and curious.
The companies involved include Mos Clásicos and Good Old Times, which sell cars; Juan Lumbreras, which sells restaurants; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, which sells and restores cars; and Cochera Clásicos, which specialises in Mercedes Benz.
Testing of skills in the field
The commercial activities of the exhibition will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of events, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
The competition will also feature classic cars and motorcycles on a dedicated circuit outside the fair grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness and the future of the car
Mazda wants to show that sporting is not at odds with respect for the environment.
So it has just incorporated the engine stop and start system - dubbed i-Stop - into the Mazda3, a device that at least for the time being is only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good grade achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, we can see that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
Also, the feel of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the ensemble formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with lots of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style is reminiscent, in part, of the one also featured in the Honda Civic.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough room for four adults to travel in with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large, regular-shaped trunk.
The automatic engine start and stop system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-liter, 150-horsepower gasoline engine and the six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delight, distinguished by its finesse, low noise, performance and low fuel consumption.
And although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not discard this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high ride comfort, as its consumption content.
As regards the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is to say, the one incorporating a greater number of standard elements.
The standard equipment includes the lane change assistant (RVM) which eliminates the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy tires.
In addition, if it was little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive headlights bixenon and BOSE sound system with disk loader, among other elements.
The Commission
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in its class.
It stands out for the quality of the materials used, for its performance and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometers a year can opt for this version i-Stop, associated only with the petrol engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21.770 euros of the Luxury finish and 23.270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
Luxury Premiere

Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as she is, has opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, without even the ability to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see it on the street, I'll admit, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what you pay for, say, the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of about 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the email.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have been in operation for a long time.
Yeah, some operators have special deals and travel plans, but in my experience, it takes a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and a pair of good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated efforts of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming charges for all of Europe have had little tangible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (it is still funny that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets these types of tariffs means that the operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes traffic from book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts and no pipes.
It's a connected device, and you pay for it when you buy it, not month to month.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime purchase option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I check my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The color fetish of Michelle
Yellow is, without a doubt, the first lady's favorite color.
If you already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, you have chosen to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the reception in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish-yellow with bright reflections -, both times the outfit was composed of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or collar.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was following the footstep of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the dress.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a thick lace, in Oslo it is a stamped velvet.
The accessories have also varied: green shoes with half heels the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And the hairstyle is also different: a raised one this time, the previous one is loose.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed in the study 'Fecundidad y trayectoria laboral de las mujeres en España', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the start of cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.
Women who are not active outside the home, who work part-time or have a job with a fixed schedule, are more likely to start living together earlier, to have their first child earlier and to have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer children.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with a steady job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting to live together, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with steady jobs have needed more time of their life to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a great influence on maternity, but less on the mating calendar", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women at marriage and at the time of the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they get married and have their first child.
The difference also persists between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education became mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"A further division is made between women according to their level of education.
While those with elementary education marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those with intermediate or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child", Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oreal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The star of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, is joining other famous L'Oréal Paris signings, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its top designers and models, past and present, gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty radiographies of writers who have passed through his literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but looking for something resembling the ignition core of the creator character.
The trip has its excitements and Vincent spares no scares and illuminations.
Besides being a delight, the book is a moving invitation to read and reread.
Here are some snapshots.
Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same one I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against the cruel fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless, poetic humour, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him".
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition".
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed over the north wall, from which the best climbers come down again and again".
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said he was the heir of a county landowner and sometimes the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer took the demented cry launched from a bridge by that character from Munich to carry its echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century under its literary form and did so in a journey fleeing from himself and invoking the posterity with a violent speech to the worms".
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'Sleep after toil,/ After storm the harbor,/ Rest after war,/ After life's weariness pleases death".
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband would accept with perfect normality that she should tell him that Edward VII spied on her from among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
Never has there been a case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went before his madness".
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet want to do but pass Baroja for Faulkner's guns?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame to serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of a mixed breed, rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilos and, without a word, kicked her twice that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous aggression to a small and defenseless animal, which by the way, was tied.
To this we must add the suffocation which was caused by a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she encountered these individuals, became afraid for her physical integrity, since an energetic person who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, to anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt will do much good and to avoid generating suspicions, just clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they can find it amusing to mistreat a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among younger motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing products that are safer every day" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of motorcycle helmets, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety 'is a constant concern' for the company, since as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sales of light commercials rise
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% over 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the manufacturers' staff of Anfac and the Ganvam salesmen.
The good data, not the weak, should be put in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a drop of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a consequence, despite the upturn in the last month, the accumulated enrolments in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold, including all vehicles that make up the tailor's box of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of cars, pick ups, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
The clouds that most affect demand have not disappeared either, for although they are also purchased by private individuals, the majority of purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay for almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
So, to the restrictions imposed by the closure of bank credit, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this context, and unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to buy a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also take part in these operations, but the number of operations has been substantial.
Yesterday, Ganvam again reminded the need for the Administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sellers association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency brake assistance is now mandatory
As with anti-lock brakes and ESP, emergency braking systems will have to be a mandatory feature in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a grace period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, but, due to its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions due to reach.
The emergency braking assistant is what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the pedal that the driver gives.
But this one doesn't always hold that pressure to the end.
According to a study by the car manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not yet applied the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not used their full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The assistance intervention, on the other hand, puts the braking system under maximum strain, reducing the distance the car takes to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such devices, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with injury to persons could be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, help by increasing the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
In the event of failure to react, even if the collision is unavoidable, the device shall exert maximum effort on the brakes to minimise damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on the 8th probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points in the plan have been previously agreed by the party concerned.
And this may cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located to be delayed until early 2010.
GM says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which is also aiming to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining strength.
In the event that there was no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and most expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a basis and made it lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, first of all, the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, with which 21 kilos are saved; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; mounting sporting baskets another 12 and with the lightweight rims of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system added another six kilograms and by changing the door handles for cloth ones, the remaining kilogram.
Although also offered with the dual clutch PDK gearbox, the test was run on a six-speed manual gearbox unit, mainly on California back roads, on mountain sections with actually reversed tracks.
His behavior can only be described as impeccable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the car will not tread on the asphalt with aplomo.
On the contrary, we have not tested a model that is so small and light that it can be so safe in curves, even at high speeds, for a long time.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short walk for as long as necessary, until we tell him to sprint, brake, recuperate and re-express his engine...
Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system that modifies the engine roar, already premiered previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from standstill or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty messed up, but the car digested the potholes well.
The electronic aids were hardly present throughout the whole journey; and that in some of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can in the market and that is something more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.

Baskonia is awarded a victory in Israel
The Labor Box achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in his visit to the complicated court of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous losses with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and thus is in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 of assessment).
The Victorian team knew how to compensate for the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win the victory.
Also, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 three-pointers scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The game started head-to-head for the bluegrassers, who got ahead of the pack from the start.
The fact that the first four Victorian players were from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped into the Israeli court with the hot wrists..
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alawite team opted for the inside play of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with whistles and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding their advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'minus six' valuation already made it presage that this was not going to be the Brazilian's best night.
But the match, despite being on the road to rest, was not decided at all and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that in their court does not win anyone, and with 'the hand of Elijah' pressing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in turning the 'yellow's' back on the luminous (50-49).
Further Disadvantages
Ivanovic's, wounded but not much less dead, needed to make a couple of plays with success to catch their breath, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), who managed to make up the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaves came out to let their skin down in the last half and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's team did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the match already had a master and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting.
Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and gave them the lead in group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the casualties of the cajistas, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and not by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, with a fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to function showing its superiority within both zones, where the loss due to injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were weighing on the boxers.
Between the inside players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
A comeback is impossible
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, was superior and even equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group stagger.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for the direction and the triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the zone proved unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to get back the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja was off, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out what salary they deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads for real estate, employment and search engine in Spain.
The tool ¿Cuánto deberías cobrar? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140.000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer earns 45,226 gross euros a year and a French one 31,059 compared with 24,000 for a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver in England receives a net annual salary of 34,247 euros, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net annual earnings; followed by that of a servant, with 14,725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure from the race
The Brazilian government has given a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The outgoing President must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when his term of office would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, the business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy before that date, where he has been in hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when his term ends, he has to seek another destiny".
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil", Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately thwarted when Zelaya rejected the political asylum condition that the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, uncertainty is once again reappearing in the markets, which should not be surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertainty.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly giving free rein to liquidity at near zero rates so that financial institutions could buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are virtually complete and, without questioning their unorthodox liquidity policy, are starting to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its annual auction next week.
So investors are doubting the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of the risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have picked up again, though they are still far from the abnormal levels they reached earlier in the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and the public debt was again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice for investors, causing a widening of the differences between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened a further downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is good enough to silence the moral hazard advocates who were once again trying to create a burden of conscience on the world economic policy makers for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restraint on job destruction, when what they should have done is decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, the Dubai case paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to reconstitute power in the emirates and the Greece case we have seen before.
A government that hides the public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the rug.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It is not reasonable that Ecofin should save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and then allow a euro-member country to default on its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to hold its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves in an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads expand as do European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If the European differences are narrowing and ours are widening, then this is Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's story is an anecdote: when our forward-looking indicators are forcing most of the research services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the charge with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "prudence, driver friend".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his speech, followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommission behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
The Commission considers that the aid granted to the electricity producer in question is compatible with the internal market.
From 2020, the question changes and power must be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, he considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, yes, with other 'support energy'.
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the real decree to incentivize the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of combating climate change.
In his opinion, there is a "clear long-term commitment" in this respect, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system for the recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications.
Rail wins the handling of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's Swissport subsidiary for ground services will be the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not been overlooked in the economic terms, has a duration of five years.
Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of collaboration yesterday to create the Innovation Centre for Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% is to be made by Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market in which it already operates as an energy and water company.
The project in question is a tunnel worth A$1.7 billion (U.S.).
French Bouygues and German Hochtief are his rivals.
A 5 km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a builder and concessionaire of highways.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the Administration has a final list of candidates to take over the project and exploit the toll.
The investment is expected to amount to AUD 1.700 billion (€1.04 billion) and in the final phase three consortia with a significant presence of European manufacturers are competing.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liza, and his companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Acciona team is faced by the Northern Direct consortium, with the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is the LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specializing in civil works Razel share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatisations, but it is a very difficult market to enter if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
This is a strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, as well as by Asian companies, and it remains an open subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has only just achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, which owns Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a strong presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of infrastructure construction and operation.
The Northern Link underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane Office of Infrastructure, is to link the Western Toowong Freeway with the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map) along a 5 km tunnel. It is the largest undertaking to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule set by the administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of the next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two-lane trackage, electronic tolling system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute AUD 500 million (€308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane is already offering Hochtief business.
Australia continues to bear notable fruit for Hochtief, which announced yesterday the obtaining of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The company, which is owned by ACS, will, through its local subsidiary Leighton, provide the infrastructure for the national broadband network with optical fibre cable.
This action will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give the German woman a job for 18 months.
The company also sold the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia, which was still under construction and was sold for $129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarding a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for EUR 64,5 million.
The firm was awarded the contract only days after winning the extension works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in tunnel construction.
The works are scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will be carried out over a period of 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the Renfe ad.
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition organised by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined 63 million for restricting competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the country's Caribbean regions.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considered that France Télécom had committed similar infringements in the past and was therefore in a reoccurring situation.
App store
The French company's mobile subsidiary has also followed the example of other operators and opened an online application store, with the aim of increasing non-voice broadcast revenues.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have brought in 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a glorious event, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed €5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out of this division with a good showing.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has pocketed more money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, that has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the reigning champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also billed more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barça.
Moreover, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, three of England and two of Germany).
Distribution of the
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body that Michel Platini presides over expects to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will allocate €413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received €2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, plus another 550,000 euros for each match they played.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will each get $4 million.
The winner will win $9 million, compared to the runner-up's $5.2 million.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure in question does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
Barça on the other hand, bagged 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and it has four assigned seats.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the allotted money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for the 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday unraveled the details of the share purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige it to launch a public takeover bid (OPA) for all the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share to be paid over 10 years and to be repaid with interest for the 1% annual deferral.
Yesterday, Sos's shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the New Rumasa offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councilors.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to be carried out, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos's market capitalisation is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay out of possible bids and the judicial vaivenes of its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created post which will report directly to the group president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company is still engaged in the legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months the Socialist Group will reveal new diversions of funds.
Regarding the Salazar credit, yesterday former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Audience that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV approves the exclusion order for Paternina lodged by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the opt-out request submitted by Inversora Mer for Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation on the understanding that its terms are in accordance with the rules in force and considers the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December to be "sufficient".
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, which could not be transferred in any way until the completion of the offer, of which he specified that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools for car fitting
In these days of storms and accidents, it's not just the auto shops that win.
Every day thousands of car accidents are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repairs.
No two accidents are alike, and calculating the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculating manually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and a year's work, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
The service and solution providers for claims and maintenance assessment are engaged in collecting information from manufacturers, and then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the US group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of taxation and sector information tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies them with information in different formats.
The amount of data to be processed is also constantly increasing, to the point that more versions, variants and engine variations have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult job, because you have to catalogue each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, each model is made a "smart" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinned".
If it's a windmill model, the work can be done in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months.
Among the most exclusive models, information is available on Porsche, but not on Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet, it's over 99%.
To carry out the documentation and the preparation of the databases, Audatex has eight centres spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million pieces of data are included, and customers receive updates every other day.
The processing of this enormous flow of information enables these companies to give it different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is in repair and maintenance, but depending on which country there are also tools for management of scrap parts or to calculate the residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but they do in the United States.
The products offered by Audatex give an idea of the kind of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the star product being AudaPlus, the standard loss valuation solution, aimed at experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting scale.
This tool is payable on a per use basis, per each assessment.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of tests, negotiates their price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment it left the assembly line with only its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total loss.
The statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or for identifying deviations by brand or model.
For example, it can be studied how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer's times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the valuation of damages, breakdowns or maintenance of the car
The Gt Appraisal Guide is its historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and in 2008 they had a turnover of EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The worldwide turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will bring in 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and now its shares are trading for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles that have been damaged.
The operation involved a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased to the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sale service is exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scrap yards and professional sellers who must register before they can start to operate.
The platform was created in 1996 in Germany and handles over 650,000 transactions across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
The Spanish market is filled with about 100 new advertisements every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose number plate has been retired cannot be brought back into circulation, but certain parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be registered even if they have been written off after some farragosas gestures.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are usually more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 off-roading vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, you need a computer with an Internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question is displayed and the necessary replacement is then selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very happy about, because it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
