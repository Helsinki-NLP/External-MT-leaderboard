Number of new cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The number of new cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similarities between the EU/EU trade partners and the UK, which confirms that, although the COVID-19 crisis is at different stages in different countries, it is increasing at a rapid pace worldwide.
Based on the situation in Italy, states, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring treatment, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, cases of pneumonia with unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the disease was caused by an unknown coronavirus of unknown origin now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Data suggest that approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and the majority of cases are curable.
In about 14%, COVID-19 becomes a serious illness requiring hospitalization and 6% of people become very ill requiring intensive care.
The number of COVID-19 hospitalized patients and deaths is about 4%.
In this study, we analyzed the rate of COVID-19 cases in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the European Union (UK) and compared it to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries and Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread to other regions and the COVID-19 trend has picked up in other parts of the country following the outbreak.
On 11 March 2020, the Secretary General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 release dated 5 March, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first cases were detected in France on 24 January 2020 when the cases were reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with a total of 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Identify the number of COVID-19 cases and cases as COVID-19 increases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the COVID-19 case figures for every country in the world, from official sources such as the Ministry of Public Health, WHO's regional health and travel agencies, are updated daily at 2:00 a.m.
This data was used to analyse the COVID-19 situation in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compared it to that in Italy.
As a method of counting the number of COVID-19 active cases, we calculated the total number of COVID-19 cases divided by 14 days, in each EU/EEA country and UK, during the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also showed the number of confirmed cases in each country as it increased on 15 March 2020 at 02:00 am compared to Italy at 31 January15 March.
COVID-19 behaviour in EU/EEA and UK countries
The travel rates of COVID-19 cases reported in the EU/EEA and UK over 14 days generally followed those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the number of COVID-19 cases began to rise on or around 21 February and then increased sharply on or around 28 February 2020 (Source).
This was due to a rapid increase in numbers from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK had similar increases in COVID-19 cases (Sources).
Figure 2 shows the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to Italy during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 2:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had a total number of cases that was equal to that reported in Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our findings suggest that the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing at a very fast rate in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The recent trend in the number of COVID-19 cases suggests that the epidemic is growing at a similar rate in all countries.
This remains the case even though countries have different levels of healthcare, different criteria for determining whether a person is infected and different criteria for determining whether people should be tested for COVID-19, including increasing the number of people tested.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy reported a situation where 10% of COVID-19 cases required intensive care and news reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas were overcrowded.
The proportion of COVID-19 patients in hospital beds and/or intensive care units available at EU/EEA level is only 6% and 1% respectively, (these data are not reported).
Rather, these should be compiled in a well-organized manner in accordance with the information provided on the number of patients and deaths.
A 201011 study found a significant difference between intensive care beds and intensive care beds in Europe, with 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that some countries have more or less healthcare than Italy (12.5 acute care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010).
The potential for overcrowding of healthcare facilities, based on a comparison of COVID-19 bedside cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK and the risk of critical care beds being over 90% available, is outlined in the sixth ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases are still in some areas in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units serve populations in specific areas, information on patients and intensive care beds should be obtained in the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The situation in Italy and the developments in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 COVID-19 crisis is growing at a rapid pace in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the local population and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring treatment, especially intensive care, especially in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC's Emergency Risk Assessment, effective early preparedness is critical to halting the spread of SARS-COV-2, including the shift from containment to cure, as the rapid increase in expected case numbers may not allow authorities and hospitals sufficient time to identify, approve and implement the necessary measures if not implemented early.
Early diagnosis of the condition suggests health measures to combat the problem.
There is little disagreement on how countries can increase their efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is expected that healthcare in other EU/EEA countries will be under pressure due to the rapidly increasing number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and caused more than 80,000 new cases in China and elsewhere in the world, creating a humanitarian crisis.
As with the similar SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by mice and causes similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has fewer fatalities but is more common and affects older adults and men more than younger women.
In response to the many publications on this outbreak, this page aims to present a comprehensive review of the outbreak research.
We will discuss the basics of illness, its causes, germs, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention.
Although there are still many questions to be answered, we hope that this research will help to understand and address this worrying disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a memorable occasion for Chinese who were asked to stay indoors for the entire holiday and subsequent weeks due to the outbreak of an unknown novel virus.
The virus is closely related to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is also called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The disease began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to at least 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 cases cured and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one enemy of humanity and may be more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including virus, disease, causative, diagnostic and therapeutic data since the first report on January 7, 2020 which identified a virus sequence isolated from different patients.
The study aims to teach the research that has been done in this new stadium that is growing at a high rate.
At the beginning, we will try to compare COVID-19 and SARS with another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about prevention and predictions as well as unanswered and important questions.
CoVs were previously considered to be a relatively harmless virus to humans, causing about 15% of the cases of the common influenza 4.
However, in this century, we have seen two human-causing CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the first outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to other countries causing disease and death in large numbers.
The current COVID-19 is thus the third known outbreak of CoV in human history.
As shown in Figure.Fig.1,1, cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was published.
On 15 January 2020 the first case of an infection from Wuhan was reported.
At this time, the disease spread rapidly to the surrounding cities, countries.
On January 20, the medical condition was reported, which meant that people could be infected by the disease from humans.
On 23 January, Wuhan was closed and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, preliminary clinical investigations into the outbreak revealed that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had arrived directly from the Wuhan fish market where the disease was thought to have originated from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread to China and at least 50 countries worldwide (Figure 2).
As the situation changes, the outcome and the extent of the problem are unknown.
On 11 February 2020, a cross-sectional study of 8,866 people with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 provided a new definition of the virus (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
About half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years of age, a small minority were under 20, and only 14 cases were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 was found in more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is spreading among people in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 lasted for about 5 days (2-9) from the time of onset to the time of diagnosis.
The duration of symptoms was about 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The time from the discovery to death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), while the modified R0 value was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases spiked before 23 January 2020, due to the large number of people travelling ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), while the modified mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three most common complications of COVID-19 were sexual activity (men), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large and highly conserved subfamily of single strand RNA viruses.
It can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The (S) glycoprotein reaction is a reaction of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which the two lipids bind together.
The viral RNA gene is sent to the cell; after replication of the viral RNA gene, the RNA gene is a complex of glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins that form a viral protein, which then binds to the viral protein to produce the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was published on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV with a 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 samples collected from the first outbreak site, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV in genetics than MERS-CoV.
Using light sensors, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the respiratory tract.
ACE2 enzymes have been found to inherit SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 enzymes but is less stable than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent to humans than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a short, unusual protein called orf3b and a secreted protein called orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may be responsible for human infection and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain an active ingredient.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, and colleagues, demonstrated the complete cryo-EM structure of the ACE2 enzyme at a resolution of 2.9 Å in the amino acid B0AT1 membrane.
They found that the compound, which was composed of two double atoms, was arranged as a single atomic molecule and that the ACE2-B0AT1 molecule could bind S proteins, providing evidence of identification of the CoV and its host.
B0AT1 may be a potential treatment target for testing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
The source of the movement
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through mosquitoes and camels, in the same bacteria.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, bats are considered the most likely transmitter of SARS-CoV-2 because the virus is 96% similar to two other SARS-like CoVs also found in bats, SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the exact animal that helped jump the barrier to humans is still unknown, and its route has not been confirmed.
Ji and colleagues believe that snakes transferred the virus from bats to humans by exchanging S protein sequences.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have identified a pangolin - a small, insectivorous animal often used in traditional Chinese medicine - as a possible carrier of SARS-CoV-2 to humans based on 99% genetic similarity between the CoV found in the tongue and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between two genes is still large; therefore, the definitive evidence is not yet available (Fig. 33).
Most of the specifics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive in glass for up to 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days in a temperature range of 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation and temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; however, 75% chlorine, peracetic acid, calcium, and other solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective at killing the virus.
All humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to the virus.
Currently, no studies have been conducted to show a link to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only rely on previous studies on CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
Typically, when a virus attacks a mobile animal, the first step is to detect the animal's pathogenicity through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors (C-type), Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through a variety of pathways, the virus induces the formation, growth of dendritic cells, and release of interferons type I interferons (IFNs) that inhibit viral transmission and increase the resistance of macrophages to the virus.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV may help it escape the mosquito.
The adaptive immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to produce antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill the antibodies that are attacked by the virus.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help maintain immunity.
Instead, the CoV can inhibit T cell function causing T cells to die.
Humoral immunity, including proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also play a role in the fight against the virus.
For example, antibodies extracted from a recovered patient paralyzed MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the worm's overworked muscles produce a large amount of free radicals that cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, sometimes causing multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in humans, appears to be more likely to affect older people with other infections and pregnant women.
Generally, people with different strains of bacteria or with fewer moles are more likely to get sick than others.
The time it takes for SARS-CoV-2 to show symptoms is 1-14 days, with a typical range of 3-7 days based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the average duration of symptoms was 3 days and the duration ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, mentioned above, shows a median duration of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on 8,866 patients.
It is important for healthcare providers to set quarantine days based on the exact time the virus has been present in the body to prevent people with the virus but no symptoms from infecting others.
Generally, people living in a virus-infected environment or infected with the virus need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and most severe symptom of COVID-19, with no known symptoms or complications such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, runny nose, shortness of breath, and sneezing.
Some patients experienced difficulty breathing and/or shortness of breath within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients were prone to pulmonary insufficiency, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms related to respiratory and emergency fever, even if they do not have lung problems, should be screened early for infection.
A study of patients in December 2019 showed that the symptomatic rates were 98% for diarrhoea, 76% for dry cough, 55% for difficulty breathing, and 3% for shortness of breath; 8% of patients required respirators.
Similar findings were reported in two studies of patients in the same family and patients who were left with a non-symptomatic patient.
In comparison, a 2012 population study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and difficulty breathing (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respirators, mainly COVID-19 patients and this was coupled with the fact that MERS was more lethal than COVID-19.
Snoring (26%) and neck pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was reported that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), difficulty breathing (40%-42%), running (20-25%), sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and that respirators were required in 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the new COVID-19 death toll was 2% of the 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, the deaths from SARS in November 2002 accounted for 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, according to a demographic survey conducted in June 2012, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Earlier studies showed that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, frequency, and R0 are shown in Table 1.1.
These figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to be transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as dangerous as the other two.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is much more difficult to contain than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
People with epilepsy often live in the same home or meeting room or in the same vehicle.
The cases are those who have traveled from or lived in Wuhan or other outbreak areas or have been in close contact with people who have been infected or infected for at least two weeks prior to the outbreak.
However, it has been reported that people can be infected with the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital can also become infected again, suggesting the need to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the first stage.
For example, lymphopenia and white blood cell count &lt; 4×109/L including lymphocyte count &lt; 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were also elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe acute renal failure, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product in the blood, increased, and the number of lymphocytes decreased.
There are chest problems seen in most COVID-19 patients and this is accompanied by problems in their lungs (bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity).
Patients are more likely to develop unusual pneumonia, sudden lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, there is buildup and access to water, and the skin covers the wounds causing respiratory problems.
Pneumocytes of type I and type II (type-I and type-II pneumocytes) reduce surfactant levels and increase surface pressure, which reduces lung dilation and increases lung failure risk.
Thus, the worst breast test results are often the same as the worst disease outcome.
On February 18, 2020, the first clinical COVID-19 clinical trial detected the emergence of pneumocytes, hyaline production, skin inflammation, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, similar to the ARDS clinical trial and similar to the SARS and MERS clinical trial.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary method of COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, with many newly tested positive and positive cases, which may exacerbate the disease crisis, health status tests (not relying solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
The same situation was also seen in the SARS test.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, symptoms, diagnostic tests, and imaging is important and appropriate to make a proper diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a method of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter tested) using a dipstick in less than three minutes without the need for large-scale testing.
It is hoped that this new technique will be useful in the diagnosis of when it is collected from laboratory samples.
Due to the lack of knowledge about previously unknown CoVs, doctors are better able to monitor COVID-19 patients, as they test different drugs that have been used or previously prescribed to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Vaccine (Vaccine2).2).
This is a modern-day drug that can be used to treat bacteria, reduce the effects of plaque, steroids, plasma from survivors, Chinese medicine, and sedation.
Plasma from recovered patients was also approved for medical use.
Pharmaceutical companies are constantly working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and likely then attacks other ACE2-sensing organs, including the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Still, respiratory failure is a major health problem and a leading cause of death.
Therefore, respirators are essential in the management of respiratory distress and life-saving measures, including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory failure should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a procedure used to treat respiratory failure that can lead to death.
Furthermore, maintaining electrolyte levels, preventing and treating infection and transmission of the virus, and maintaining vital organs and tissues are also important in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that cytokine storm is caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a positive response of the body to the release of various cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the immune system to produce more molecules that are the main cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Reducing the appearance of cellulite is important in treating cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm therapies to reduce inflammation include T cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, used to reduce acne, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the impact of acne.
However, large doses of steroids did not reduce the risk of lung transmission in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
They can also cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which can affect the expected outcome.
Despite this, corticosteroids are recommended for use in very mild COVID-19 patients in low doses.
At the time of writing, there is no cure for the virus.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in a US COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antibiotic developed by Gilead that was originally used to treat Ebola and Marlburg disease.
Later, remdesivir was also found to be effective in treating other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on these, Gilead provided the vaccine to China for testing on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
Other drugs, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have also been proposed as potential treatment agents for patients with severe respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea, shortness of breath, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious complications may occur when lopinavir/ritonavir is combined with other medications.
Interactions between this drug and other drugs when used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients is antibody
Blood transfusions from people who have been treated for a disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to save lives have been used for some time.
In fact, people who recover from a disease often have more antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are antibodies produced by B lymphocytes to fight bacteria and other foreign substances and to directly target and degrade specific molecules in bacteria.
Based on this, plasma was collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was administered to 10 patients who were in critical condition.
Their condition improved within 24 hours, and their arteries and viral load decreased and their blood oxygenation decreased.
Rather, there must be a degree of certainty and awareness to make any method widely available before it can be developed.
Furthermore, because of the potential for adverse effects of medication, risks related to plasma should be considered first.
For example, antibodies can cause a buildup of cytokine-release syndrome, which results in a highly toxic reaction.
The antibodies in the blood are usually low, and the plasma requirement is high for treating serious illnesses.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies quickly enough to combat the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is possible to isolate B cells from recovered individuals and identify the genetic codes of antibodies to the disease or to test for antibodies to the main virus proteins.
In this way, we can increase the amount of antibodies produced.
TCM has been used to treat several diseases in China for thousands of years.
Rather, its effectiveness is based on the combination of different compounds in a drug that changes according to the diagnosis of the disease according to the TCM theory.
Most of the active ingredients are unknown or not well understood because it is difficult to identify and confirm the ingredients.
Currently, with no known cure for COVID-19, TCM is one of the most commonly used therapies for treating patients with mild symptoms or those who have recovered from long-term conditions.
For example, capsules from Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
A large number of patients recovered from COVID-19 in several provinces in China with TCM treatment in 87% of cases, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 cases, the recovery rate was lower (13%).
However, this comparison is unfair because there are many other factors such as the value and condition of the patients that must be considered.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published the results of a study comparing Western medicine alone with combined therapies that included traditional medicine and TCM.
They found that the time required for body temperature to return, for symptoms to disappear, and for bed rest was significantly shorter in the TCM+therapy group than in the TCM-only group.
Interestingly, the incidence of symptoms (from mild to severe) was lower in the TCM+compound therapy group than in the TCM-only treatment group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality was lower in the TCM+compound therapy group than in the TCM-only treatment group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Yes, the efficacy and safety of TCM still needs to be tested with additional factors in larger patient populations and in larger settings.
It would also be interesting to explain the practices and publicise the therapeutic or therapeutic practices of TCM where possible.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are often more likely to be at risk of the highly contagious and dangerous disease, and people who are quarantined also experience feelings of loneliness, isolation, and anger.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough, as well as severe medication reactions such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can exacerbate anxiety and headache.
In the early days of the SARS outbreak, there were a number of mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, tremors, distracted driving, inattention, and suicide.
Mandatory tracing and quarantine of patients as part of the COVID-19 response can increase anxiety and guilt over the effects of the virus, quarantine, and discrimination from family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, their immediate family members and all those who need it.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of teams of mental health professionals, timely and comprehensive information about SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of smart social distancing devices.
Vaccines are important in preventing the transmission of viruses from host animals and infected humans to carriers and often work in conjunction with antibiotics to combat disease caused by the pathogen.
Efforts are underway to develop a S protein-based vaccine to produce a strong and potent antibody that can paralyze and/or kill SARS-CoV.
A vaccine made from the virus itself was tested in animals for SARS.
However, the efficacy of the vaccine in adult humans and in lethal-challenge models and its effectiveness in the pathogenesis of the virus in animals must be confirmed before clinical trials can be conducted.
This is likely because SARS died 17 years ago and has not been seen since.
In contrast, MERS is common in the Middle East and spreads to other regions through the presence of animals living in those areas.
The MERS vaccine was developed using modified virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral replication and recombinant protein subunits and has been tested in animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in humans is urgently needed to combat the epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this challenge due to the long time (about 18 months) required for CoVs to develop and mutate.
As a novel disease, the full-blown COVID-19 behavior has only recently begun to manifest in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without remaining symptomatic.
However, as in the case of SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients are more likely to become seriously ill and die.
Therefore, anticipating the potential health risks is essential for health care providers to plan their services, especially in areas where service is limited.
Based on clinical studies, the following factors may be associated with the risk of complications in COVID-19 patients (Figure 33):
Importance: Importance is the most important factor in predicting the risk of complications for SARS patients, and this is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affected people aged 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients over 50 years in the study of 8,866 people as shown above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have other diagnoses and were older than those who did not (at an average age of 66 versus 51), meaning that age was a key factor in predicting the risk of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Other complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are at increased risk of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart failure was also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 can also infect ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and other health problems are closely linked and can affect one another in various ways.
Unusual test results: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) indicate inflammation or tissue damage and are defined as the risk of adverse events, drug reactions, and survival.
The link between CRP levels and the severity of complications in COVID-19 patients has also been noted.
Furthermore, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed in large quantities in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when something is damaged.
Thus, they are often a symptom of heart or liver disease.
Important medical symptoms: Chest scans and long-term monitoring of symptoms are recommended along with other factors to predict the risk of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are a muscle relaxant and are commonly used to help treat erectile dysfunction to reduce the severity of erectile injuries.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were used extensively in severe SARS patients, many of the patients who recovered developed avascular osteonecrosis, which left them with long-term disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental health: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered severe mental health problems due to long periods of quarantine and uncertainty and the death of their loved ones and fellow patients.
These patients need to be comforted and supported for a period of time to help them recover from this stress and return to normal life.
Based on human studies, COVID-19 appears to have different symptoms from SARS.
Apart from being able to multiply in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also multiply in the upper respiratory tract with minimal or no symptoms in the first few stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Thus, patients in the early stages or in the unidentified phase of the virus may produce a large number of viruses in their daily activities, making it difficult to fight the disease.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when cases were high, and transmission was low in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 pandemic is more severe and difficult to combat than the SARS pandemic.
A massive campaign is underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the quarantine of virtually all residents in an attempt to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the economic and social impact of these actions, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the problem is slowing down.
The best forecast is that the crisis will end by Wednesday and that the decline will last 3-4 months.
However, other experts have no such hope.
Paul Hunter, and colleagues, predicted that COVID-19, which was more likely to be transmitted than SARS, would not be eradicated by 2020.
Ira Longini, and colleagues, developed a method to predict the outcome of the pandemic and estimated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in patients who had been discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may be re-emerging as a flu strain.
However, promising signs have emerged in China in terms of the declining number of new cases, suggesting that existing measures may be effective.
Initial estimates put the number of Ebola cases at one million and the death toll at half a million.
However, due to strict quarantine and isolation policy, the disease has been successfully controlled.
It is possible, as in the case of SARS-CoV, that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken in its ability to infect humans and then either become extinct or weakened to survive in humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is shown below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through contact with infected objects.
The virus has also been found in the gut, suggesting that it is possible and possible to transmit the virus through poor diet.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of patients were cleared from hospitals, including 17 patients with other diagnoses and 40 doctors.
Therefore, there is a need to take extra precautions to save lives, especially those of doctors, consular workers, family members, workers, and those standing in close proximity to the sick or infected.
The first step to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; the use of sanitary masks and N95 (series #1860s) both help to reduce the spread of the virus.
Surgical antibiotics prevent contaminated items such as human saliva from traveling through the air or from sticking to objects, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can block 10 microbes at 80 nm, with only 5% of microbes fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and is 85 nm across.
Because the virus can also pass through five surgical masks stacked together, doctors approaching patients should wear N95 masks (series # 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the cancer, doctors must wear protective clothing to further reduce exposure to the bacteria.
Germs can also be passed on.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his closed eyes.
Therefore, doctors should also wear masks or goggles when working with patients.
For people in areas with or likely to have the virus, it would be advisable for everyone to wash their hands with soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors while keeping themselves in quarantine and minimize contact with people who may have the virus.
A distance of three feet is considered sufficient to keep a sick person at bay.
These practices are effective in reducing the chances of infection and transmission of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel human virus, its similarity to SARS-CoV as demonstrated on 7 January 2020 would have provided China with a valuable lesson based on its recollections of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, until 19 January 2020 the head of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan was reassuring the public that the new virus was not highly contagious and did not spread from person to person and that the disease was not difficult to prevent and control.
The news has largely silenced public voices, especially as the country prepares for the Spring Festival, and the timing of the outbreak was lost early in Wuhan.
The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may use this lesson to develop future vaccines.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when providing information to the public because each word has a meaning to the community and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more attentive to and respond to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) increase efforts to combat the potential for a pandemic in an effort to calm the population; and (4) regularly conduct experiments by increasing public awareness of the pandemic and testing and improving the way communities respond to all issues at all times.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to at least 50 other countries worldwide as of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV with similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to speculation that SARS has returned.
However, these are the main differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in the fight against the disease and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more often than younger people and men more often than women, and is more likely to cause illness and death in older people than in younger people.
SARS is more lethal than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients are susceptible to the virus even when they do not show symptoms and SARS patients are susceptible when they are very ill, making it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This is one explanation for why SARS-CoV-2 travels faster and has reached a greater distance than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 and RNA testing can be positive in some COVID-19 patients.
Furthermore, patients who recover from the disease may become infected again.
These findings greatly increase the chances of the virus spreading.
Despite the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, many key issues remain to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS-like mouse-like Cov-like viruses, we have not yet been able to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates in bats.
What animal in the middle evolved a virus from its original host, the bat, and transmitted it to humans?
Without the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively control the spread, and the disease can reoccur at any time.
Although molecular modeling techniques and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory cells and cause disease?
Does the virus also affect ACE2 resistance in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot quickly diagnose and even find effective treatment.
How long will the illness last?
How does a virus mutate as it spreads among humans?
Will it become a global epidemic, will it disappear like SARS or will it come back periodically like influenza?
It is important, but it may take time, to find the answers to these and many other questions.
Instead, no matter what we have to do, we have no choice but to end the disease as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The coronavirus originated from animals
Genetic mutations have caused coronaviruses (CoVs) and both animal and plant populations, including humans, to evolve over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, human coVs (HCoVs) of two strains were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed the landscape and highlighted how dangerous and deadly the HCoV can be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back into the wild and has surprised us with its rapid and less invasive transmission compared to the SARS-CoV variant.
HCoVs are of animal origin and understanding the origin of animal HCoVs is very helpful.
Most HCoVs originate in the lungs and are not pathogenic.
Some animal species in which HCoVs first evolve before they enter humans have also been identified.
Knowledge of the animals that infect humans is a key tool in the fight against human diseases.
Studying the interactions of CoV-infected animals can also help to determine the risk of CoV in humans.
In this review, we summarize the recent findings on seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery and their animal origin and their interspecies distribution.
Importantly, we identify similarities and differences between different HCoVs by looking at viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current outbreak of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is described in this context.
Furthermore, the factors that allow mutations in the host animals and the mutations in the virus are also discussed.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of viruses surrounded by a membrane, each positive-sensed, and have single stranded RNA.
The virus with the largest genome of 26 of 32 kilobases in RNA was named CoVs because of its crown-like structure when seen in a yeast tube.
In the building, CoVs have unbroken genomes and are coagulated.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two major homologous proteins (ORF1a and ORF1b), which produce pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are then synthesized to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains ORFs on structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many lineage-specific accessory proteins are also embedded in the different lineages of CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CoVs are classified into four broad subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV is the most common HCoV and is divided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
The results of the study suggest that bats and mosquitoes are the main source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have mutated from their animal origins and some have become the source of human disease.
To date, only seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
In this case HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the alpha-CoV family.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are common causes of mild illness, such as the common cold and/or whooping cough.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, affecting the lower respiratory tract in the majority of patients and with a high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The original HCoV-229E strain, B814, was identified in the urine of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, further discoveries have been made through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, it was widely believed that exposure to HCoVs was generally safe until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the deadliest in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a 10% mortality rate.
Within a decade, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused an outbreak in the Gulf of Arabia that spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of 3 March 2020.
The horn has sounded and the world must prepare for the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs originated from bats, mice or domestic animals.
The evidence is strong that all HCoVs originate in bats, where the virus is relatively stable and harmless but has very different sequences.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created serious medical, scientific, social and behavioral challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the origin of HCoVs in animals allows us to understand the history, motivation and prevention of transmission from one animal to another.
This could also lead to faster detection of the virus that transmits SARS-CoV-2 from the animal to humans, which could have significant implications for preventing future outbreaks.
In this study we provide information on the origin of HCoVs in animals, their transmission to different animals and the disease they cause.
In particular, we propose and discuss the general hypothesis that the HCoVs are harmless in their host species but become harmful when they migrate to another species.
We also studied how the HCoV mutates with increasing mobility and often decreasing infectivity.
The effects of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal-derived CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was isolated from the urine of patients with the common cold, most CoVs had been isolated from a wide range of infected animals, including chickens, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past few centuries, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of the discovery of HCoVs in their lineage (Table 1) will be instructive.
The HCoV-229E strain was first identified in a sample of patients with upper respiratory tract injury in 1966, and was identified as a mutant in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients with HCoV-229E had normal flu symptoms, including headache, cough, sore throat, fever and cough in 10~20% of patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was identified in organ culture and later in serial passage in the brains of mammals.
The clinical symptoms of HCoV-OC43 appear to be similar to those of HCoV-229E, with no symptoms that differ from other influenza viruses such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 both travel globally, and are most common in winter in mild weather.
Both viruses usually last less than a week to show symptoms, followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
Based on the study of volunteers, live subjects infected with HCoV-229E developed mild influenza.
A few patients with small fractures sustained severe injuries to the lower spinal cord.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first well-documented global HCoV-borne pandemic in human history and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third HCoV strain to be identified.
The first case of SARS was in late 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
SARS infected 8,096 known cases and killed 774, with a prevalence in many countries and continents.
In addition to the most common infections, it was estimated that each patient could infect two more people, with symptoms appearing on days 4 to 7 after the peak of viral load is on day 10 of illness.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experience joint pain, headache, fever, diarrhea and vomiting, followed by difficulty breathing, coughing and then fluid retention in the lungs.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are some of the symptoms of SARS that are seen in clinical trials.
Lung complications (diffuse alveolar damage), epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophage-mediated cell proliferation have also been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and an electrical respirator.
In addition to the lower gastrointestinal tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be injured in these severe conditions, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can lead to death especially in patients with low gastrointestinal function.
The virus was first detected in the flesh extracted from the lungs of a relative of the first confirmed patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a lot of effort has been put into research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was identified in a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was previously found to be more common in young children, elderly patients with low mobility and those with seizure-related diseases.
Coryza, eczema, malaria, and bronchiolitis are common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another study found the same virus in a sample from the nose of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first discovered in the Netherlands, it actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of respiratory illnesses, and is most commonly transmitted in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, or croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and pulmonary embolism in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and pneumonia, HCoV-HKU1 has also been linked to acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs are well known and are generally not expected to mutate to cause serious disease, although there have been cases of unknown causes such as the rare HCoV-NL63 strain, which was recently identified as causing serious disease in the lower peninsula of China.
Generally, these HCoVs acquire the ability to move around and live in humans, and become less virulent.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although all the infected patients are from the Middle East, out-of-country cases have been reported from close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
The last outbreak was in South Korea in 2015 and 186 cases were confirmed.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, with progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed renal failure, which is currently the only MERS in the HCoV-borne disease.
More than 30% of patients have intestinal problems, such as diarrhea and shortness of breath.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 clinically confirmed cases had a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most virulent viruses in humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, pneumonia cases known to have previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current low-level respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the disease is called COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a 3.4% mortality rate.
It is important to note that the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, compared to 1.2% outside of Hubei.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Fluid is also found in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe and rapidly progressive symptoms that can cause respiratory problems.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they fall into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is a mild but highly contagious strain compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients have been identified and may help to accelerate its spread around the world.
Comparison and cross-matching of SARS-CoV-2 and six other HCoVs reveal several similarities that are worth identifying.
First, the timing of the onset of symptoms and the duration of HCoV infection are very similar.
In this way, SARS-CoV-2 mimics the behaviour of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, a person with SARS-CoV-2 has symptoms common to HCoVs, including unknown, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of COVID-19 cases can also be detected as in SARS-CoV, although their prevalence is low.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also reflects the conditions found in the transmission of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as strong as that of HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is not yet known whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in malignant samples.
The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of a virus such as SARS-CoV in some cases has yet to be confirmed in future studies.
It is also important to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 may have had a period of self-replication similar to HCoVs.
However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, the disease-causing effects of its persistence and transmission through humans will be important for the outcome of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
All mild symptoms caused by HCoVs have been well tolerated by humans.
In other words, it may also be true that humans have successfully contained these HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of a previously deadly HCoV infection.
HCoVs that cause serious human disease and severe human HCoV infections have been eradicated.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans often enough to allow a replicate population to survive the effects of the person or object in which they live.
Thus, the more resistant SARS-CoV-2 is and the more people it infects, the greater its chances of adapting to humans.
When adapted, the spread of the disease among humans is difficult to stop by lockdown or other measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Over the years, four CoVs have spread in humans causing the common cold in people with healthy digestive systems.
The bacteria do not need to hide in the animal.
In comparison, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens are not well understood and cannot be transmitted to humans.
It must be present and active in its environment and seek opportunities to reach out to the weak, perhaps through one or more weak individuals to strengthen them.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar symptoms to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four other human locally transmitted viruses called HCoVs.
It is as transmissible as HCoVs in humans, at least as currently known.
However, it is more virulent than human HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and spread from person to person without infection or from animal to animal where the virus is not transmitted.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it is helpful to discuss the definition and symptoms of these terms, mutation, ecology, transmission, host of the non-transmitting virus and host of the virus that transmits HCoVs.
An animal acts as a carrier that makes the HCoV when it has a gene that is similar to a virus by sharing a gene at the cellular level.
The virus is usually familiar and does not cause disease in its environment.
Similarly, the HCoV virus is constantly present for long periods of time.
In both cases, the host is the infected organism and is the host of the HCoV or the parent of the virus.
In contrast, when the HCoV is placed on a host of a non-transmitter virus before or at the same time as it is introduced into humans, it is not adapted to the host and is often capable of transmitting disease.
A host of non-communicable viruses can be a source of disease in humans and play a role in the transmission of disease by preventing the virus from spreading and infecting humans and transmitting disease to humans.
HCoVs cannot spread if they cannot survive on a host virus.
In other words, HCoVs can adapt to a host of non-transmitter viruses and remain pathogenic for long periods of time.
In this way, the host of the unproductive bacteria becomes the host of the natural bacteria.
Disease reports have suggested that the SARS outbreak was linked to wildlife.
Well testing showed that the livestock traders had higher levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibodies in their bodies than the general population.
Bats (Paguma larvata) and the common Asian racoon were found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are very similar to SARS-CoV.
This was further supported by the fact that after killing the animals in the market, the SARS virus was no longer present.
However, wild or wild-caught bats prior to marketing were free of SARS-CoV, meaning that the animal would have been a non-transmitter but not a natural SARS-CoV agent.
Therefore, given that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that small animals may also be active in the host of the SARS-CoV virus cannot be ignored.
All of these appear to be infected with SARS-CoV but are not transmitted.
As a result, the SARS-CoV host animal showed a similarity to the SARS Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
The virus has antibodies against SARS-CoV and the BatCoV HKU3 strain.
This is a variant of the SARS-CoV that shares 88-92% of the genome with SARS-CoV.
This research laid the foundation for a new understanding that bats are the hosts of new human diseases.
Several SARS CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none other than WIV1 can be identified as a live virus.
An angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a host for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was derived from mouse mouse samples and has been shown to interact with mouse, mouse and ACE2 in humans to inhibit the transmission of the virus.
Interestingly, the SARS virus strain in recovering patients was able to disrupt WIV1.
Even so, WIV1 represents the closest relative of SARS-CoV in the mouse, sharing 95% of the genome.
In addition to the genetic similarity between the two viruses, it is widely accepted that WIV1 is not a close relative of the SAR-CoV and that the virus is not a close relative of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
Both CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same viral receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to transmit the virus.
The MERS-CoV RNA is similar to that found in bat beta-CoVs found in Europe and Africa.
Even so, no live MERS-CoV virus has been detected in mice.
MERS-CoV and its cousin CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the genetic material.
In this case, the mouse may not be the most susceptible to the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels carry MERS-CoV-positive antibodies, as in African camels from the Middle East.
The MERS-CoV is a human-like virus isolated from camel dung, further demonstrating that camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV.
It is important to note that mild but significant symptoms of the virus were observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Note, camels are not only infected by respiratory tract infections, but the virus is the main cause of infection in bats.
However, questions remain as confirmed MERS patients have had no direct contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which could be human-to-human or unknown transmission involving unknown animal strains of MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the genes with the RaTG13 CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
And as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so strong that it is difficult to determine the relationship between the two viruses.
That is, bats may not be as susceptible to the virus and spread SARS-CoV-2 unless there are other similar bats that are identified.
Speculation suggests that the animal that is infected with the virus that does not transmit SARS-CoV-2 is one of the species that are in the wild and are being sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first COVID-19 outbreak was initially controlled as a possible, animal-to-human transmission.
Several previous studies based on genetic modification suggested that the endangered pangolins (Manis javanica) may also have antibodies to beta-CoVs similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The newly identified pangolin-like organism that contains the CoV gene sequence shares 85-92% of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence.
Rather, it is similar to RaTG13 by about 90% of the gene level.
They have isolated 2 small lines of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in a new genome, one of which shares a genetic similarity to (RBD) SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% genetic similarity.
In a separate comparison, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differed significantly but were identified by genetic linkage.
Preliminary studies of the pandemic pangolin also revealed the presence of a virus in lung samples related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of techniques including genetic modification to find a gene that is 86.3% identical to the virus.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the species that are not transmitting SARS-CoV-2.
Currently, there is no data to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 pangolin because of the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolin beta-CoVs.
Similarly, the interval between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-CoVs.
The strain of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other humanoids is not yet known.
However, a genetic linkage has been found between RBDs and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share a common gene.
It is believed that the strong similarity between RBDs in pangolin SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is controlled by an isolated mutation.
A separate proposal supports a link between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the wild.
As a driving force in mutation, mutation is common in beta-CoVs.
A decision has not yet been made on the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen.
In addition to the most common pathogenic HCoVs, the animal-derived HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
Genetic studies suggest that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoVs in bats, while the parent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses were found in mosquitoes.
A variant of the coronavirus known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has been reported in North America as a tricolor and is closely related to HCoV-NL63.
In other words, HCoV-229E was genetically related to the Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 strain of CoV, which was reported in Ghana, and camels are also suspected of being host to the virus.
For clarity, existing information on animal origin for known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Evolutionary studies have provided information that HCoVs are transmitted in a wide range of species as they have historically been.
When HCoV-OC43 was transferred from a single species to humans from domestic animals in 1890, the respiratory disease was discovered.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E variants is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
There are several reports that support the spread of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas share habitat with bats.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are highly variable and not pathogenic, whereas alpaca alpha-CoVs have been found to cause disease in the respiratory tract of infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in animals that have returned to the wild from the wild.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas transmit HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, mosquitoes are the source of many human diseases including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
In other words, although alpha-CoVs act as the genetic source of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels may act as hosts of the non-transmitter virus that transmits the virus to humans as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of how it is transmitted from one species to another from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the mutation of MERS-CoV from bats is known from the very beginning and this identification has been reinforced by the discovery.
It is clear that bats have hundreds of species of bacteria that travel in different species and spread to different species.
Their longevity, large numbers of bats, close contact, and high-flying ability all make them a good vector for viruses.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been isolated from dromedary camels for a long time.
It is safe in these camels that have evolved from a germ-free nest to a germ-positive creature.
MERS-CoV causes few illnesses and is mildly transmissible in these animals.
The reported transmission to humans is accidental and people remain in contact with the MERS-CoV but are not transmitted because of its uncontrolled transmission.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, when isolated, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Most notably, pangolin beta-CoVs are the most common cause of disease in pangolins.
It may be a host virus that does not transmit SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as is the case with SARS-CoV mosquitoes.
The potential for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different strains from animals to humans has yet to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, the mouse may be infected by a SARS-CoV-2 resistant virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may compare their behavior to that of a digger.
Second, pangolins may be the host of the virus that transmits the SARS-CoV-2 antibody to which they were introduced.
People are infected by killing and eating carrion.
It is possible that domestic animals, including domestic animals, may be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of domestic and wild animals to identify their immune systems are necessary.
Third, as noted above, the genetic and adaptive differences of SARS-CoV-2 may have been caused by a third species related to bats and pangolins.
Research into the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals is ongoing.
In addition to the species of animals infected, three key factors on the bacterial side are also important in the development of CoVs to break down barriers to the spread of the virus.
First, their reproduction appears to be at the highest level of RNA.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the overall genome size is estimated to be between wm and high with a mean of ~10-4 per year per 2 species, depending on the CoV's level of adaptation and the presence of the previously unknown virus.
CoVs are capable of producing exoribonuclease, which, when produced, results in a decrease in the severity or in some cases in the impossibility of its production.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV transmission by inhibiting RNA-dependent exoribonuclease (RNA) polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds being tested in clinical trials.
In addition, the rate of CoVs infection is about a million times higher than that of the virus.
Similarly, the rate of mutation is often higher than that of CoVs when they are not known to be infected.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, indicating that it has now become fully human-adapted.
It may already have adapted to another human trait.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is already known to camels.
In theory, it seems likely that a genetic mutation could cause a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be less effective.
Second, the large RNA genome complex in CoVs suppresses the genetic mutation, thereby increasing the chances of species coexisting in their evolution, a positive feature of the emergence of the unknown CoV virus in the case of a mutation.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and the function of the protein at the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often spontaneously mutate during the reproductive process through the koppa-kynev process.
In the host virus, a transcriptional change occurs during the CoV RNA transcription.
Genetically similar RNAs and subgenomic RNAs can be combined to form other CoVs.
The mutation is a genetic mutation of the virus seen in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as SL-CoV and HCoV-HKU9.
Contact is contagious and can be a factor in the spread of disease
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host is also a key factor in the transmission of disease across species.
In this paper, SARS-CoV mutation is considered a known example of a signal-observed mutation during transmission known as positive selection.
Based on a cross-sectional analysis of human and mouse isolates of SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to be rapidly adapting to host viruses, particularly by mutating to RDB in S protein.
Generally, RBD in the S protein of CoV interacts with the immune system and is highly selective in the host cell.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is present in amino acid sequences 318 to 510 on the S1 fragment, which binds to ACE2 in humans and to the host bacteria.
SARS-CoV RBD can inhibit the ACE2 receptor in various animals, including bats, crocodiles, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to spread across species.
In fact, 6 amino acid residues were found to be different from those isolated from humans in RBD and 4 of them were found in the ACE2 receptor.
The new SARS-CoV has mutations in the K479N and S487T RBD genes, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein for ACE2 that is found in human viruses.
In other words, two amino acids that are inherited may be the most potent agents in the adaptation of viruses in humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 does not share the same pathogenicity as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 level of S protein means that the S protein and ACE2 family members in humans may have mutated.
In fact, cryo-EM studies suggest a 10-20 stronger correlation in this binding than ACE2 in humans and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to see if an alternative viral agent may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also activates ACE2 but using a different S-type gene.
There are also several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also explain the adaptation of CoVs to humans after they have spread to different species from the animal to which they are transmitted.
In addition to the viral receptors, the transmission of HCoVs between different species is also influenced by other factors that depend on the host and the host strain.
Differences in host proteins between humans and organisms that transmit HCoVs such as bats, camels and rodents may act as a barrier to the transmission of disease between different species.
HCoVs will isolate the host and avoid the host's barriers by effectively transmitting the disease to different species.
Thus, the molecular decisions in this important virus-host region still need to be analyzed and explained.
Genome-wide screening of SARS-CoV-2 viruses and resistance using advanced technology may be effective.
The emergence of previously unknown HCoVs: back to basics
The mutation of the fluid-bound CoVs offers a significant opportunity for the emergence of previously unknown HCoVs.
In this way, the bat CoV acts as the source of the genes for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene fusion also control the evolution of HCoVs and act as two key steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a previously unknown protein-coding gene has the potential to alter the overall structure of a bacterium.
Of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, while the SARS-CoV mouse-resistant virus has been isolated but has been found to have divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion marker for SARS-CoVs was found in a virus isolated early in the human outbreak.
This cleavage divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes adaptation to host bacteria.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of ability to bind to alpha- and gamma-CoVs, as evidenced by a low rate of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase binding.
Some of the non-covalent sites have been identified in nsp9, most in nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been reported that the early stages of the MERS-CoV outbreak involved cross-breeding, which occurred in camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the incidence of non-combination has also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs bind to animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It is also worth warning that human surveillance can cause unseen changes in viral genomes, mainly due to isolation from viral strains of surveillance, such as from the host mosquito.
An example of this type of damage is the severe loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, caused by double nucleotide destruction.
While unmodified ORF4 can be detected in bats and camels that are resistant to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoVs exhibit nucleotide release, from frameshift.
Last but not least, the growth of HCoVs has been unknown and is controlled by selective pressure in the host.
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms have been observed when bats infected with CoVs, suggesting a shared adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It was found that bats were familiar with CoVs in their development (anatomically) and in their normal life.
For example, the structural weakness in the kidney reduces the anomaly caused by CoVs.
In addition, the natural cell death in mice is hidden due to a decrease in the resistance of the NKG2/CD94 receptor and a significantly lower expression of class I molecules.
However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the digestion of food in the lungs can inhibit CoV replication and impair proofreading by exoribonuclease, resulting in selective stress to produce pathogenic strains when exposed to a different host.
Other CoVs may also multiply by mutation, producing unknown proteins or protein signatures that allow the host to adapt.
It is therefore not surprising that previously unreported HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in the transmitter such as measles and measles.
It is highly adaptable and does not cause severe damage to the host.
Herein lies the secret to the unseen spread of disease that causes the most devastating disease in human history.
The most serious symptoms are caused by the rupture of the spleen and cytokine storm, so the more severe the spleen is, the more serious the lung damage.
Compared to people without symptoms, mosquitoes are less likely to multiply in CoV transmission.
The same technique of removing the pathogenic pathogen may be useful in treating SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon system is very powerful in the kidneys.
Therefore, treatment with type I interferon at least as long as SARS-CoV-2 infection is detected in humans must be successful.
Similarly, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the lung has no effect.
In this sense, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in combination with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak follows a common theme that was inherited from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoVs have been found to share 95% of the nucleotides with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat CoV that shares 96% of the nucleotides with SARS-CoV-2.
However, poultry and other animals sold in markets have been found to harbor SARS-CoV-like pathogens, which are the host of the virus that did not transmit SARS-CoV-2 before it was discovered.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to have remarkable similarities to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may act as hosts of a non-transmissible virus or pangolin beta-CoVs may have a gene that causes the final mutation of SARS-CoV-2.
While there are still questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally engineered by humans.
CoVs have been decreasing in popularity due to the earlier SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Research on CoVs in bats and other animals has rapidly changed the understanding of the role of animal-borne and HCoV-hosted diseases in human transmission.
Strong data suggest that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans through non-transmissible host species.
Since SARS-CoV is caused by human-to-human contact with fungi in markets, closing markets for raw materials and killing fungi would be important in halting the spread of SARS.
Similarly, pangolins should be removed from the green market to prevent the transmission of animal-to-human disease, with a view to identifying a variety of pangolin beta-CoVs that are highly resistant to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other hominins and how it is transmitted will be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for a long time.
Camels are a vital transportation resource, and camels provide much of the meat, milk, hides, and feathers for humans.
They are common in parts of the Middle East and Africa.
It is now difficult to kill all camels due to the MERS vaccine, which is being developed in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent further outbreaks of MERS, a vaccine against the disease should be developed to produce a vaccine against MERS-CoV camel, in combination with other immunity measures.
Because we cannot eliminate one strain, another strain can develop and cause another.
A variety of CoVs that transmit disease from animals to humans have been found in the wild.
In particular, it is a pathogenic CoV that has the potential to transmit disease from mice to humans in a variety of ways.
There is a high probability that animal-to-human transmission of disease is not caused by the emergence of new, rapidly transmitting CoVs and/or the presence of the new human host.
The practice of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be discarded to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the context of the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 pandemic, better preparedness and response strategies are needed.
In fact, many microbes have been around for thousands of years.
They remain in their natural habitat until the opportunity arises to migrate.
Although bats have many ways of transmitting germs, the chance of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are told to stay away from them.
Continued observations are needed in human-like animals to better understand the evolution of CoVs and the biological host that will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent the spread of animal-to-human germs is to prevent humans from living in natural habitats that transmit disease from animals to humans.
There are many unknowns about the origin of the animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it is important to assess the conditions in which bats and pangolins share their habitats.
Second, if the mosquito plays a role in transmitting disease directly to humans, then the way humans are exposed to mosquitoes needs to be considered.
Third, if a hominid is to be considered a host of a highly pathogenic organism, its interaction with other species including humans, bats and pangolins must be highlighted.
Finally, since many domestic animals including humans are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and testing for both diseases should be done.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other hominid, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogenic viruses with a similar pathogenicity will be detected in the host ecosystem.
Further research on this topic will shed light on the evolutionary role of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, including its potential for significant effects in the prevention and prevention of COVID-19 in humans.
Alignment of the criteria for confirming a suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patient is required
On 6 February 2020, our team released a rapid diagnostic and treatment guide for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which demonstrated our expertise and demonstrated how to effectively manage the outbreak globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our knowledge of it is increasing based on ongoing research and clinical trials; therefore, diagnosis and treatment are also being updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of our guidelines and provide the most up-to-date guidelines for determining presumed and confirmed based on the latest guidelines in the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version)) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global public health emergency.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a rapid response strategy that was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
They have been popular since their publication.
However, it is worth noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge of it is increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical trials; therefore, diagnosis and treatment are also being updated.
The Testing and Treatment of COVID-19 results of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have just released seven releases with some cases in critical condition.
Our results, as described by Zhou and colleagues, suggest a simple diagnostic method based on clinical findings.
Their work has added to the credibility of our standards and has brought attention to this worldwide problem.
We acknowledge and commend their fine work.
However, their work also needs to be updated in light of the new COVID-19 Testing and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) and new research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected patient requires a combination of one of the following criteria for medical history and two medical clinical criteria for making a final decision, or three medical clinical criteria for a patient with no known medical history:
A history of infection: (1) having been in or near Wuhan or the surrounding areas, or other areas where COVID-19 cases have been detected in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) having had direct contact with people with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) having had direct contact with patients with malaria or respiratory distress from Wuhan or the surrounding areas, or other areas where COVID-19 cases have been detected in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) having had direct contact with ≥ confirmed cases (2 cases with severe symptoms and/or 2 cases in a week were detected in a public health facility, hospital, school, community, or community setting).
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and/or difficulty breathing; (2) symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) a decreased or normal white blood cell count or lymphocyte count in the early stages.
Confirmation of a patient should be performed on a suspected patient with evidence of infection or a fluid test as follows: (1) when a random PCR test results in a positive SARS-CoV-2 profile; (2) when viral whole genome sequencing demonstrates strong similarity to the novel coronavirus; (3) when a fluid test results in a positive IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2; or when a positive LGG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 is changed from negative to positive, or when the titer rises ≥4 times during recovery from the normal course of the disease.
Note that the rapid PCR test for nucleic acid detection in semen or blood was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
Diagnostic of the blood sample was added on the fourth release (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); while the confirmation of the body fluid test was added on the seventh release.
This change is based on the efforts of researchers to develop a nucleic acid-sensitive test for rapid testing, as well as samples from a blood sample collection, which has increased the availability of a variety of tests, and supports the availability of antibodies themselves as a basis for assessing the patient.
In addition, there is much evidence to remind us to be cautious of patients who show no unusual symptoms.
Therefore, the chart of Zhou and colleagues deserves to be revised, because it showed a person without symptoms as having a low risk.
This score system also needs to be validated in other clinical trials and other studies.
In summary, we hope that further evidence will emerge and invite readers to comment on it.
With the knowledge of the predicted and verified, we recommend the observance and compliance of the latest laws of your nations.
Our team will update our guidelines in time to help.
Bangladesh reports five more deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed that five more people died from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) had registered 114 patients and 33 recovered at home.
A total of 17 people died.
In a press release, IEDCR official, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two of the deceased were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41-50 years old.
He also said that two of the people were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, as a news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, an official of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladesh's Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said in a video announcement that all public transportation would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The curfew had started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on April 4.
The transportation of essential goods -- medicine, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were reported on 8 March, when two people returned to the country from Italy and the wife of one of the people.
19 By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has caused one million cases worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide as reported by Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand people are reported to have died from COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
This was achieved on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first case and Zambia reported one death from coronavirus.
North Korea said on Thursday that it was one of the few countries that remained free of the coronavirus.
On the afternoon of 4 April, the World Health Organization reported a total of 1,051,635 new cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the 24 hours before 4 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases have been reported and at least 5,900 deaths have been reported.
CBS News quoted Johns Hopkins University as saying that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday from the coronavirus.
Worldwide, nations have announced strong measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will be paid even if they do not return to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the 15-day deadline; a majority of 215 voted in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the coffee hour in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina by a full day; initially, coffee was served between 9 p.m. and 12 a.m.
Thailand prepares coffee between 4 pm and 10 pm.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the curfew until May 1.
Australian stores place a limit on the number of tickets a person can buy at a time
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, Australia's national supermarket chain Woolworths and Coles places a cap on the number of candy bars a person can buy in either of its two stores.
ALDI also set a limit for one sister on Monday.
The ban was shown as a message to the public on the Facebook pages of the companies.
Customers were told to be prepared for COVID-19 fears as people were required to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of home delivery candy to one candy bar a day.
The changes follow the initial restrictions of four cents per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March in both companies in the same series.
In a letter from Coles dated 8 March, he reported that the restrictions on smoking were still in place, "many stores are closed within an hour of their arrival", and said that the demand was "unprecedented", while ALDI, writing on Facebook on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales were "up" last week according to a spokesperson for Woolworths.
Costco in Canberra also lowered the price of two bottles last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles had the workers increase their workload and increase their hours of work, Woolworths ordered more, and ALDI brought more as scheduled on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said the retailers were trying to increase their stock but the restrictions on the number of vehicles brought by the authorities were a challenge.
He expects to increase the amount of money spent, as the staff tries to keep up with the demand and the fewest days available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the release of the quick sale, some stores will not be able to do the Wednesday exception.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a specialist in the marketing of cotton from Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are bringing in sales every night.
He said that the cows are large, which makes the stores cheap, so that when the stock runs out, the milk is left in a dry state and creates a feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that "Coles and Woolworths believe [that] if there are more items in the mass market, products like toothpaste and hand washes [are] sold in larger quantities, packaging waste can be reduced".
One of the workers who worked in the sheep herd said on Wednesday that the flies had disappeared.
Kimberly-Clark, manufacturer of Sorbent, and Solaris Paper manufacturer of Sorbent, insist they were working 24/7 to keep up with demand, according to a report by News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some vendors were offering free hammers to the first ever Melbourne hammer winner, with a small hammer sale due to customers having a long weekend off including Labor Day.
In the Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin daily, there was a booklet of eight pages that was to be pulled out and used as a shell.
Stores initially refused to impose restrictions, according to reports from ABC Australia on 3 March where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that products are also on the market, including masks, hand washes, dry food, hand soaps and powders.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the online store Ocado was seen banning the purchase of Andres brand candy as a buyer of between 2 and 12 candies.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global emergency
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19  a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  a global pandemic.
Although the term "global epidemic" refers to the extent of the disease, not to the severity of the disease, WHO has suggested that governments should take action:
"All countries can change the way this global epidemic spreads.
If countries monitor, test, treat, isolate, monitor and mobilize people in this regard", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned about the spread of this disease and its seriousness and its overwhelming indifference".
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the epidemic was "unexpected".
He said, in a CNN report on Tuesday, "apart from this one, no other virus that has affected the respiratory system has been identified since its outbreak to have spread globally".
Ghebreyesus made the same point, saying "we have never seen a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus".
He adds: "We do not see a global problem that can be solved".
The new global epidemic came after the WHO decided in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, described the outbreak as "a highly contagious disease, which is on the verge of extinction".
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, of which 4,600 died.
The 2019-20 global coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing outbreak of the 2019 pandemic disease (COVID-19), caused by a virus that infects the respiratory tract called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency on 30 January 2020, and a global emergency on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories and at least 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people survived.
The death rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while the global rate is 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
The complications of the disease can include pneumonia and severe respiratory problems.
The time from infection to symptoms is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or treatment for the virus.
Primary care is based on symptoms and a few treatments.Recommended prevention measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, monitoring and quarantining if you suspect you have the disease.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace lockdowns and lockdowns.
The crisis has also disrupted the health and economic well-being of the global population, increasing or decreasing sports, religious, political and cultural events, and creating a shortage of goods and services caused by consumerism.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread on the internet and there have been cases of hate and discrimination against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people or people of color from areas affected by the virus.
Due to the closure of transportation and large industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a small number of cases of unidentified virus on 31 December 2019, and an investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases were found in contact with seafood from Huanan (Seafood Wholesale Market) and the virus is thought to have been transmitted from animals to humans.
The virus that caused the outbreak is SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus similar to the bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.The first case was later identified on 1 December 2019, and the case was not associated with a green market.
Of the first cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unidentified report from the South China Morning Post reported that a previously infected patient on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may have been the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new cases decreased in China but quickly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases inside China for the first time.
There may have been a lack of accurate figures, especially for those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, a small number of cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the population in the UK could be infected before the virus was detected in the general population.
The case refers to the total number of people tested positive for COVID-19, and the positive test is based on official data.
By March 23, no country had more than 3 percent of its population, and many countries have a policy of not testing for mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March showed that in China, as of 23 January, 86% of patients had not been vaccinated, and that those who had not been vaccinated were injecting 79% of those who had been vaccinated.
A statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than previously reported.
The initial estimate of the initial infection rate (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the number could be as high as 5.7.
Most people who get COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days but is higher in the general population of 14.
As of 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 people were reported to have died of COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, nearly 80% of deaths were among people over 60 years of age, and 75% had other medical conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The latest COVID-19 death rates reported by the authorities are mostly those who tested positive for COVID according to official data.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher because there may be no deaths without testing - including at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Regional data from Italy found that the death toll during the outbreak was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID-19 figure.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "we know that [the death toll] is inaccurate", which was confirmed by a public consultation in the United States.
The first death outside China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen people died in each of these countries, Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
13 By March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on nearly every continent except Antarctica.
These rates vary from region to region and time to time and vary with the number of tests, the quality of care, the available treatments, the length of time since the onset of the disease, and the demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate relative to cases is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the estimated mortality rate relative to the incidence decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning on 1 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020).The measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people diagnosed with death from a disease, and the infection rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people diagnosed (and untreated) with death from a disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow some individuals from the onset of the disease to the end of the patient's life.
Several researchers have tried to estimate the numbers of certain populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the prevalence of epilepsy is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this rate confirms the results of the first clinical trial of COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical analysis of the trial makes predictions of mortality.
WHO estimates that this global epidemic is preventable.
The onset and duration of the disease are unknown and may vary from place to place.
"If the outbreak is not prevented, it will spread and then it will go away", says Maciej Boni of Penn State University.
But it is almost impossible to predict at this time when it will be".
Senior adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could be gone by the end of Saturday" if all countries could be encouraged to follow WHO recommendations to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be viral, probably for a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, interventions and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
"I think that the coronavirus, because of its rapid spread, will disappear completely", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, "and it could become a temporary disease that comes back every year".
The risk of its return will depend on the species and the species.
COVID-19 symptoms may be subtle and patients may not have any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry chest (68%).
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, wheezing, shortness of breath, joint pain, sore throat, headache, wheezing/panic, nausea, hemoptysis, runny nose, or cyanosis. WHO reports that one in six people are chronically ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the most common symptoms as shortness of breath, chest pain, sudden dizziness, difficulty in walking, and facial or oral contact; these symptoms require immediate medical attention.
Some patients may not show any symptoms, but if they are diagnosed with the disease, then researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with confirmed cases should be closely monitored and tested for the disease.
The Chinese government estimates the prevalence of symptoms to be between a minority and 44%.
The incubation period (the time from infection to onset of symptoms) is usually from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.In a more uncertain scenario, estimates of the number of COVID-19 cases with no vaccine initially were 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some of the details of how the disease spreads are still unclear.
The disease is thought to be spread by contact with infected persons and by contact with a fecal matter transmitted by coughing, sneezing or speaking; and the contact is usually between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing while not covering your mouth can cause a well to run from 15 to 27 tons (4.5 to 8.2 meters).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be spread by airborne particles, which can be released through the mouth. Inhalation fluid can also be released through the mouth and during speech, although the virus does not usually travel through the air.
The fluid can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or be absorbed into the lungs.
Some treatments, such as CPR and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause a hole in the lungs to open and cause the infection to spread through the air.
It can also be spread by contact with an infected object, such as a body, face, or mouth.
While there is a fear of it spreading to the bad, this hostility is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spreading aggressively.The virus is most likely to spread in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although transmission is possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of infection.
People are diagnosed with the disease three days before the onset of symptoms, which indicates that transmission is possible even if no severe symptoms are present.
There are few reports of confirmed cases without symptoms, but transmission from asymptomatic to asymptomatic has been observed in some countries following contact with other people.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not clear how the disease is spread, it is usually transmitted from one person to two to three people.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to live for three days on a plastic (polypropylene) and 304°C (90°F) sheet, for one day on a cardboard and for four hours on a leather.
However, this varies depending on the source of air and temperature.Pets and pets have also been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although authorities in the UK recommend that people wash their hands after touching animals, such as when touching items that people suspect of being infected with the virus.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unidentified virus, first identified in three cases of resistant to the highly contagious respiratory virus found in Wuhan.
All previously unknown symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are present in the coronaviruses that are similar to the rainbow.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which kills the protective membrane.SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have evolved from animals and then returned to humans.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically similar to the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) and two bat-derived strains.
It has 96% similarity at the genome level with other bat viruses in its samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and the human.
To date, the largest genome comparison of any species has found that 92% of the genetic material is shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which has not yet proven that pangolins are viruses.
The presence of the virus can be detected by primary symptoms, but confirmation is achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in damaged tissue or by computed tomography (CT) imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT is more safe than PCR, although it is not a clear indicator, and that the image fragments are lost to other infections.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT be used as a diagnostic tool or as a primary screening test for COVID-19".
WHO published RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on a sample of the urine or blood.
The results are usually visible within a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed on a nasopharyngeal swab although a nasopharyngeal swab may also be used.Many clinics and companies are developing a blood test to measure the immune system.
6 As of April 2020, none of these had been scientifically proven to be effective enough to be validated for widespread use.
In the United States the blood test developed by Cellex is approved for emergency use only in confirmed clinical trials.
Symptoms on radiographs and CT scans of symptomatic individuals include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is working on an online collection of images of confirmed cases.
Due to its association with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is not as reliable in diagnosing COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT of the chest with PCR and showed that although the imaging is not a reliable indicator of disease, it does suggest that it needs to be carefully used as a diagnostic tool in infected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks are designed to simulate viral imaging using radiographs and CT scans.
Prevention measures include maintaining good hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the face, nose, or lips without washing hands, coughing or sneezing with a cloth or paper and placing it directly in the trash.
Those who may be ill are advised to wear a mask when walking out of the house.
Many governments have restricted or advised people to avoid travel unless it is necessary to travel to or from areas affected by the disease.
Instead, the virus has reached a point of spreading in a regional context to many countries around the world.
This means that the virus is spread locally, and some people in the community are unaware of where or how they were infected.Nurses/caregivers who care for a potential patient are advised to be cautious, to have careful contact, and to wear masks.Tracking contacts is a key strategy for health care providers to identify the source of the infection and prevent further spread of the disease.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has led to privacy concerns as Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for a limit on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been used or are being developed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than 20 expert groups were making recommendations on privacy issues such as using Bluetooth to connect a mobile user to other devices.
Users receive messages when they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Delirious messages are commonly circulated about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and mouth with water but not all of them work.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many agencies are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of infection.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water at least 20 minutes at a time, especially after using the toilet or if their hands are very dirty; before eating; and after someone sneezes, coughs or sneezes.
This is because outside the human body, bacteria are killed by household soap, which kills the infected skin.
The CDC further recommends using disinfected water with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their face, nose, or lips with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a water solution (within one minute if the product is made of steel and a patient is touching it), which contains 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other aqueous chemicals, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are not effective.
The CDC recommends that if a person is suspected or confirmed to have COVID in a facility such as an office or childcare facility, all facilities such as offices, restrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, laptops, limousines, and ATM machines used by an infected person should be disinfected.
Health authorities recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with a cloth or a handkerchief immediately.
Masks are recommended for those who may be ill, as wearing a mask can limit the amount of fluid a person has when they talk, cough or sneeze.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how vaccines should be used.
According to Stephen Griffin, a microbiologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the risk of infection and is a greater source of transmission than if one does not wash one's hands properly.
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks during high-risk situations such as when caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it is believed that wearing masks can help people avoid exposure.
Many countries have begun to encourage everyone to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends that people wear non-medical masks made of cloth.China recommends using single-use medical masks, especially when one person is going to be close to others (one meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a mask when riding a motorcycle or when living in a crowded area.
Health authorities in Thailand encourage people to make a toilet at home and wash clothes daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from leaving the house unless they wear masks or face coverings.
On 16 August, Vietnam required everyone to wear masks when going out in public for their own protection and to protect others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask when entering a store.
Israel has asked every citizen to wear a mask whenever they are in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, on 1 April ordered passengers on trains and buses travelling in cities to wear masks.
Panama has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask when leaving home, and it is also encouraging people to make their own masks at home for those who cannot afford them.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing includes measures to prevent the spread of disease by limiting contact with others.
The measures include quarantine; restrictions on movement; and closure of schools, workplaces, sports grounds, recreational areas and shopping malls.
Individuals can avoid being in public places, avoid social distancing, avoid touching people, and avoid throwing people away.
Many governments now require people in affected areas to isolate themselves.
The maximum population recommendation by US government and health departments has been reduced from 250 (if there are no COVID-19 cases in the community) to 50 and then to just 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany cancelled gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with other medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and dysfunctional lungs are at high risk and the CDC advises them to stay at home as much as possible, especially in areas with an epidemic.In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began using the term "isolation" and "isolation" to describe the intention to reduce exposure but to avoid contact with other people or with one another.
The use of the word "isolate" has led to the idea that people should isolate themselves from one another, rather than encourage them to maintain communication with one another through other means.
This includes encouraging them to have sex with only the person with whom they live, who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Social isolation is recommended for those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who suspect they may have been exposed to the virus.
Health authorities have issued individual quarantine guidelines.Many governments require or recommend quarantine for all people in affected areas.
Stricter quarantine orders have been issued in high-risk areas.
Those who may have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19 and those who have traveled to a country or region where the disease is prevalent are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time they may have been in contact with the disease.
The tactics at the beginning of the process are to fight or prevent them and prevent them.
Prevention is carried out at the beginning of the outbreak and aims to monitor and isolate those affected and to introduce other measures to control and prevent the spread of the disease in the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to stop the spread of disease, then the focus is on disease control: measures are taken to slow the spread and prevent the consequences in the health system and society.
Both the preventive and the weapon can be used at the same time.
Reduction requires concerted action to reverse the decline in the number of infections below 1. One way of controlling a communicable disease is to slow the spread of a disease by attempting to slow the spread of a more serious disease by flattening the curve.
This reduces the risk of a busy healthcare system and gives you enough time to respond to the vaccine.
Alternative treatments for the disease include preventive measures such as hand washing, wearing masks, and self-quarantine; social distancing measures such as closing schools and disrupting public gatherings; encouraging sexual activity; and community-based measures such as sanitation.More aggressive measures have been taken in China to control the disease, such as quarantining all cities and enforcing strict quarantine laws.
Other countries have also introduced additional measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced a public quarantine and quarantine, and a travel alert for sick people.
Singapore helped those who quarantined themselves as sick by giving them money and fining those who refused.
Taiwan has increased its production of vaccines and has recruited people who have been hiding medicines.Reports from the UK and the US show that prevention (not stopping the spread of disease) and disease control (preventing the spread of disease) are both major challenges.
More effective disease control measures could reduce the increase in medical demand by two thirds and deaths by as much as two thirds but at the same time result in tens of thousands of deaths and hospitals being left without a place to house patients.
The limitation of disease may be greater but should be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating (or until a vaccine is developed, if it is the first), but the disease can recover if it is treated.
Long-term efforts to combat disease are costly and costly.
There is no approved vaccine for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop a vaccine, including testing the current vaccine.
Taking cold medicines, drinking a few drinks, and resting may help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the injury, ventilation, water and ventilation may be necessary.
The use of steroids can complicate the situation.
Many drugs (compounds) that have been used to treat other viral diseases will be investigated for their use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also noted that "some of the traditional treatments" may alleviate some of the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adaptation to the needs of COVID-19 patients as defined by WHO is a critical step in the response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO's European office have published hospital and primary care guidance for the delivery of healthcare at various stages, including focusing on clinical trials for COVID-19 diagnosis, delaying other non-emergency procedures as soon as possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, and increasing the quality of care through training of staff and increasing the number of assistive devices and beds.
There are different theories about the origin of the first patient (called patient zero).
The first case of an unidentified coronavirus was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily rising.
These were connected to the Huanan fish market (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market), which sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, its origin is in animals.An unknown strain of pneumonia was detected on 26 December while he was being treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, which Wuhan Jianghan CDC reported on 27 December.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned colleagues of a possible outbreak of a virus similar to the "SARS coronavirus".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were charged with spreading false information and Ai Fen, charged with publicity by his employers.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a notice on 31 December informing WHO.
A number of patients with unknown causes had been notified by Wuhan authorities to begin investigations in early January.At the beginning of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, aided by Chinese New Year celebrations and the fact that Wuhan is a busy city and railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported having at least 140 new cases in a single day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data showed that 6,174 cases had been confirmed as of 20 January 2020.[citation needed] On 26 March, the United States surpassed China in the number of confirmed cases worldwide.[citation needed] As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 cases had been confirmed worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and 364,000 had recovered.[citation needed]
About 200 countries have reported at least one case.
Since I arrived in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted travel and have imposed restrictions on their borders.
Some of the measures that have been implemented include quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, curfews, or lockdowns) and curfews.As of 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in some form of lockdown in the United States, over 50 million people were in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people were in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in various forms of vaccination and the number rose to 2.6 billion two days later - almost a third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 is believed to have been detected on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; there is one preliminary report that the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with a group of unidentified cases of influenza brought in on 26 December, after which the hospital reported the incident to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
The first genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 showed positive SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was notified on the same day.
Following the announcement, Wuhan medical professionals were alerted by the police for spreading the word about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission had previously said there was no "confirmatory data" on person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a massive campaign described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to control the spread of the virus.
Referred to as the "biggest quarantine of human history", the lockdown was announced on 23 January to halt travel to and from Wuhan, and was extended to at least 15 cities in Hubei, affecting an estimated 57 million people.
The use of private cars was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
A second hospital was built later, Leishenshan Hospital, to accommodate more patients.
In addition to the new hospital, China also upgraded 14 other sites in Wuhan, such as boarding houses and football stadiums, and made them temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government introduced additional measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, including passenger health records and extended Spring Festival celebrations.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The provinces of Hong Kong and Macau have imposed strict restrictions, especially on schools and universities.
Work-time arrangements have been introduced in many parts of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and around Hubei.
Public transportation has been reversed, and tourist attractions have been temporarily closed.
Public movement restrictions were imposed in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) received a dose of vaccines.[citation needed] When the outbreak spread globally in March, Chinese authorities imposed strict measures to prevent the virus from being introduced into China from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all foreigners entering China.On 23 March, China had only one case reported in the previous five days and it was a passenger who had returned from Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that the spread of the virus in China was contained and the outbreak was being controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were lifted in Hubei, except Wuhan, after a two-month lockdown.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that visa-entry or work permits for China would be suspended from 28 March onwards without specifying when the restrictions would end.
Those who wish to enter China will need to apply for visas from the Chinese embassy.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and businesses to reopen on 30 March, and imposed a national day of mourning on businesses.The National Assembly initially declared a national day of mourning with a 3-minute silence beginning at 4 am on 4 April, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, but the central government asked families to post online mourning messages as they gathered to avoid further spread of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have arrived in South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The National Health Service reported a sharp increase in cases on 20 February, attributed to a meeting in Daegu of the new Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Followers of Shincheonji who traveled to Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being the cause of the outbreak.

Some artists have tried alternative ways of publishing and sharing their work via the Internet instead of the traditional live performance method, such as live streaming concerts or web-based "festivals" where artists can perform, broadcast, and promote their work.
On the internet, the news of the coronavirus has spread because many people have started to make it a joke and play between ignorance and truth.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a lot of prejudice, ethnic hatred, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, as well as people from the most affected areas of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, intimidation, and violence have been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (with most cases still in China) highlighted racial discrimination against Chinese groups worldwide that should be vaccinated or receive what is considered fair compensation.
Some African countries have also seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have said they are discriminated against because of their ethnicity.
There has been support for Chinese, online and elsewhere, and for those living in the affected areas.
As the virus spread internationally, the population of Italy, the first European country to be hit hardest by COVID-19, also became increasingly discriminated against.Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions calling for a ban on Chinese entry in an attempt to contain the outbreak.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDontComeToJapan) was a hit on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States fear further discrimination, harassment and discrimination.
Gurdwaras President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus "China virus", a term that gurdwaras have called racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus that was taking Ukrainian and foreign nationals from Wuhan to Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which is a Chinese colony, studying in major Indian cities reportedly faced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese were ruining the environment and that "it was God's punishment".
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Kolkata, who called them "a mistake".[33] In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese citizens have been overshadowed by the epidemic, with foreigners being called "foreign trash" and followed by "throwing".
Many newspapers with paid subscriptions have removed them and added information about the coronavirus in some or all of them.
Many scientific journals have made articles about the disease free.
Some scientists decided to quickly share their findings on simple websites like bioRxiv.

The test for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes both virus detection and antibody detection techniques.
The presence of the virus in the test samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test was conducted on RNA testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to identify the virus that has infected or infected a person.
Antibodies (serology) can be used to diagnose disease or to determine the number of people infected.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have been infected, including those who have had mild symptoms without needing to go to the hospital or who have no symptoms.
The exact number of deaths and the extent of the disease can be determined by this type of testing.
Due to a lack of testing, as of March 2020 no country had accurate data on the virus status of its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are significant differences in the number of people tested worldwide.
These differences may affect mortality rates, which may be high in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) this test can be performed on tissue samples obtained through a variety of techniques, including nasal and anal swabs or a sample sample.
Results are usually obtained within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests for the presence of a viral infection are reliable if performed only in the first week of the disease.
The bacteria then disappear into the lungs and multiply.
For patients who are screened in the second week, test samples may be taken from the airways with a suction catheter or a catheter may also be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in February 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which resulted in 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test system on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
This "E" gene is present in all beta coronaviruses, with the RdRp gene present only in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time-PCR Diagnostic Panel test for government testing through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in the old test kit showed results that were not conclusive due to faulty reagents, as well as a test problem at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in fewer than 100 samples a day being processed as of February 2020.
Dual-testing was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then some state and local trials had not been approved to begin testing.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization process.US clinical trials for profit began in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced that COVID-19 testing was available nationwide based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing widely available across the country as of 9 March 2020.
No limitation on quantity has been announced; collection and processing of test kits must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test kit was registered with the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a COVID-19 test.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in 3.5 hours, allowing one device to perform up to 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted early approval to Abbott Laboratories to test Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar approval to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received an emergency approval from the FDA to conduct a 45-minute test.
The FDA has conducted a trial to use isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because the test does not require temperature changes, the test can produce positive results in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States and Abbott plans to expand production to test 50,000 people a day.The test uses monoclonal antibody-based nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus being developed in Taiwan, which is expected to provide results in 15 to 20 minutes as with rapid influenza testing.
A review of the literature in March 2020 concluded that "chest imaging is not useful in the early stages, and CT [computed tomography] results may be present before symptoms become apparent".
Commonly indicated in CT are bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities as well as peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation are increasing as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan in the outbreak zone showed that CT detection was faster than PCR, although it was less accurate, with many of its images confusing pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used to diagnose or perform a primary COVID-19 test".In March 2020, the CDC had recommended PCR for use in primary tests.
One of the functions of the immune system is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect the virus in humans from 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to detect mosquitoes, and to monitor the number of infected individuals.The tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or point-of-care testing (PoCT).
High-throughput automated systems in several laboratories will be able to perform this test but its availability will depend on the quantity of each system produced.
For CLT, single-shot blood tests are usually used, although other blood can be used to monitor the circulatory system.
In PoCT, a single blood test is usually obtained by a skin biopsy.
Unlike PCR, the extraction step does not require a pre-test.As of 26 March 2020, the FDA has received 29 submissions as required and can now distribute their own antibody testing kits.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA in the emergency approval process.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in antibody samples.
They can test hundreds of samples in a matter of hours, which is faster than traditional PCR testing for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected within 14 days of exposure to the virus.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody tests it had purchased were effective.
Hong Kong has introduced a policy whereby suspected cases are kept at home, "the emergency department will provide a patient with a test kit", the patient will be tested, sent back and receive the test results later.The British NHS announced that it is testing a system to screen suspected cases at home, which will reduce the risk of patients being hospitalized or having to use an ambulance if used.In the COVID-19 test, suspected cases are diagnosed at home by a doctor, who then removes samples and follows the appropriate precautions.
Drive-through testing centers have enabled South Korea to test more people faster, more than any other country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians reported on 2 March, it could test about 12,000 people a day in the process of repatriation and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are paid by the insurance if the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to test 160,000 people a week.
19 On March 3, a self-examination was held in many major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the number of people tested in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A preliminary trial study showed that a total of 483,295 samples were tested in the week of 12/2020 up to week 12/2020, including 33,491 samples (6.9%) that were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a system that can test samples from 64 patients at once, combining samples and retesting to determine whether samples are positive for the virus.In Wuhan, a new 2,000-sq-meter-long test tube called "Huo- Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, "Fire Eye", English: Fire Eye) can be used to test more than 10,000 samples in China on or around 5 February 2020.
Construction was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, and estimates suggest that the incidence rate in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine would have doubled if the testing facility had not been built.
The Wuhan trial was quickly followed by Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in 12 cities across China.
The daily test rate was 50,000 as of 4 March 2020.[citation needed] Multiplexed designs of non-commercial tests developed by Origami Assays have been released that can test for COVID-19 in 1122 patient samples using only 93 tests.[citation needed] These tests can be used in small laboratories without the need for robotics.
By March, the shortage of drugs used in the test had become a major factor in the high cost of testing in the EU and the UK and US.
This has led some researchers to experiment with a method of preparing samples by heating them at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to produce RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was testing its population for the Coronavirus more than any other country, and aimed to increase testing to reach a wider population in the country.
This was done by combining a self-driving test facility with the purchase of a mass-test facility from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
The test, built in 14 days, is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to be operated outside China.
Different test kits targeting different coronavirus genes have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has recommended that the German company produce tests for developing countries that lack the capacity to do so.
The German vaccine was released on 17 January 2020; a version developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not released until 28 January, delaying testing in the US.China and the US had limited testing capabilities in the early stages of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to produce enough of these to meet the demand and recommendations of health professionals for testing.
In contrast, experts say that mass testing in South Korea has helped slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, especially in private laboratories, were developed decades ago by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, World Health called for increased testing programs as the most effective way to slow the spread of COVID-19.The increased need for testing due to the spread of the virus has led to a surge in testing in private clinics in the United States, and the availability of testing materials has become scarce.
In March 2020 China reported that there were problems with the accuracy of the test equipment.
In the United States, the CDC's testing kits were "problematic"; the government then removed restrictions that had prevented private clinical trials from testing.Spain purchased tests from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to failure to collect samples or use accurate tests.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the test results for the dead, and other contaminants provided to Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the tests the Czech Republic purchased from China had negative results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million tests from China which were found to be negative.
Prime Minister Matovič said that these should be dumped in the Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the tests Turkey purchased from China had "high potential for error" and "were not used".The UK purchased 3.5 million tests from China but in early April 2020 announced that these were not available for use.
Testing, followed by quarantine of the infected and tracing of those in close contact with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vò, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, conducted two rounds of tests on a total of 3,400 people, ten days apart.
Almost half of the people who tested positive for the virus had no symptoms, and all those who tested positive were placed in quarantine.
Because they were not allowed to go to people, the number of new cases of the virus was reduced.
Intensive contact tracing, denial of entry, testing, and quarantine of patients have helped to contain the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore more than in other developed countries, but without closing many stores such as grocery stores and small retailers.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to order residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the 23 March holiday.
Many other countries have also successfully managed to contain the disease through close contact tracing, entry bans, testing, and quarantine, but without the use of excessive vaccination, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have found that countries that have tested more people, compared to the number of deaths, have fewer deaths, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited testing capacity and limited COVID-19 experience submit their first five samples of COVID-19 patients and top ten live COVID-19 patients to one of the 16 WHO-designated testing sites to confirm their testing.
Of the 16 studies, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the percentage of cases tested is based on the national testing system.
A country that tests only those admitted to hospital will have a higher percentage of cases tested than a country that tests the general population, with or without symptoms, if all else remains the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap and detergent regularly at "critical times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea, which is spread through bad breath.
People can also get a cold like the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their face, nose, or mouth (i.e., cold areas).
The five most important times of the day when handwashing with soap is most necessary for work: before going to and from the toilet, after cleaning the back of the child or changing the baby's diaper, before feeding the child, before and after eating or after preparing food or handling raw meat or fish.
If soap and water are not available, wash hands with soap and soap.
Before, during, and after meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a toilet or cleaning a baby after using the toilet.
After coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, its food, or its excrement.
Medical hand hygiene is the practice of cleaning hands for medical purposes.
Washing hands before administering medication or treating someone can reduce the spread of infection.
The primary purpose of hand washing is to kill bacteria, viruses, or other germs that can cause disease and to remove toxins that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially true for people who work in the food or healthcare industry, but it is a good thing for everyone.
Hand washing has many benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other communicable diseases; avoiding contaminants; reducing the risk of infectious diseases;
and reduce child deaths in home births.
A 2013 study found that increasing handwashing habits may improve developmental outcomes in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the number of child deaths from diarrheal diseases could be reduced by making changes in behaviour, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate from these diseases by up to 50%.
The promotion of handwashing can reduce waste by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in exposure can be countered by handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent exposure to infectious diseases, as a practice in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the most common respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, killing 1.8 million children each year.
Both measles and pneumonia kill 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap and soap before and after eating a public toilet can save lives more than vaccines or treatments, reducing the number of deaths from communicable diseases by a quarter.
Handwashing is often accompanied by other hygiene activities as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) campaign.
Hand washing also reduces the risk of skin infections such as whooping cough, which is spread by direct contact.
The minor risk of washing hands regularly is the skin rash.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause skin rashes, eczema, or hand dermatitis, a common medical condition.
Washing hands too often is also seen as a symptom of a recurrent phobia disorder, known as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five main times of day when handwashing and soaping are important to reduce the risk of oral infection: after using the toilet (breathing, washing), after cleaning the baby (changing the nappies), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat or fish.
Other situations in which proper hand washing is necessary to prevent the spread of disease include before or after touching a cat or cat; after coughing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or animal waste; and after handling garbage.
In many lands, handwashing with soap is rare.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that on average, 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap and water.A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest handwashing rate at 97%, the United States was in the middle with 77% and China was at the bottom with 23%.There are now many behavioural changes to increase the practice of handwashing with soap and water in times of crisis.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is one example of a program to promote the health and education of children.
The use of pesticides twice a year, including hand washing with soap and water daily, brushing daily with fluoride, are among the requirements of the national policy.
This arrangement was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removing the bacteria from the skin is supplemented by adding soap to the water.
The main function of soap is to reduce water resistance, making it easier to soak.
Water alone cannot cleanse the skin because fat and protein, which are part of the natural makeup of the soil, are not dissolved in water.
Instead, the cleaning is done with the help of flowing water.
Recycled soap may retain bacteria from previous use.
A few studies on the transport of bacteria from the soap in the bottle have shown that the bacteria are difficult to transport because they travel through the lungs.
The CDC also states that "soap and water that is not washed is the best".
Health-conscious people are strongly encouraged to use antibacterial soaps.
At present, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or disinfectants kills bacteria.
Instead, disinfectant soaps contain antibiotics such as triclosan, which contains many antibiotics.
Thus, antibiotics are not a substitute for antibiotic soap, and they may not work as well as they are supposed to.
In addition to the skin-protective ingredient, various products may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin softeners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A major study from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that regular soap works as well as traditional soap containing triclosan in preventing infection and eliminating germs from the hands.
Hot water, which can be used to wash hands, is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria grow most rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
Instead, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing soil contaminants and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water does not reduce the number of germs on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a solid such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) added to make the ointment, or a humectant such as glycerin to make the liquid, or a solvent to make it easier for users to use and reduce the alcohol's viscosity.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases its disinfection capacity.Hand sanitizers with alcohol content of at least 60 to 95% are effective at killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (3.5 log reduction, compared to 35 decibel reduction) on the hands after 30 seconds of use and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of use.Hand sanitizers are effective against bacteria but less effective against certain viruses.
Hand sanitizers made from alcohol are almost completely immune to norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, which is the most common cause of gastroenteritis.Hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to soak or rub both hands.
The front of each finger and the back of each finger are rubbed together for about 30 seconds until the water, mucus, or pus have settled.
Hand sanitizer should also be washed thoroughly, with both hands rubbed together.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using sanitizer, especially when hands appear dirty.
The increased use of these products is based on their ease of use and quick disinfection; however, they should not replace the practice of proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizers can irritate the skin unless combined with moisturizers and/or skin softeners.
Skin irritation can be reduced or eliminated by adding a disinfectant or other skin conditioner.
In medical studies, alcohol-based sanitizers combined with skin creams caused less skin irritation than soap or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or allergic reactions to alcohol or alcohol-based sanitizers are rare.
The less likely cause of skin irritation (irritant contact dermatitis) attracted attention when compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Although effective, hand sanitizers that are not made of water do not clean quickly, they only kill germs.
This is why sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in fighting the spread of many germs, as germs remain on the hands.
Non-alcoholic sanitizers are highly dependent on the ingredients, and historically have been less effective than alcohol-based sanitizers.
Recently, products using benzalkonium chloride have been found to be more effective at killing bacteria and viruses when used, than alcohol, which has been found to be less effective with each use, possibly due to its skin damage.
Many people in developing countries cannot afford soap, so they use ashes and dirt.
Dust or dirt may be more effective than plain water, but it may not be as effective as soap.
The problem is that contaminated soil or dust can increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, soot is a disinfectant because it combines with water to form an alkaline solution.
WHO has recommended using ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
Proper hand washing recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease includes the following steps:
Do not wash your hands with hot or cold water while walking.
The flowing water is recommended because the water that does not flow can be contaminated with bacteria, and the temperature of the water does not make a difference.
Wash your hands with soap and detergent, especially under the fingers, on the palms, and under the nails.
Soap cleanses the skin of bacteria, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more often with soap than with plain water.
I'll be there in about 20 seconds.
Washing hands causes them to rub together, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and waiting longer removes more germs.
I am well-suited to the flow of water.
Soaking it in stagnant water can re-infect the hands.
Wash your hands with a dry towel or leave them alone.
Dirty hands are prone to infection, and the most commonly forgotten areas are the gutter, the sink, the gutter, and the stomach.
Hunger is a serious condition that can hide germs.
Soft masks are recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can cause skin injuries which can increase the risk of infection.
There are many other methods that can be used to wash hands when tap water or soap is not available to try to flush water from a hanging jar or a sink and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water is scarce (such as schools or villages in developing countries), there are initiatives to reduce water use, such as "tippy-taps" and other less expensive methods.
Tippy-tap is a simple procedure that uses a tap attached to a cord, which is placed on the person's arm to hold a small amount of water and then rubbed on the hands with a soap bubble.
Proper hand washing is an important part of hand hygiene, but there is some disagreement about the best way to wash hands in a public toilet.
Numerous studies have shown that paper towels are more efficient than the many electrical detergents found in a toilet.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene effects of using paper towels, hot-air hand sanitizers, and new jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and disinfection with warm air, the number of bacteria was found to increase on the hands by 194% and on the face by 254%.
Washing hands in a ventilated environment led to a 42% increase in bacteria on the hands and 15% on the cheeks.
After hand washing and paper towel use, the number of bacteria on the hands was reduced by 76% and on the face by 77%.Scientists also conducted tests to determine the ability of toilet users to prevent the spread of germs and the condition of the toilet area caused by different types of hand washing.
The high-pressure air purifier, which blows at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), could expel germs from the hands and the stomach and could infect other toilet users and spread them to the toilet within 2 meters of the toilet.
Using a hot air balloon blew the germs away from the target by 0.25 meters.
Paper towels did not show any potential for the transmission of germs.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined various hand sanitizer methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after hand washing were found:
There are many hand washing companies, and hand washing has been compared to hand washing with paper towels.
Hand washing with soft paper is used for walking without soap and water.
Alcohol-containing sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing became a popular method of prevention long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis proved its effectiveness (in 1846).
There are machines in hospitals that remind staff to wash their hands if they forget.
Some studies have found that the risk of infection decreases with the use of electronic devices.
Washing hands for disinfection should last at least 15 minutes, using enough soap and water to soften and protect each area of the hand.
The fingers should be placed together with the corresponding fingers.
If there is a contaminant in the food, a small amount of rubber can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in hand-washed water, it is important to stir it thoroughly and rinse it with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to seal the water (and remove the water outlet if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting infected again.
The purpose of hand washing in a hospital setting is to remove germs and prevent their spread.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, unwashed hands remain a major problem in many hospitals, with many doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before handling patients, leading to a high risk of infection.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple measures can reduce the risk of blood-borne infections by 66 percent compared to intravenous injections.The World Health Organization published a paper recommending hand washing and finger-washing in hospitals.
The manual for hand washing of the department can also be found on its website for public reference.
A careful study was made by Whitby and his associates.
There are machines that can measure and verify the cleanliness, if necessary to ensure compliance with legal requirements.
The World Health Organization has defined "Five Principles" for hand washing:
after touching blood/body fluid
I'm going to touch something that's not contaminated, and
After handling a patient: Using a medicated or antimicrobial soap helps to kill bacteria.
Disinfection may be required before surgery or in the most severe cases when the bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. Hand washing before surgery requires removable tape, washing with chlorhexidine or iodine, a towel to wash hands after bathing, and a towel to clean the stomach.
All the dirt must be removed.
This activity requires washing hands and the area of the hands to the ankles, for 26 minutes.
Washing hands for long periods (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When shaking, the water from the hands should not get on your hands.
After hand washing, the hands are washed with a clean cloth and the cloth is cleaned and cleaned.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is recommended to wash hands or use disinfectant before and after touching a patient.
To prevent staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of handwashing was found to be 20% of the first batch of batches, and the smallest benefit of handwashing increased by more than 35%.
Washing with soap and detergent increases the risk of foodborne illness by more than three times compared to washing with soap and detergent.A comparison of hand washing with alcohol-based hand sanitizer and hand washing with soap and detergent for 30 drops each showed that hand washing with alcohol-based hand sanitizer reduced bacteria by 26% compared to soap and detergent.
However, soap and water are more effective than detergent and alcohol-containing sanitizer in reducing the spread of H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands.Measures to promote hand hygiene in hospitals may include handwashing training, increased use of alcohol-containing sanitizers, and written or oral reminders to staff.
There is a need for further research to determine which of these practices is most effective in different clinical settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is seen as a cost-saving, health-promoting, and nutritionally beneficial practice.
However, the lack of water, soap or handwashing equipment in private homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge in spreading and promoting the practice of handwashing everywhere.
For example, in rural parts of Africa most hand-washing tapes are scarce next to any public or private toilet, despite cheap methods of constructing hand washing facilities.
However, hand washing is also a habit that can be a long-standing habit rather than a lack of soap and water.
Advertising and promoting handwashing with soap can change the public's mindset, educate people about the benefits of handwashing and change lifestyle habits.
But to do this effectively, monitoring and monitoring people's actions is essential.
Over 70 studies have found that community-based approaches in developing countries (LMICs) are effective in encouraging handwashing; instead, they are a marketing campaign and not a practical one.An example of school handwashing is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach"; this approach involves encouraging schools to use simple and inexpensive methods to encourage students to wash their hands with soap, as part of their hygiene requirements.
Once the basic standard is reached, schools can go from one star to three stars.
Providing handwashing facilities can be part of a campaign to reduce childhood disease and mortality.
Global Handwashing Day is also a good example of how to encourage change in behaviour.Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF created an online campaign to encourage people to wash their hands.
There are a few studies that have examined the financial impact of handwashing in developing countries compared to the DALYs averaged.
However, some studies suggest that the promotion of handwashing with soap and detergent is far superior to other methods of water and sanitation.
The importance of hand washing to human health, especially for people in emergency situations such as pregnant women or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis of the Vienna Clinic and by Florence Nightingale, the English "father of modern medicine".
At the time, it was thought that disease was caused by a fungus called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne illnesses and infectious diseases led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shut down and educate the public about the importance of handwashing to prevent the spread of disease.
The outbreaks of swine flu in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2020 have led many countries to recognise the importance of handwashing with soap to prevent the spread of diseases such as those mentioned above.
For example, signs with the words "clean handwashing tips" have been hung on the laundry facilities of public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing one's hands" means to announce that one is free from responsibility or involvement.
The phrase is found in the Bible account in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washes his hands before deciding the impalement of Jesus Christ; however, the phrase is now commonly used in parts of England.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash her hands while trying to think of the court she is contemplating, symbolizing the guilt she feels for the crimes she has committed and causing her husband to miss the time.
It has also been found that when people recall or reflect on past bad experiences, they wash their hands more often than others, and they are more likely to respect hand sanitizers than they were before.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after thinking so have few chances of ever again engaging in hygiene activities such as philanthropy.
The beliefs encourage hand washing for both personal and symbolic hygiene. The use of hand washing, which is the use of water without soap to wash the hands, is a common practice in several religions, including Bahai, Hindu, Tevilah and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hindu, Jewish and Islamic beliefs encourage hand washing after using the toilet.
Also, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims recommend washing one's hands before and after eating.
Limitations on workplace challenges caused by COVID-19
The restrictions on workplace exposure due to COVID-19 include the introduction of safety measures and measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Effective occupational hazard prevention practices depend on the location of the work and the challenge is based on an assessment of the source of the hazard, the severity of the community health crisis, and the risk of exposure to individual workers who are at high risk for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have few interactions with the workplace and other workers, and such interactions can be addressed with minimal primary care, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory practices, and regular workplace hygiene and disinfection efforts.
Low-risk occupations include those that involve close contact with people who are unknown or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be at risk of contracting the disease due to local spread or international travel.
These include those who work in public places, such as schools, workplaces, and shopping malls.
Such prevention includes the use of preventive measures, including the use of air purifiers and wearing protective clothing if a COVID-19 patient is nearby.
OSHA's policy is to treat doctors/nurses in suspected COVID-19 treatment facilities as high-risk, and the risk increases when the personnel have samples taken from a dead or suspected COVID-19 victim.
Measures to prevent these workers include building techniques, such as ventilation, and physical protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a wide range of effects on the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of contracting the disease.
The market can change, depending on what people want and how they want it (e.g. buying at the peak of the season or wanting to be delivered or staying in the stores).
Finally, the movement of goods from COVID-19-affected areas may be disrupted.Epidemic preparedness and response is needed to help guide prevention efforts.
The plans address risk factors that affect the various workplaces and the workplace itself, including the effects of infectious diseases, family and community risk, and other risk factors such as age or chronic illness.
They establish the necessary restrictions to deal with the risks, and a plan to prevent the possible outbreak of disease.
Preparedness for infectious diseases may depend on national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of disease control include reducing the spread of disease among workers, protecting people at risk of serious complications, maintaining the flow of activity, and reducing the impact on business partners in their service area.
The epidemic in the business community is affecting the way it is managed.
Risk management is a widely used method in the world to manage workplace and personal risk by classifying strategies based on their effectiveness.
Where the COVID-19 crisis cannot be contained, prevention is more effective than engineering controls, which are preceded by administrative controls and lastly by individual controls.
Engineering controls involve removing workers from the labor-related stresses without relying on work ethic and are generally less expensive to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work practices or work processes that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than the initial engineering or management but can help prevent infection.
All PPE should be selected for the risks to the worker, be stored in appropriate places (e.g. when washed), worn at all times and in good condition, checked regularly, maintained, repaired, disposed of as necessary, cleaned, stored or discarded to avoid infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have few contacts with outside workers.
Basic practices recommended for all workplaces include hand washing and hygiene, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, good coughing or sneezing habits including covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing, distributing sanitary pads and sanitary pads, being prepared to communicate by telephone or exchange work if necessary, encouraging employees not to use other tools, and regularly cleaning the workplace and trying to disinfect.
Early detection and isolation of suspected patients helps to save workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until their malaria has subsided, that they have no symptoms of malaria or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking anti-malarial medication, and that retirement policies should be flexible, that employees be allowed to stay home to care for patients, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, low-risk occupations are those that require people to stay within 1.8 meters (1.8 feet) of people who are not known to have or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the local area of the business or because the person has traveled abroad to a known COVID-19 affected area.
These include workers who are in contact with other people such as schools, crowded workplaces, and crowded shopping malls.Engineering controls for these areas and high-risk groups include installing air-tight enclosures on buildings, increasing the size of the walls, creating more than enough walls to attract people when they hit the road, and opening a window to alert workers that they will be unable to get out of the building without a warning.Administrative controls at workplace sites are designed to encourage workers to use safety nets to protect themselves from the elements, to use safety equipment to protect themselves from the elements, to use safety equipment to protect workers from COVID-19, to provide information to workers and other workers who may need to be in contact with other workers, to provide information on how to get to work, to use safety equipment, to communicate with workers, to provide information about COVID-19 and to use the Internet to prevent people from getting infected, to provide information about the situation, to use the Internet to communicate with employees, to provide information about the situation, to use the Internet to protect themselves and others who may be affected by COVID-19.
Workers in this group do not usually need to use respirators.
When someone becomes ill on a flight, the best ways to prevent staff and passengers from getting hurt include keeping the sick person within 6 feet of others, having a staff member look after the sick person, giving the sick person a toothpick or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with a toilet paper when coughing or sneezing.
Airline employees should wear disposable gloves when handling sick passengers or when touching body fluids or other items that appear to be contaminated, and should cover themselves if a person on duty appears to have a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biohazard bag, and the items must be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.Cargo ships, including passenger ships, are at risk of these hazards, including extended sick leave, quarantine and notifying the ship's crew if you experience fever or other symptoms on board.
In fact, the CDC recommends that the patient be monitored in the patient's room, and that schools and daycare centers temporarily close to allow for the disinfection of the area if the patient is in the school building, even if the area is not contaminated.
If there is a community outbreak of contagious disease, isolation measures may be used, such as cancelling visits, queuing at school, and other large gatherings such as gyms or school dinners, increasing the number of seats, adjusting the time of arrival and departure of children, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a special health office for children with symptoms of influenza.
In the event of a severe outbreak in the community, it is advisable to extend the school closure to extend the social distancing measures.For security guards who are engaged in daily activities, the risk of infection is considered by the CDC to be very low.
Security guards who have been in close contact with people who have been confirmed to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the same procedures as emergency medical personnel, including the use of full body masks.
In case of contact with an infected person, workers should clean and disinfect their clothing before reusing it with household spray or aerosol, and follow common procedures for cleaning and washing clothes.
OSHA considers some healthcare workers and warehouse workers to be at a higher risk of infection.
The most high-risk occupations include home care, support, laboratory workers, and healthcare workers who are in close contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These are at particular risk when workers engage in aerosol-generating procedures on patients, or when they touch samples from known or suspected COVID-19 subjects.
Aerosol-generating procedures include coughing, bronchoscopies, dental procedures, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk occupations involve the preparation of the bodies of people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these are at high risk when conducting autopsies.Engineering controls on these high-risk populations include the use of isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, which include aerosol-generating procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be useful in some medical conditions such as postmortem.
Samples taken from humans should be handled with extreme caution (Biosafety Level 3 precautions).
WHO recommends that new cases be isolated and quarantined if they are suspected of COVID-19.In addition to other PPE procedures, OSHA recommends the use of personal protective equipment for those working within 6 feet of SARS-CoV-2 patients or suspected cases and those working on aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, N95 masks approved by NIOSH or higher should be used in a well-organized environment including pre-testing, user training, training, and clinical testing.
Other types of respirators can be more effective in keeping workers active.WHO does not recommend using respirators because COVID-19 is an infectious disease and is not transmitted through the body's natural fluid.
WHO authorizes the use of surgical masks for inpatient care.
For those who collect respiratory samples from humans, care for, or transport COVID-19 patients without using aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of a surgical mask, a face mask, and gloves.
During the aerosol-generating procedure, the mask is covered with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Due to the inadequacy of personal protective equipment (PPE), WHO recommends reducing the use of personal protective equipment in telemedicine, using devices such as illuminated windows, allowing only healthcare professionals to directly access the room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the personal protective equipment necessary for the procedure, using a single protective cover when treating patients with a specific disease, monitoring and sharing of medical information, and not allowing the use of masks for asymptomatic patients.

We are in a difficult situation this month.
The COVID-19 outbreak has made it clear that all people in the world are connected and live together and each has a responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for this challenge, but we know that our response depends on the global sympathy, friendship, and cooperation among the peoples upon which this institution is built.
The kindness and concern we have seen in our colleagues in emails, phone calls, and phone conversations is a clear indication that our people are compassionate and we are blessed to be with them.
I can't thank my friends enough.
Last week, someone thanked me for our work.
It reminded me of the importance of the world running to Wikipedia today, that it is also a strong sign that Wikipedia is valuable and worth keeping online for everyone to share.
Your work makes it possible for us to achieve this success, by helping to maintain a website, by helping to pay our employees or people to live in a safe environment.
Today, the world needs Wikipedia information more than ever.
It is when we see that our actions and the way we act have a real impact on the world.
Because of the value of this dedication and your work in this regard, we will be making some adjustments in our work schedule beginning next week.
Flexible work and schedule
As Robyn said earlier, the committee met last night to discuss our strategy and our plan for the coming days and months.
In our talk, we discussed what we think is the best way to prepare for the challenges ahead and the best way to keep the organization running today.
We both wanted to escape the pressure and support our mission for a long time.
If you want to call again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and temporary workers:
we were expected to work four hours a day or 20 hours a week until we moved again.
We have not announced a holiday  if you can work more than those hours, the agency can hire you.
However, the world is now a chaotic place, and whether we want to care for a loved one, buy household appliances, or go to the doctor, our health is our main concern.
We're not going to monitor your time.
DO NOT work when you are sick.
We should not have discussed this, but we felt it was appropriate.
No need for sick leave or paid absences  inform your manager and help your colleagues to make changes to your schedule to ensure that all schedules are met.
(If you are tested positive for COVID-19, notify Bryan at T&amp;C Ops so T&amp;C can provide you with the necessary support and will make sure you are safe and receive the necessary support from our administration).
Full-time workers will be paid full-time.
We have already mentioned, and we reiterate here that we will respect the commitments we make to our contractors and our hourly employees.
Each person will be paid according to his normal hours under normal circumstances.
This includes checking when you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to escape from the pressures of society/the environment.
Especially in times like these is our work satisfying and productive.
I answer here that it is up to you to take care of yourself.
We ask that you speak to your employer about what we can expect and make adjustments as necessary.
Some jobs are considered to be very important.
Some things are not meant to be.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Wellbeing, and recruitment teams (etc.) perform various functions that require additional support.
We will begin a campaign to examine our motives now and to adjust our focus now so that we can support the main activities.
We have a lot to do, and we need to focus on the more important projects.
Slowing down will not affect our future.
We don't plan to double our working hours by paying for our losses and then get back on track.
Do not expect to work more hours than you normally do because of a salary that is beyond your means.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will adjust our goals and our income as necessary.
What will be done with the Annual Plan?
To change our lifestyle, we expect to work in the normal daily schedule, we expect to change the days of the lease to achieve the goals of our 2020-2021 Year Plan.
Our goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 schedule to give us more time to work on the budget so that employees can prioritize their core tasks, care for themselves, their family and also take care of those who want to work less time in the next few weeks.
This increase significantly reduces the work schedule and provides for the completion of current work throughout the department.
We will present our proposals to the Governing Body next week and inform the members and others of our recommendations once we have approved them.
Thank you all for the planning and leadership in all matters.
Office environment, cleaning and maintenance
Last week, we were informed that a friend in San Francisco appears to have been infected with COVID-19.
Instead, with great care, we obtained disinfectant and sprayed the entire space and equipment in the San Francisco office.
They used disinfectant to disinfect everything, from the elevator poles to the floor of our office.
The owners of the building also used their own methods to care for their workers.
We feel at ease that the office will be in order when we decide to return to work.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, and the center has informed us of its COVID-19 response plan and all staff members have implemented the plan.
At the end of last week, our DC office was moved to a more remote location following the guidance of San Francisco.
And as some of our NYC friends know, we've been dating and renting a place in Brooklyn.
This courtship is ongoing but can be challenged.
Some of our friends work from home for the first time.
Some of our longtime colleagues recognize the challenge, and they would like to offer some suggestions:
Keep the mixture for an hour or two.
If longer meetings are needed, look for ways to reschedule them to different dates.
Each committee should discuss matters, prepare recommendations, and serve out the information that needs to be read in advance.
Video is a priority using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to help facilitate this conversation.
Have a chairperson for each meeting, someone to oversee the discussions and questions and give time and to monitor the speakers and someone to make recommendations (or agree on a common action).
If you need a hearing aid, email the technicians to get you a good hearing aid.
Use the money returned to the disabled person's health.
Join the #remoties in Slack and chat with your colleagues about tasks
The Department of Human Resources is looking into webinar-based ergonomics guidance to assist with the tasks assigned to the Department.
In the past week, we have asked our funders to suspend all Wikimedia-funded events such as editathons, until the WHO announces that the deadline has passed.
We explained that we understood that asking for cancellations and restrictions would make it difficult to carry out certain scheduled tasks and that no one would be penalized for delaying completion or changing schedules.
In the coming week, we will follow up on other inspirations on Wikimania and the language courses and those from other regions.
What we see most in our community is that our community is saddened by this kind of abuse but also shudders when they realize that they have to focus on their community, Wikimedia, etc.
In the future, CRT will work continuously to create a Meta-Wiki site to allow people to track their interactions and follow our communications with them.
Staying in touch on COVID-19 related issues
We will invite you through your calendars to the special meeting next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share another topic, answer your questions and spend a few moments chatting.
We are all in this together, and we all need to help one another as much as possible.
In the meantime, you can find this information on email and other COVID-19 related information sites, as well as on the Office Wiki.
CRT will endeavour to keep the latest available information in one place.
We also work to maintain regular contact with staff in the most affected countries at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, events, any work or challenges with your work, or any other matter you need help with, please feel free to contact us and CRT.
We are ready to assist and cooperate with you on the necessary matter.
If you have confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
All these changes should not seem to displace our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they help us to appreciate that our present roles and responsibilities may be different from those of the past.
We believe that these are necessary to support one another in carrying on our work, to support our organization in any way necessary, and to serve the people and the ministry on which it depends.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us at the right time.
In the meantime, it is wise to cooperate and to make time for the important tasks that lie ahead in the weeks and months ahead.
We all need to make this happen, so we all need to take care of ourselves and our families so that we can be in good health when we need it.
Now, say  in your hand and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other leaders (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein that binds to the surface (surface of cells) of the liver, muscles, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by decreasing the amount of angiotensin-II by increasing Ang (((1-7) to make it a potential drug for heart disease. ACE2 also acts as a precursor to the entry into immunity of some coronaviruses.
In humans this gene is often called hACE2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene contains a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of blood cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein consists of the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 crosses the skin at once, with its main components appearing on the surface of the immune system in the joints and other tissues.
The surface of ACE2 is removed from the skin and transported to a substance called sheddase, which then transfers the resulting protein to the bloodstream and then to the urine.
ACE2 is found in most tissues: ACE2 binds to the skin cells, especially type II lymphocytes, on the walls of the lungs, small intestine, arteries and veins, and nerve cells in most tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the membrane lining the brain, spinal cord, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to regulate ACE
ACE is bound to angiotensin I hormone in vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 is then bound to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is released into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind to a variety of neurotransmitters including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is suspected to be a factor in Hartnup's disease.
As a skin-transmitted protein, ACE2 acts as a key gateway to immunity for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-causing virus).
In particular, the attachment of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the major ACE2 gene on the cell surface causes the virus and genes to be moved from their original location back into the cell walls.
This entry also requires the S protein to be cleaved with the serine protease TMPRSS2, whose release is being studied for clinical use.This has led some to speculate that reducing the ACE2 level in cells may help fight infection.
However, various research institutions and regulatory agencies support the continued use of ACE inhibitors known as ARB therapies.
A comprehensive review of the results of a clinical trial published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was 34 percent more effective in reducing the risk of pneumonia than other prescribed drugs
And, "the risk of pneumonia decreased in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with heart disease
Use of ACE inhibitors has also been thought to reduce the mortality rate of pneumonia, although the effects were not as severe as the risk of pneumonia"
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be the emerging treatment for acute respiratory distress, and was found to improve nerve congestion and respiratory circulation in young mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The reduction of rhACE2 in humans takes 10 hours and the onset of activity is 30 minutes with a duration of action (duration of action) of 24 hours.
Results from several studies suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for those who are intolerant to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with enhanced angiotensin II transport.Infused rhACE2 is being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help track contacts in the fight against the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, i.e. a system to identify people (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various apps have been developed or recommended, with official government support in various regions and provinces.
Various methods for building apps that track contacts and patients have been developed.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially with apps based on tracking users' location.
Other low-cost methods include using Bluetooth waves to connect a user's phone to a nearby device
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would collaborate to support a Bluetooth-like app for Android and iOS directly on their mobile devices.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipau, has developed an app that allows its citizens to test for COVID-19 if they have been in contact with people.
It is used in over 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by local IT community, and is available for public use and will be provided by the government.North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth app to track participants and suspected cases and to quickly send information to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is yet to be confirmed by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that a contact tracing app was in the final stages of development, and would be ready to go live in a few weeks.A similar app is being developed in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering tracing Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to launch a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they stay home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, identified potential problems with app-based systems, including the perceived efficiency and potential for performance impairment when the app is used for human computation.
To address the issue of new or potentially dangerous coronavirus apps, Apple has restricted which companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, allowing only those that are from established or established companies.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the potential impact of tracking large numbers of coronavirus users, particularly questioning whether the tracking built to address the issue of privacy will be disrupted once the pandemic is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a petition calling for a ban on this type of surveillance.
The agencies announced eight restrictions on government projects:
supervision must be legal, necessary and proportionate;
the continuation of supervision and supervision shall include an undertaking stating when it will end;
The information will be used only in relation to COVID-19;
The father's protection and privacy must be protected and this must be confirmed by a witness;
electronic surveillance should avoid further propagating issues of discrimination and discrimination;
sharing information with others must be prohibited by law;
there should be measures to prevent violations of human rights and the right of citizens to defend themselves against discrimination;
"comprehensive" intervention by all "victims" will be required, including by social workers and target groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published guidelines.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of unnecessary tracking by removing the tracking system from their devices when it is not necessary.
Some countries have used mobile phones to track someone's location in an app, avoid downloading apps and the ability to avoid being tracked.
In Israel, cell phone surveillance is allowed.
Mobile phone tracking systems that provide location information are a serious threat to privacy.
However, not all networks with shared servers need to have a location-based access code; several privacy-preserving networks have been set up with shared servers used for internal communication.
In South Korea, a non-app-based network was used to track contacts with infected people
Instead of using a standalone app, the network collected data from various sources including tracking mobile phone messages and contact card information, combined them into a text message and sent via email to people suspected of having been infected.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, government and local information is publicly available to everyone, which was made possible by changes to the quarantine policy following the outbreak of MERS in the country.
The information is available to the public through various apps and websites. Countries including Germany have considered using a shared network with privacy protections.
As of 6 April 2020, the official release date has not yet been announced.
Tracking contacts is a well-established practice, with several studies conducted since 2013. On 7 April 2020, several teams of experts worked on improving privacy practices, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to determine the user's location based on other mobile phones.
The PEPP-PT is a collaborative protocol with a common protocol and a common set of rules, including the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, also known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and the Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT).
Under these laws, the person's vital signs are not removed from the device, and any contact is made immediately.
The Twekisize team at the MIT Media Lab has developed SafePaths, a system known for using anonymity techniques in research and using a site or network to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research from the report "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar platform is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company formerly based at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace develops a secure technology that allows users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and administrators, without compromising privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the international TCN Coalition was formed by a coalition of groups using a common approach and common rules, with the aim of reducing the number of groups, and to be able to collaborate on the development of tracking and messaging apps, a key factor in facilitating the integration of more people.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it was implementing the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a new contact tracking system, which they said would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography.
They also published a breakthrough in the use of chemical fertilizers.
According to Apple and Google, the app is expected to be released in three phases:
to publish measures to allow the government to develop an app for coronavirus monitoring agencies while keeping the information confidential.
directly integrate this feature into iOS and Android systemsGoogle and Apple to solve the problem of allowing and tracking endlessly by first sharing the app through the mobile app activation, then and later removing it once the threat is over.
Drug repositioning (also called drug reuse, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the re-use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or condition than the one originally intended.
This is one of the many ongoing scientific studies to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other ongoing research includes the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 contains 66 different immunoglobulin-containing proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites helps in the development of antibodies to COVID-19 proteins.
The main proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. investigated a number of compounds with the aim of evaluating the development of the best-case drug that was recommended to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical trial before recommending it for clinical trials.

A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine that is believed to fight the 2019 pandemic (COVID-19).
Of course, no vaccine has passed the clinical trial period, and there are several attempts to develop such a vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, WHO said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be on the market in less than 18 months.
The vaccine was the first in a Phase I trial to test for the potential risks in April.
COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019.
A severe outbreak spread worldwide in 2020, prompting massive investment in research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomic data to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The study was launched on Thursday, the requirements of the CEPI vaccine development program are speed, capacity, production of the drug in the required quantities and worldwide distribution.
On Thursday, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were undergoing research and development by early 2020 to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
The main sources of data for Phase I risk assessment include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Developer of Phase I and lead vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and targeted drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported to CEPI scientists in May, 115 targeted vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which were confirmed as ongoing projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more were announced, but with insufficient clear data (presumably still in development or testing).
Phase I-II trials are primarily risk assessments and clinical trials, with pilot monitoring, and involve the use of a drug, conducted at multiple sites, as appropriate, to determine the most effective doses.
Phase III trials involve multiple participants and a comparative trial group to test the effectiveness of a drug against disease, as they monitor for adverse effects from the use of the highest dose.
Of the 79 targeted vaccines under development (approved in early April 2020), 74 have not yet reached human trials (still in "preclinical trials").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it would investigate the feasibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that could alter the genetic sequence of viral proteins to resuscitate the mosquito.

On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
an mRNA-based vaccine targeting BNT162, which is currently undergoing early clinical trials and is expected to commence in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company announced that it would conduct a preclinical trial before April 2020 and that its targeted vaccine could begin human trials in September.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced that it had committed US$4.9 million to a COVID-19 vaccine research partnership involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, putting CEPI's total funding for COVID-19 vaccine research at US$29 million.
Other CEPI funds for the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of a five-stage vaccine.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are working on developing a vaccine based on self-amplifying RNA to vaccinate against COVID-19.
A targeted vaccine was developed in 14 days after receiving samples from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced it had committed C$275 million to fund 96 COVID-19 research projects, including targeted vaccines at companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with the aim of creating a unique vaccine library to be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine published a report on the trial of PittCoVacc, a vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, stating that "MNA has isolated a subset of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine from a highly active [mice] antibody that was detected starting 2 weeks after vaccination".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced a DNA-based vaccine; they said it could be used by inhalation.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be synthesized by mimicking the human body's own bacteria to produce a virus-like but non-toxic DNA, which can suppress the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, three industries, and universities selected IBM's cloud computing products, plus cloud computing products from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
One vaccine has a number of side effects, some of which are known to be unknown.
This means it can be more effective in preventing disease onset.
Another randomized trial in Australia sought to enroll 4,170 nurses.
It is possible that the current vaccines will be harmful or even ineffective.
The first studies to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines using specific animals infected with COVID-19, including ACE2-resistant vaccines, other experimental animals, and other animals, highlight the need for biosafety-level 3 prevention measures to address health risks, and global collaboration to ensure safety.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animals.
As of 2020, there is no known safe and effective cure or vaccine for SARS in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development and development of a new vaccine and treatment for SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS first became widely available, it was thought that current research on SARS could provide useful insights into the development of a vaccine and treatment for MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was only one single-dose (DNA-based) vaccine that had passed Phase I human clinical trials, and three more were under development, collectively known as viral-vectored vaccines, two of which were adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
There are rumors circulating on social media that the COVID-19 virus was already known and that a vaccine had already been developed.
The findings reported by various media outlets refer to the current developments in the development of a vaccine for the treatment and prevention of other coronavirus-related diseases such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include nausea, mouth pain, runny nose, diarrhea, difficulty in smelling, and abdominal pain.
The time from infection to onset of symptoms is usually about five days but can vary between two and fourteen days.
Of course, most patients with mild symptoms have severe pneumonia and some have permanent paralysis.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mainly transmitted from close to one another, mainly through a toilet that is touched, touched, or spoken.
Yes, a person's breathing causes a boil, often on the ground or on objects, and it does not affect people who are far away.
People can also become infected by touching infected areas of the face, nose, or mouth.
The virus can remain on a surface for up to 72 hours.
It is usually injected within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although injecting can occur without symptoms even in the later stages of the disease.The most commonly used technique is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) by removing a sample from a sample.
It is recommended to use vaccines on suspected infected persons and their caregivers.
The use of masks is recommended in public, while some authorities prohibit, some recommend and others mandate their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Internal outbreaks of the disease have been observed in many different countries in the WHO's six regional units.
Those infected may not have symptoms or may not experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain or tightness, confusion, difficulty moving and swallowing; it is wise to seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms persist.
Rare symptoms include upper respiratory symptoms such as vomiting, runny nose or runny nose.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as shortness of breath, vomiting and diarrhoea have been reported at varying rates.
At first, some patients in China experience a heavy feeling in the chest and a stiffness in the throat.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and even death.
This is called the "birth period".
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually between five and six days but can be longer, ranging from two to 14 days.
97.5% of cases develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all cases show symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic agents in the transmission of disease is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary data suggest that they may be capable of transmitting disease.
The prevalence of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown and is still being investigated, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of patients who were vaccinated did not show symptoms at the time of their hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began counting asymptomatic cases among daily patients on 1 April; of 166 patients on that day, 130 (78%) patients had no symptoms at the time of diagnosis.
The sputum of a person may contain a host of germs.
Shouting out loud is more effective than talking out loud.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth causes a person to vomit a 15 foot (4.5 m) hole.
Although the virus is not generally transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences says that bioaerosol transmission is possible and that air bags outside people's homes have been tested for RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may contain airborne microorganisms that cause airborne diseases.
Of course, there is a fear that the disease may spread through the malice of the virus, which is thought to be a minor risk.The virus is most commonly transmitted when patients show symptoms; although the symptoms are not obvious, the risk is small.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although the speed of transmission of disease is not clear, it is usually transmitted from one person to two or three others.
In particular, the virus has been shown to survive a day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and non-woven materials (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% cotton.
Rather, this time varies according to the temperature of the well.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used properly; they protect the skin from infection, soften the skin, and remove any stains.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a disinfectant used in surgery), are not effective.In a Hong Kong study, wax samples were taken from people within two days of being admitted to bed.
Of the six patients, the first sample showed a high level of bacteria and the sixth patient showed a high level of bacteria on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first identified in three cases of pneumonia in response to a severe respiratory illness in patients in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in all anti-coronavirus viruses in the genus.
When the virus is outside the body by contact with soap, the soap absorbs the fluid from the virus that is outside.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are most vulnerable to COVID-19 because the virus enters the circulatory system via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed mainly in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special membrane glycoprotein called a "spine" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the cell it infects.
Acute cardiac arrest was found in 12% of hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and is common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high, due to systemic inflammatory response and problems in the coronary artery during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A risk of blood clots (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in COVID-19 patients requiring specialized treatment and may contradict misconceptions.Autopsies of COVID-19 deaths have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), a blood clot in the veins.
Although SARS-COV-2 is active on the ACE2-containing epithelial cells of the spleen, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have been detected in autopsies.
WHO publishes a research programme on many of these diseases.
The most common test is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on samples taken from the urine and collected with a urine swab; however a nasal swab or a swab can also be used.
Results are usually obtained within a few hours to two days.
Careful testing can also be used but the samples should be taken in pairs within two weeks of each other and the results are not usually immediate.
Chinese scientists have identified the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence of the disease, which is being tested globally, while the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is still being developed.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which can detect a disease or a previous history of disease) was under development, but not yet widely used.
Testing experience in China has shown that the accuracy of the test is only between 60 to 70 percent.
The US FDA approved a first-point-of-care test for use on 21 March 2020 at the end of the month.The test results published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University included the development of diagnostic strategies based on symptoms and risk factors for the diagnosis of disease (features and epidemiological risk).
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
These may occur as the disease progresses Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation.
Limited information is available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The key findings of autopsies include:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the lungs and pulmonary edema
Four types of acute viral pneumonia can be identified:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD has been implicated in the complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
to treat pneumonia: or systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining hygiene by using a hand sanitizer and avoiding touching the face, nose or mouth before washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose whenever coughing or sneezing and recommends reaching for a hand to cough or cough if you are not feeling well.
Hand washing after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of a face mask when in public, with one of the goals being to prevent infection, especially in symptomatic patients.Distance-keeping measures are aimed at reducing contact between infected individuals and large groups of people when schools and workplaces are closed, restricting movement and disrupting large gatherings.
The criteria are distance and include a 6 ft (1.8 m) drop.
There is no known cure for COVID-19.The most immediate time for a vaccine to be available is in 2021, when the strategy to combat COVID-19 is to try to slow the spread of the disease, known as "prevention".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or with their hands exposed to dirt, before eating and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
The WHO also recommends using sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.In areas where sanitizers are not available, WHO recommends two methods of use.
In this process, the antibiotic is made from alcohol (ethanol) or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not a "hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is prepared from a well (humectant.
People are treated with supportive care, which may include water, oxygen, and braces.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure but the benefits of this procedure are still being investigated.
Personal hygiene and health care and a nutritious diet are recommended to increase one's fertility.
Complementary treatment can help those with mild symptoms of the disease in the early stages.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the treatment of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have listed recommended practices from various organizations and put them on the free IBCC.
As of April 2020, no cure for COVID-19 has been found.
In treating symptoms, some experts recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen as the primary treatment.
Care must be taken to reduce the risk of infection, especially in hospitals where procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation are performed.
For healthcare professionals treating COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that the person be kept in an air-conditioned room (AIIR) in addition to using regular precautions, social contact precautions and air-conditioning precautions.The CDC also recommends the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during emergencies.
The following are recommended cosmetics: a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber band, a rubber, a band, a band, a band, a band, a band, a band, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an
N95 masks are recommended for industrial use but the FDA has authorized emergency use (EUA) masks.
They are designed to protect the person from airborne particles such as dust, but the limited protection against germs is not guaranteed by improper use.
If vaccines are not available, the CDC recommends that if there are no available vaccines, home-made vaccines can be used.
Most COVID-19 patients are not as sensitive to oxygenation but there are a limited number of people who need it.
The type of nasal protection required for people with COVID-19 respiratory resistance is primarily focused on people in hospitals, and there is some evidence that nasal cannula high flow or bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
It is not known whether any of these have the same benefits for patients with severe disease.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation if available because it reduces particle costs compared to high flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds for patients in proportion to their population, which limits the ability of hospitals to treat patients in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak and the need for beds.
A study in China found that 5% were hospitalized for multiple sclerosis, 2.3% needed a ventilator and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 patients in hospitals are admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more difficult as the prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with COVID-19 and respiration is becoming more difficult.
Ventilators that can handle high PEEP and respiration are needed to provide adequate oxygen while also reducing the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older audio equipment.
A clinical trial began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently being tested.
Remdesivir seems to be the hope.
While the development of new drugs may be delayed until 2021, other experimental drugs have already been approved for use in other diseases and are currently in advanced stages of clinical trials.
Antiviral medication may be tested on people with severe illnesses.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in clinical trials to determine the safety of convalescent plasma.The FDA has granted temporary approval for convalescent plasma as a temporary treatment in life-threatening situations.
Before the diagnosis, it would be necessary to determine whether the drug is safe and to determine whether it is effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile phone app to help track the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their names and ID number.
The app can detect 'close encounters' using tracking information, thus helping to prevent the risk of infection.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
In the event of a potential outbreak, the app not only recommends quarantine, but also informs local health authorities.Big data analytics on mobile data, eye tracking technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track cases and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
This was done to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with the infected.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared location data with the government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, which conducts research and prevention of infection.
Russia has developed a technology to blind those who are fleeing quarantine.
Italian Health Minister Giulio Gallera said he was told by cell phones that "40 percent of the population is still outdoors".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon on a weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Similarly, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called on the world to develop a variety of measures to combat the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel self-loathing about quarantine, restricted travel, medical issues, or fears of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The increasing isolation, loneliness, isolation, stress and economic isolation are all factors that are affecting the mental and physical well-being of people".
The disease may be mild and have few or no symptoms, as is the case with other common cold.
The symptoms of mild illness usually resolve in about two weeks, while those of severe illness may take between three and six weeks to resolve.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of COVID-19 from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but information on COVID-19 in this regard is not yet available.In humans, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and lead to pneumonia.
For those most affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
The most common COVID-19 infections include sepsis, abnormal clotting, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Hypertension, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, was observed in 6% of patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19, while kidney failure was observed in 4% of patients in the same group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes, transaminases.
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days with 10 days spent in hospital beds.
However, patients in intensive care units (ICU) had a seven-day delay between hospital stay and death.
In the early patient studies, the incidence of symptomatic and fatal outcomes ranged from 14 days to between 6 and 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for men.
Histopathological examinations of the dead samples indicate the presence of diffuse alveolar damage and cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported to the National Health Commission of China, cardiac arrest was found to have increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to a report from the United States on Wednesday, 89% of those admitted to hospital had other medical conditions.Local healthcare and economic conditions can also increase the number of deaths.
Estimates of the death toll vary because of regional differences, but also because of natural disasters.
Underestimating the number of healthy people can lead to a higher death rate.
Rather, because the deaths are those of recent illnesses, it may mean that the death toll is underestimated.
Smokers had an estimated 1.4 percent greater risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times greater risk of requiring emergency medical treatment or death compared to nonsmokers.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a decrease in liver capacity of between 20% and 30% in some patients who recovered from the disease and pulmonary scans showed that they were damaged.
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether any other disease was present in patients who had recovered from the disease.
The symptoms are apparent, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but patients who recovered from COVID-19 were later tested positive for coronavirus.
The patients are thought to have a new disease rather than a recurrence of the disease.
The virus is thought to be a natural and animal-derived spillover infection.
The exact source is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the disease was concentrated on mass movement.
A study of 41 early confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, showed that the first symptoms appeared on 1 December 2019.
Official records from WHO indicate that the first symptoms appeared on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These rates vary from one region to another and are based on the number of tests, quality of care, available treatments, time since the onset of the disease and other social factors such as age, which affects the overall health status.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the test and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 confirmed in the test without testing for SARS-CoV-2.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality and morbidity rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the patient mortality rate (CFR), the percentage of those who die from a disease, the infection rate (IFR), the number of cases (tested and retested) and the number of deaths from a disease.
These statistics are not clockwise and follow a group of people from the onset of the disease to the end of their lives (rescue or death).
Of course, not all patients have immune systems, but having an immune system can give us information about the number of people who are infected.
In Italy, where the outbreak was most severe, the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during the Carnival festival, where it affected young people, fewer people died and not everyone who died from COVID-19 was identified as a fatality.
Also, German hospitals are not overloaded with patients.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent of the population has an immune system, as seen in blood donors.
69 (0.004%) people have been confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The incidence of burns and the death rate vary between men and women.
The greatest mortality rate is among men, according to studies in China and Italy.
The greatest risk among men is in those in their 50s, and the average age of men and women is 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may play a role.
The difference in consumption-based mortality, women smoking less and men having lower rates of various diseases such as epilepsy at shorter ages than women may have contributed to the higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of cases were male and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the US government was not tracking gender data in COVID-19 cases.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most healthcare workers are mostly indigenous, women, which means they are more likely to be infected.
WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the time of first detection: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to any specific place (e.g. China), species or group of people, as recommended by international guidelines to avoid bias.The virus that causes COVID-19 is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in their public communication.
Both, viral diseases are often referred to as "coronavirus".
When the virus and disease first emerged in Wuhan, China, they were known as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease following 2015 guidelines to restrict the use of containment facilities.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to limited manufacturing capacity, some manufacturers produce medical devices such as nasal swabs and parts of respirators.
In one case, when a hospital in Italy needed a ventilator for a ventilator, a local factory devised and produced 100 of the required valves in one night.
Following the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information about the origin, extent, prevention and treatment of the disease and other information about the disease began to circulate on the Internet in a matter of minutes.
It seems that humans can transmit the disease to animals.
Researchers have failed to find any evidence of the bacteria reproducing in pigs, rats, and chickens.
There is no known cure or vaccine for this disease.
Global research on COVID-19 vaccines is being conducted by various government agencies, research organizations, and cholera researchers.
On Wednesday, WHO launched a "RESERVATION in Trials" process to evaluate the current vaccine to determine the most effective.
There is no vaccine but various agencies are working to find one that will help.
Preliminary studies of SARS-CoV are used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three types of vaccines being studied.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine that will eliminate the virus.
Using such a virus, not a matter of live or dead, aims to create an active immune system to new infections including COVID-19.
Another is subunit vaccines, which aim to produce a vaccine that causes the immune system to respond to the virus when it attacks the body.
For SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on an S-spike protein that helps the virus bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third type is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for developing vaccines).
Vaccines tested from these systems will require testing to ensure safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial began with four volunteer trials in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.The enhancement of the immune system has been criticized as a potential challenge to the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is confusing.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 clinical trials underway.
Seven trials were conducted on drugs already approved to treat malaria, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases are the main focus of Chinese research, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir across several countries due to be reported in late April.
A major clinical trial to develop a potential COVID-19 vaccine was conducted in April 2020.Many existing antibiotics are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there was unconfirmed information that remdesivir, a drug, would be therapeutic.
There was a significant drop in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are currently underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, used to treat malaria, was tested in China in February 2020, with some preliminary results.
Rather, there is a call for a review by various experts of the research.
Health authorities in Korea and China support the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking a daily dose of one gram, they warn that overdosing is dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency directive approving the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on medical advice for treating COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition is followed by the Chinese edition and adds interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for the treatment of COVID-19.
Recent findings suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was supported for further biomedical research after weakness in the initiation of SARS-CoV-2.The findings suggest that initial spike protein priming of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for the initiation of SARS-CoV-2 by binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have several weaknesses that have prevented clinicians from approving the use of these drugs without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its efficacy is unknown for COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a serious health hazard when COVID-19 is severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.Toclizumab has been placed on the Chinese National Health Commission's recommended list for treatment after a limited number of studies.
It is in phase 2 of a nationwide clinical trial in Italy after showing symptoms in a small population.
It is now combined with a serum ferritin blood test to detect cytokine storms, and is intended to inhibit such reactions, which are thought to be lethal in some patients.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on previous research to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another agent, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no conclusive evidence that tocilizumab treats and cures CRS.
Replacement of immunity cells from surgically treated patients with COVID-19 and their combination with a serum from a COVID-19 patient is considered a pre-exposure prophylaxis.
This method was tested on SARS but the results were not conclusive.
Antibiotic resistance is a therapeutic approach using a specific antibiotic to fight SARS-CoV-2.
Alternative mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Alternative therapies for silent antibodies, for example, the use of monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Convalescent serum, which is made from blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies to the virus, can be added to enhance the drug's efficacy.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of similar symptoms
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital in Wuhan, later contracted COVID-19 and died shortly after the virus was first reported.
