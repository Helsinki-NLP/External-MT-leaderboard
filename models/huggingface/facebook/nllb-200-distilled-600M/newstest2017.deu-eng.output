28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local mall's stairwell.
The victim's brother said he couldn't imagine anyone trying to hurt him, "Finally he got back on track".
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him very much", the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went up for him".
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend", Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook us something, to prepare our dinner", said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam the stream.
"In all that went wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shone bright every day", he said.
Anyone with information on the case is invited to call the SFPD reference number 415-575-4444.
I get stuck in drawers all the time.
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
That's what the Hollywood star made clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or getting labeled by outside labels that have little to do with me and reality".
"I myself have no desire to be perfect and successful".
"Honestly, I'm a little bit of a snitch on these things".
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The magazine says that the actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV, with loose-fitting, Mexican food.
"We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect", says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is No Child's Game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The movie will be on the air from August 25.
Golfers are getting the pyramid of sports
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of a change with a beach trip.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden pyramid of sport" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday night, chasing home in a quick galop to the feeder tracks.
A mile at this speed, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience", says Langer.
And that ended his riding career again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.
He let his family take him over the ALRV plant, he didn't even get on a horse for photography.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and so was the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports service presented the golden sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen during a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete is not short of awards.
Cross of Merit, Silver Bear, Champions Tour player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prizewinner, Hans Günter Winkler, on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me", says Langer, "because it is not only given for sporting achievements but also for social commitment".
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he gave away the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was inducted into the German Sports Hall of Fame on Saturday.
The awarded athletes include Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Shockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company moved into the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was held.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade deal - that's what Clinton and Trump both want.
The two US presidential candidates, however, have a disagreement on tax and energy policy and on a question of principle.
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the doubt low and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate the economy to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, Trump claims.
It will push back regulations massively and it will advocate for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to do, that it has opportunities to open up to disadvantaged people, and that it needs money to do so.
That's why taxes for the rich would be raised, she says.
Interestingly, they're both very close on the infrastructure issue.
It needs to be invested in, Trump and Clinton say almost equally.
The Democratic candidate is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State infrastructure investment programs are classic democratic policies and are strongly rejected by the Republican Tea Party wing, which is critical of the state.
So Trump could still be in the middle of a party discussion.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal plants and boost coal mining in the United States.
The Commission has also proposed that oil be extracted in protected areas, and it wants to cancel the Paris agreement on climate change.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program and says, "A country will become the clean energy superpower and create millions of jobs".
"It's either China or Germany or America, I want us to be".
But not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both are not willing to sign.
At the same time, however, both are not trying to isolate the United States from international trade - they are simply trying to better protect American jobs.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do about this is not quite clear: once he says the minimum wage must go up, then he says it cannot be changed.
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policies of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to unburden the economy and the citizens to stimulate growth.
His critics think that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton wants to at least demand that the rich pay more taxes, and her critics say more taxes are not the solution.
Flight: "Every woman who fled has experienced sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who run away alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house is a refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby who's at most one year old.
One of them put her little boy in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother is staring at the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a Bavarian social assistance provider, and is involved in the field of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized shelters for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid Foundation.
It was officially opened recently.
There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not an exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence while on the run", says Bahr.
"Men flee wars, political persecution, the threat of torture or death, or their families sending them to Europe as bearers of hope", she says.
Among women, other reasons for fleeing are more prevalent: "Many sneak away because they see no other way out".
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, forced prostitution, honor killings, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what drives her.
It's still going on on the run.
"Shoplifting for a bottle of water, for example, is not uncommon", says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they're not protected by their families.
Whoever thinks that the end will come when they arrive in Germany is wrong, Bahr says.
Here too, single women in refugee camps were often viewed as inferior and at worst abused.
This results in about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in northern Munich being traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children were probably not born voluntarily".
A lot of women are so used to not saying anything.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about their experiences because the shame is too great".
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, more accommodation is needed for them alone, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich within their sphere of competence, some responded with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and the Upper Franks, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
In Swabia, too, women who fled alone are not kept apart, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a government spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franks, some communal housing have floors or private houses for single women and their children only.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the committee says: "It is very important that men and women are kept apart".
"If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are kept together, there can be - continuous - violence against women".
The study says that the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women.
The need for protection for women is evident in the pressure on the Munich house.
"Since we've been rumored to be around, we've had a long waiting list", says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Strike of assistants: calls for new measures to combat work
The representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The British Medical Association's Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its entire Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistants and medical students voted against a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "conspicuously calm" about problems, leading to the treaty being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to call for official renegotiations to your full attention".
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour struggles, which will begin in early September.
The dispute led to six strikes by nurses this year, the first total shutdown in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA's medical assistant, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the sessions, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be made mandatory for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an "alignment of foreigners"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to lay hands and officially announce an end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot help but feel that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow and he barely radiated heat, even for his restraining behavior.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken repeatedly of his "beloved friend" Putin - according to one report - five times.
I couldn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I thought his enthusiasm was more like the opposite.
But a radiant, sustainable cooling from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin divided and accused Ankara of turning his back on Russia.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unfettered attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to record a sort of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire are clear to Ankara.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They're counting on a late-season storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti stated: "Tourists there, tomatoes here".
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it regards its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
In addition, there is continued resentment over the slow pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to profit from the cold and reduce Turkey's relations with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine, as one analyst once described me, an "alignment of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and ill-treated by the West and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they hadn't even covered the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator for Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this time, trademark strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other end-user financial brands.
She has supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she's decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised head office and the listing will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private-customer brands that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit to clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand our employees will be employed under as we become more of a bank of brands".
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we're not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we have asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think we're going to see a lot of change.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori splashes champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him a 3,000th profit.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a new milestone on Predilection, coached by John Gosden, at his local track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner, Dettori, who had won Ghayyar earlier, said, "It's something special".
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori is taking the cheer as he wins on Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jockey's of our time, and it's no surprise that he's reached this milestone that few before him have.
He's got style and strength, but it's his tactical intelligence that sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthralling fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he'd have already made 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding in Britain for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount.
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A number of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month lockdown, but he showed an impressive strength of character to challenge his doubters and return to his best form.
And it's not over yet -- Dettori said earlier that he wants to continue competing until he's at least 50.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's tightest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a Kremlin statement, Putin said that without giving any reason, "he ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration".
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin's website says (in Russian) that he was later chief of protocol and chief of staff of the government staff.
He said to Putin about his appointment, "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state on drafting laws and checks to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince you?
This move has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once hailed as a potential president wanted to lead Russia's environmental policy at once - was met with great skepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in an interview in early 2012 to entrust me with these very complicated - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I've been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken over by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement its cancellation.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly Thursday before announcing his resignation.
There were artistic differences and differences of opinion on the set.
I regret the incident", he said in a statement.
Details of how the character Gibsons is written out from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have been putting all my heart's blood into it for the past 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that's not gonna be possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and most of all the best fans you can ever want for a series.
The scheduled broadcast of the twelfth season is set for September 28.
Mystery of the Fish that Landed in the Garden at Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandals spat out of a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 feet from the sea, posted a video of the show on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The Fife section of the bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rope.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnessing an engineering feat of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the total deck is in place and the final section of the deck is now being given concrete cover for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents a future-proof high and low building.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the gap on the north or the mainland side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.
Massive, the viaduct being 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.
The tolerance the team was working on was tiny, only a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded an alarm at 1:20 P.M. on Friday after a crew watched the incident in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on its own.
"We saw the boat spin around near them and imagined the worst", said Vince Jones, head of the Moelfre rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds had already weighed the boat out of reach until we were able to water it", he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a boat without a life jacket.
They all got on board the coastal lifeboat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and unharmed.
The boat engine had an emergency stop, but it was released when the boat was turned off by the person who was controlling the boat.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Seriously Wounded - Man Takes on Ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to his apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the drunken perpetrator cut off his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was wounded in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old was destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her life partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
On the street, they ran into the man's ex-partner.
When the two women reentered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who's building cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made more responsible in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 affordable homes in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a 'residential action plan' for the next Council meeting.
But fighting is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the cheapest housing?
There is no rule yet.
The SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We are in agreement with the Greens: those who want to build on urban land must in future identify 20 percent of all housing as social housing".
However, the affordable housing can also be created in stock.
The main point of contention in the House, however, is, as Bratmann says, "how to deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent of the housing stock on such land, but as much as 20 percent of the housing stock as social housing".
A new urban housing assistance programme, which will cost millions and still needs funding, is to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann says, is that "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment".
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The left wants tougher conditions for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann said, the housing market was on the verge of worsening.
The implementation of the action plan will provide for additional tasks in construction management.
We need more staff.
It's unclear if we'll get the specialists.
The programme is not yet complete, however, because the 1260 new homes are to be built anyway.
But how do we compensate for the loss of another 1,300 affordable homes that will be sold out in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent this, according to policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, the city should now purchase outgoing bonds.
In addition, it would be necessary to consider bringing housing back into the price range.
It's possible in the West Town.
The problem could be solved in one stroke.
Because in the West City, deadlines run out at the end of the year.
Around 1,800 apartments could be bought back in the price range for affordable housing.
It's just that the owners, the housing companies, don't want it.
The number of social housing units in the western city is again dramatically increasing, and this is a step away from the objective of the so-called mixing.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
The Greens expect there to be more movement in the debate.
The party's chairman Holger Herlitschke said: "For a broad majority, the CDU must join us".
It has focused on more single-family housing.
But that doesn't mean that a compromise can't be reached.
Pokémon Go, a worthwhile quest for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play but prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
Time spent on the screen was limited to the TV, then to video games, and finally to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm referring to the Pokémon Go delusion, of course, an app based on the characters that were originally created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest dropped slightly before the game's release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overwhelmed the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (by a screenshot on their phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when they were younger joined the madness and jumped off the couch to find it.
In the United States, gambling led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked who train for 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go - it's just looking at the raw data to improve performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want people to "take 30 minutes to get off the couch", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have been deafening because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Regular exercise reduces the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that's too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air, sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also the murky game-wreckers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run into a door.
What's the matter?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to exercise like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decline over time.
But because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles is making gold in the Damenters
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Easy on the bar.
It's stunning on the floor.
Brilliant in the end.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American athlete climbed to the multi-sport title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
Their total score of 62,198 clearly exceeded that of silver medalist and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles, American, is competing in the women's singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win a multiple-fight title and fifth overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended in that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best athlete I've ever seen".
She was waiting for a final test in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's singles final in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while serving as a wake-up call at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey to the top, that's not really true.
Part of their floor exercises - which include their typical tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin American music that would fit in at home on the street outside Rio's Olympia Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a baby by her grandparents and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force to be reckoned with.
She hasn't lost a multi-fight competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wants.
Mustafina was carrying the picture even though she was lightly leading through two turns.
The world championship was held in the vicinity of the towers.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the swing bar and put another one on it with 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her final outcome - a mere formality - and tears streamed down on Biles's bright red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her book of collections became a reality.
Raismans' performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who the Americans call "Grandma", had a lead.
After her floor exercise, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old tweet that was spreading rapidly earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in a car while listening to music
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first mass murder case while talking in their car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while parked in an driveway, authorities said.
The shooter fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the side of the passenger car and then fled with another vehicle, the report said.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in four months in predominantly Hispanic residential areas.
"It's happening in a residential neighborhood outside a house", Howard told KHPO, a CBS subsidiary, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were still on the scene.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge cases and secured a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But like the few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't let that happen.
Which is not true at all -- of course, you've been allowed to do that", she said.
Your husband Vincent and you have been informed that Edmund may never recognize you and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first response to that was 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with a pedestrian.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress.
He can walk and ride a bike with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing me a song".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not typical sign language, she says.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, and infections with viruses like measles or Zika virus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's going to be better.
You know it's gonna get better for you.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding, rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and massive flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout the Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened large-scale flooding following heavy rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance to affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone had requested 10,000 sandbags.
A flood warning system will be in place for much of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday while rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger as it will only flow slowly through the dried-up rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest point on record at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still picking up people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said he was warned by another stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was flowing and flowing in", said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high rise of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and that he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as heavy rainfall continued and that authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily dried up by the rainfall since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rainfall and flooding caused rescuing residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school outages in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a prisoner in Tangipahoa reported 200 homes flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
City manager Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed away by the flood.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"Once the water starts to return, they will be able to return to their homes", he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flooding and sandbags were provided for residents hoping to keep the water from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March", said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was continuing to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but no reports have been made so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", said Townson, "and it's still coming".
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pierced by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time a 6-year-old has been shot this week.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in the thigh, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets", his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started his first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot, two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, the other two victims are stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old man, who is in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are now investigating whether the perpetrator could be among the wounded men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
The cartridge cases for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles overlooked the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the aisle, were holes.
So it seems there were several armed fighters who were very active here", police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests have been made and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine about the women's Olympic team in gymnastics, and for more than one reason.
First, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three female athletes, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been an inspiration to many young girls of other skin colours.
The structure of this team, the roundup of Aly Raisman, who's Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who's Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally reflecting the United States.
It has cemented the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female athlete has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That's a sign of strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievements of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in an individual women's multi-sport event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're at the top of this sport, but that's not what gyms look like all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They're the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four female athletes in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that running is an expensive sport and that turning is primarily in private clubs run by parents who pay for training, accommodation, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel costs (for the coaches and their turner and their families).
Most of these clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
These clubs provide all the training for the athletes, and this is a costly and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both been coaching their athletes since they started to run.
We must make it possible for the countless communities of young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to get more affordable and more accessible training.
I started my 20 year old gym foundation.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tours in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to offer high-quality sports to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Tournament develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as academic and professional success.
It's the inspiration for this team that's gotten thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics, and that's great.
It's so important to be involved in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and thank you, get so many young girls from all backgrounds motivated to begin their journey to become healthy, strong, and successful young women.
Doctors want to organize more strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 physician assistants who voted in an election rejected it.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract into effect, saying that the NHS was in a "no man's land" and that any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first assistants are to be awarded a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at off-peak hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Committee on Physicians' Assistance, said in a statement last night: "Physicians continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current labour crisis and will fail to treat all doctors fairly".
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors is signed up, progress must be made and time runs out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through talks have met with reluctance and sometimes deafening silence from the government.
This happened to a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the strain and address the concerns of the physician assistants".
If he fails to do so, the assistant physicians have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and doctors were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain.
The Ministers had hoped to settle the dispute over the amendments by accepting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 physicians who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, called on the medical assistants to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work-fighting measures do not reach anything that only burdens overworked teams and service providers and only bring anxiety, distress and disruption to patients, nurses and their families".
Over the past two months, we've spoken to the physician assistant committee and responded positively to concerns about the care and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from work, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about complying with the agreements with the BMA in November and February.
The £2 a day medication that can lower the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 a day medication after the authorities recommended that more people be given it for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS's NICE regulator recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS's NICE regulator recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, about 140,000 people have a heart attack, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty materials in the arterial walls that form the lining.
If the lining breaks down, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had a heart attack before are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely to cause blood clots.
The draft NICE guidance published today recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg of ticagrelor followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have had another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences".
Fear of a heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience has shown that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By making a preliminary recommendation for Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend the treatment options available to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of political correctness is making voter fraud flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the grounds of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud being ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet Member Sir Eric Pickles verbally accuses police, election observers and councilors of ignoring evidence of electoral misuse due to "hypersensitivities to ethnicity and religion".
The former minister for integration and local government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidating voters on religious grounds would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up barricades outside polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry a card to prove their identity in elections.
At present, all a voter has to do is state his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when they vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for greater access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups for the press.
"This is not only to combat electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him".
Up to 300 votes were either questionable or the result of a simulation in which one person votes over another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarmed by the fraudulent letter-polling - where older members of the Muslim community had been pressuring people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including keeping IDs to prove identity
The report states: "It has been shown as evidence that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote at the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... government institutions knowingly ignored such behavior due to 'politically correct' over-sensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists editing ballot papers to stop "electors".
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for stricter registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once they have cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure that he or she is eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic letter selection.
Prohibit political activists from editing full ballots and envelopes of ballots.
Give the police the authority to put up a blockade around polling stations.
An amendment to the law facilitating the prosecution of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
No photography in polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for corrupt and illegal practices due to a litany", he said.
He was found guilty of sufficient - in accordance with the high standards of criminal procedure - for a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the ineffective "dependence controls" of the electoral registration departments of the council chambers.
Sir Eric said: "The Tower Hamlets court ruling last year was a warning sign.
Our country, the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Mad about Kates cyclist and other famous Olympic double-medalers in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have been shocked this week by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven herself to be an impressive double for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-winning athlete to have her own famous doubles - at least not if you believe social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are now flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Aside from Kate's double-walker on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed to what a certain archer the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio might be like.
U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a stir on Twitter after images showed him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he's been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much similarity myself, except for the facial hair", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment".
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come to the fore this year: the striking similarity between British sprinter Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian competitor Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to pass as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-brown skin and blond hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been certified by fans to be an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too.
The theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's similarity
One Twitter user expressed satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are pretty much the same".
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal winner in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of fourth place 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the 4x200m freestyle relay angered viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympics on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "walked off like a mule" and died during the race like "a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he finished his 4x200-meter freestyle swimming relay to give his own opinions.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add more color, could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost her connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like a bee, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the swimming team 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air".
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the women's 4 x 200m freestyle final as saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost her connection, baby".
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many talking about him
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterward, CBC moderator Scott Russell apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment being broadcast on a swimming performance".
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry it happened".
CBC eventually apologized over 90 times to the people who responded to the comment via Twitter
The commentator, Scott Russell, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air last night and to our social media followers.
To make it clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not her as a person.
Yet they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of language.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remarks by stating that it was not his intention that they be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming event on CBC's Olympic broadcast", he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not to her as a person".
Of course, there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry".
Purchaser in Primark is angry at woman trying on underwear in the middle of the store shamelessly
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primary store to try on underwear.
To make matters worse, she sampled what she looked like, took it off, and put it back on the shelf.
She kept on sneaking around and tried on four pairs of underwear at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The primary store at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her underwear before putting it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on her underwear, "she got dressed again and left without buying anything".
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw".
Standing in the middle of the sale area, she took a pair of underwear from the display, took off her own panties and pants, and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a somewhat more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freaked out like Oscar".
"Everyone stared as she put on her underwear again, which she obviously didn't like when she put it back on the shelf".
She repeated the same thing with three more panties before finally deciding she didn't like it, dressing up again and going out.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried".
Mrs Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that was worn by another person and not washed".
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added: "As far as I know, the staff tried to pull the clothes from the sale after they left - which is just as good".
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman was wearing them and taking them off again and they weren't washed".
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone".
All products in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Armed Attacks With Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga League in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the tip for your robber.
If approached from behind, turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "get out of line", says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the line and twist as the assailant crouches in pain, taking the gun out of his hands, and hit him in the face with the run and move backward as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and strike the attacker's chest, then twist the weapon from its grip before they move backwards and aim the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, it's the safest way to hand over your money in a robbery is if you're not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright squeezes his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler had his immune system and choking reflex tested seriously - by devouring some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk travel writer and presenter Ian Wright, 51, built his train on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet toilet button and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before he bleached any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to be exposed to.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of unplugging a toilet button that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, a kitchen sink contains more bad bacteria.
On his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he swallowed left him but a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public landing at railway stations to toilet washing machines, the task definitely put his immune system to the test.
In the film, he said, "Even as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, dirt, worms and mud water".
He certainly did his reputation in the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to count after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one in less than 60.
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "That's close to the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet".
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna attract anything here because it's disgusting in here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company is equipping Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the development of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior President of Valios Venice for Snacks, Juices and New Categories, says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We did some crazy brainstorming, and we ended up saying, "Let's call Ian".
They say that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context -- the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I told him to leak, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film".
Of course, there were things that were easier to get Ian to attract her and others that were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've got some of these dirty treats on film".
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid added.
Social family destroyed before delogation social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asymmetrical family left their social housing after a £50,000 loss for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their Saltash, Cornwall, property after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing co-operative employees found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls were filled with holes, pieces of wood were torn apart, garbage was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was applied to the walls.
The family was relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private residence
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned the apartment was no longer repairable.
She said, "It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered a less beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who were living in the apartment at the time, and police said the terror that had inflicted on the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was ordered to behave antisocially in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
The wood parts were torn up in the property where drugs were traded in the past.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly by the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly removed her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The delogation was applauded by relieved neighbors who said their lives were being made a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone".
We lived next door to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here is incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning".
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said it was unfair to the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the older side of the community house, trash and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to take any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour, as a disengagement is always the last step in the Cornwall housing scheme.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be seen horribly by their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community have done to come to us and have the information delivered.
I hope this development will bring comfort to some of our neighbors and send the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation
House management workers will now have to clear the garbage that surrounds the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to distribute.
She claimed the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private home in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they'll delude tenants who don't follow house rules
Angela Crow, of the Devon and Cornwall Police, said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who are not following the house rules.
"This is for those who think they can behave without self-blame and for those who have been harmed by such behavior", she said.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low-flying military jet overflows beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft made an incredible downing flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a jet jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost tangibly over the sun-worshippers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the exhaust engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew really deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me".
Tourists at Aveiro Beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so deep that it was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet was flying slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby landslides, but the air force insisted that security was not compromised at any time.
This summer, landslides have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - that he could not see.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting for the first leg of the new football season.
The Catalans will play out against Sevilla in a Spanish Super Cup match, with the replay set to take place three days later at Camp Nou.
The double-winner must, as far as possible, with the underdog Cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion, among others, forgo Neymar, who is competing in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
The Commission has also proposed a new directive on the protection of the environment.
The German suffered a knee injury during training, which has at least for now cleared the question of entry for Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for the number one position for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far waived a clear decision on this and has left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen has been the lead in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated 0:4 in a test match against Liverpool on Saturday.
Even in the 3:2 test match against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. weren't really convinced yet.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has to beat Real Madrid in the European Super Cup after a 2-3 loss and is aiming for a second win in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic champion in table tennis.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "defensive player" Zhang Jike 4-0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world-ranked first-place player won the "Golden Grand Slam" with victories at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and the Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final as expected and won the title.
It was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would win the individual title in the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese to climb the top of the Olympic ladder was former SVS NW Legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sentences and time-outs, they didn't have any coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protectors go in a fair competition alone.
"I've played for my country all the way up here".
"I'm playing for myself in the final", Zhang had said consistently.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang with only 13 points.
Ma's superiority did not produce the exciting match that was expected.
Nevertheless, there were enough spectacular changes.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4-1.
The White Russian had suffered a rib injury in his quarterfinal against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then undergoing medical treatment, had to "finally" settle for bleach.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had, by the way, become Olympic fourth in similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits to "huge problems" in the election campaign
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive concerns about losing its majority, even in traditionally conservative states.
President-elect Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his campaign in the Republican-controlled Utah stronghold.
A rare moment when the usually arrogant and self-confident multimillionaire expressed a sort of concern, as reported by correspondents.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts are growing about his success in the fight for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah", Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Because of the false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media coverage.
Republican high-rises are shaking
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutions may see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that Republican candidates in the state have.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he would stop Clinton's march: "Just like I have done so far".
And then he said, "Either this is going to be successful, or I'm going to take a very, very nice, long vacation".
He does nothing but "tell the truth".
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump continued.
Then I'll return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party has threatened to withdraw funds to support his campaign if he cannot present better polling results.
Instead, they want to take the Republican congressional candidates under their wing.
Olympic: Trick and Treat at a doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's athletics team is facing a serious blow after the second doping scandal at the Rio Olympics.
After a fraudulent attempt at a doping checkpoint in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee has immediately called for the establishment of a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that former sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village in the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to investigate its own affairs, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment", it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, passed the test and signed", Kenya's chief of mission, Stephan Arap Soi, said.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's training checklist.
Ferguson Rotich was the fourth-place finisher in the 800 meters at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests against payment.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has long been under special monitoring by the IOC for its numerous doping offences.
The announcement of the more than 2000 doping target checks imposed by the IOC prior to the Rio Games unusually highlighted the targeting of athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics started.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping practices comply with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
A series of ARD television reports have repeatedly alleged that doping is readily available in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was demonstrated that the sport was widely and systematically doped.
Russia's sports were subsequently excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, masterpiece by Leonard Bernstein.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classics and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra's grave, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, led by Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, exclaims: "This music is full of rhythm".
We always say it's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an elderly Mary.
She remembers her love affair with Tony with awe, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, she's musicalally exceptional!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course she's naive, and she's very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman", Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist".
It's such an honor to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
He needs to direct.
You can see it in every move, in every look, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip W. M. McKinley, "West Side Story" is highly relevant: "This play is about prejudice and bigotry".
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as relevant today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London school girl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is to keep people from ever making this decision - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone", Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from east London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultan's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a Supreme Court nominee in the event of a Garland victory.
Harry Reid, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he hadn't talked to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he's speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't cause any trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, were lackeys and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants a nude calendar for "Women and Men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous nude people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muse calendar for 2017.
Treats editor Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from old-school playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does.
"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the release of the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Those who don't adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases", says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near-foundation Dialogue and World.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", says Ali Toprak, the association's president.
Because of the harsh treatment of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey to Germany as the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition", Ali Toprak, the association's president, told the World on Friday.
Because the government has already overrun Kurdish strongholds with penal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds are in Turkey on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country", said Toprak.
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and Alevi cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years", said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "positions itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" is taking place against Erdogan's critics.
For the first time in the last few months, I don't feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition figures.
The brand of a Gulen follower destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who don't adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, and the Kemalists and secularists are too", said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the World.
According to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were already the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany recognized for political persecution before the coup.
As of 30 June, this number was 11,386 people, accounting for almost 29% of all asylum seekers (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or hopelessness.
Asylum seekers are subject to individual political persecution, i.e. by the state.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Going where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the parliamentary elections will not be held again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not stupid like it used to be: summer holidays, heat and parliamentary elections - that bites.
The locals who are to be convinced by the campaigners are on holiday.
The majority of the holidaymakers who are in the country, whether they are travelling to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not local people, so they cannot vote for the parliament.
There are practical problems: During the holidays, it is difficult to get help by hanging up the posters, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers and counting votes.
By September 4, 2016, the election day and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the election campaign pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say so at all, has just begun.
And there's also something about it: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of the SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It's exciting how hard the newly formed AfD is cutting and what's left of the coalition in the end.
Sellering, 66, who has been prime minister since 2008, is running a nearly unnoticed campaign, as seen on his big posters.
He travels the country, distributes roses and chatts a little with people, just like his legendary word-carrying predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's flourishing.
Their refugee policies, their "we can do this" policies have accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU and its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, have already experienced what it's like to campaign in the wrong place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large sittings; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is in the north-east.
But the target group disagreed, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Pre-Pommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states", complained Vincent Kokert, CDU secretary general in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is also a pity that nobody from other parts of Germany ever listens to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely forgoes the usual campaign campaigns in marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert says, is only a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that you are breaking ground in the countryside, that it must work very hard to find a way to reach people.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the vast majority of the country.
However, the advice given by the CDU candidate Kokert to his supporters is also self-evident: "You have to go where it hurts, where people are: village parties, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used".
With so much at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to campaign particularly hard.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were 22 per cent behind their partner CDU (25) and just short of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 elections, the SPD had still clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a minor party with seven percent of the vote, are likely to make the leap to parliament.
They're making the holiday need a modern virtue and putting their campaign online for the most part.
"Online election campaign", says the state president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners are going to search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just sailing home in a houseboat through the lakes of Mecklenburg and still enjoys it.
Their impression: "Voting in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 Sanitation: Restaurants are under lockdown
The speed at which B27 is being repaired is nothing to be gauged.
The people responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5:30 a.m. and ends at about 8 p.m., are everywhere praised.
"They made everything pretty messy", says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tank.
This is a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved south at the beginning of the week to the halfway point as planned, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
The reception of those responsible for the construction works, such as those for the establishment of conveyance services, is also commended.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the Aspergstraße blockade in Ofterdingen was lifted, and the connection to Rottenburg was restored, traffic conditions within the town have relaxed.
Citizens can now drive from frequent B27 routes on both sides.
The traffic around the place seems to be declining.
"There were some serious complaints", says Florian King, deputy chief of staff responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise because many people were looking for slip roads and trusted their navi rather than the signage.
Which led to some trucks getting stuck in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not respected, the municipality increased its demand for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant breaches", says King, who once informed himself about the situation on the ground.
There's been two or three blasts a minute.
The fastest was at 77 km/h in the 30 speed zone.
But since the construction site moved on, it's been calmer.
For the businessmen on B27, it's a little consolation that the road is now open again for Rottenburg customers.
Business people don't like to look at the maps.
But the fact that the B27 cleanup has led to a sales breakdown on them makes anyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to adopt a new approach to the internal market.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "very slight decline" at the Maier car dealership, but admits that "the running time is lacking".
The most crowded are the streetside.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.
That's already a threat to our existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants were "hard hit".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
He estimates the sales losses to be "well over 50 percent".
The road cleanup has been "throwing its operations back two years".
He had to fire half his staff.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them had been laid off, the politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt, on a question from Mr Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, replied that the hotel would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on B 27.
Göhner knows of other counties where such a thing has been handled more generously.
Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to operate.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, and it's a long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less likely to pass by because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular client will return after the renovation work is completed.
Despite the crises of BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B27 construction on his customers to be the largest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
The Commission is constantly pushing for legislation in the name of counterterrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now putting forward a massive security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière is the reconciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the interior minister said at the launch of his new security package.
You're not overwhelming anyone.
Other further points would be discussed first within the parties.
I'm also involved.
As interior minister, however, he was concerned about results and a "consequential consensus" within the coalition.
Mr De Maizière has given some time to present his conclusions on security in the Republic after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
But they are now even more extensive.
There's something that's been announced, announced, and pointed out: that a new security agency is supposed to be responsible for breaking encrypted communications is not new.
Nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU provisions on passenger data and gun laws.
The call for more video surveillance and security personnel is not surprising either.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second round of proposals that the SPD has not been able to make: he wants to punish the promotion of sympathy for terrorist groups and to strip German citizens of their passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD", admits the CDU man.
He believes that this is reasonable and does not demand anything from the coalition partner that he has no chance of doing.
I think that the Commission is going to be able to take a decision on this.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the following:
Refugees who are being brought into the country on purpose should have their smartphones checked and social media accounts exposed for security checks.
He wants to make some of the sanctions for rejected asylum seekers worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to hide their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things seem to be still unfinished and leave questions open.
And on some points, like the treatment of patients, the question is, what does this have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the subject of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be ruled out that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about safety given the high refugee numbers.
And things that people were deeply engaged in were not being left out even during election campaigns.
Internal security is a huge focus.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections coming up.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking positions on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have been on the rise.
First a fierce dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a collection of security policy ideas by some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of the Resorts also demand a ban on burkas and a withdrawal from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also struggling to find conciliatory tones.
He doesn't like a double-pass deviation.
We have settled the discussion in Germany.
It doesn't make sense to reopen them.
And with a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all respects and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner remains to be seen.
There's a lot of stuff in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also trying to make a name for itself in the field of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first cautiously signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still going strong.
Despite the diesel scandal, worldwide deliveries are on the rise.
But not all markets are running round.
There's a concept to the recall.
Volkswagen will start deliveries of vehicles in the second half of the year.
The biggest carmaker in Europe has continued to show a positive trend in the past year, despite the diesel business, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July the core brand of VW weakened, particularly in Western Europe, again affecting overall sales, as reported by the company listed in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July, 1.8 percent fewer than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second-largest market after China, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the German domestic market, deliveries were cut by almost a sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July to two days less sales in Europe.
In addition, there has been a buyback in some core markets due to 'changing economic framework conditions'.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU was also a burden, a spokeswoman explained.
In the United States, where the emissions first escalated, there is also a downside.
The Chinese market is a major supporter of VW.
Overall, the mainly affected Dutch brand is still shining through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a 0.9 percent drop in deliveries to 3.37 million vehicles is recorded.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to show sales growth from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during that time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated the gas test with software.
In Germany alone, VW is bringing about 2.5 million cars to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars had no negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The manufacturer shall issue a certificate of 'guarantee equivalent' to the customer after the conversion, but not of 'guarantee' as was said in business circles on Friday.
It's because of legal tricks.
The Focus had reported that Volkswagen is now offering a guarantee to its German customers for re-equipped diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting took place.
'VW must fully comply with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA.'
'A derogation from this will not be accepted,' said Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has undertaken to ensure that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all relevant vehicle values for type approval remain unchanged.
However, Volkswagen itself does not use the term 'guarantee' as it was called in corporate circles.
The broad term 'guarantee' enables Volkswagen to see the possibility that customers, for example, could come to a workshop six months after the conversion with, say, an engine failure - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also in the interest of the customer to avoid any uncertainty as to the possible guarantee arrangements in relation to any other damage which is not related to the exhaust gas scandal, as stated.
That is why VW does not use the term 'guarantee'.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is the second institution in Germany to charge fine interest on wealthy savers in the future.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on their checking or checking accounts".
The German Banking Association (BDF) speaks of an individual case and sees no sign of this: ordinary savers "should not be afraid to pay penalty interest on their savings".
Banks that store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB) must pay a fine of 0.4%.
The fee is to be recovered from private and corporate customers from September onwards for deposits exceeding EUR 100,000 in circulation or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free".
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year", Paul said.
He has been keeping 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he cannot use.
"They are on my central bank account and they cost 0.4 percent", the bank manager said.
"I can't put up for every million, 4,000 euros".
He is now passing on the costs according to the principle of causation.
"I've seen four robberies, I don't want another one", said the bank's board.
Most clients would have understood and switched to other forms of investment.
Few went to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association stated: 'The ECB's extreme monetary policy course is causing significant costs for all banks.'
The Commission has not yet decided whether to adopt a new directive.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the calculation of the aid.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay overhead deposits, as competition in Germany between banks and savings banks is far too strong".
One banker said that there was "a client at Tegernsee with a somewhat more luxurious estate".
"That can be a problem for a small bank if it keeps free money".
The Gmund cooperative bank, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association "is currently unaware of any other banks charging a disbursement fee for deposits by private customers", said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had stated at the end of June: "The threshold for going negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce and investors are threatened with leaving the competition.
The customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in general.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to smear him with harsh insults under the pseudonym Not All AloneMiddle Ages, this statement is based on current data.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials wanting to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely buyer.
It's also not a hobbyist's horde - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56 percent vs. 53 percent) and enjoy spending time alone (69 percent vs. 66 percent).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news story on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and sneezing wildly before I stand up, hold my hands and say something definite like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it".
So let's take a look at this.
Even as Sohos's heart slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants, and offices now fill the buildings once occupied by independent vendors - there are still a handful of fantastic dishes.
I'd probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I'm standing in close proximity to different men in these shops trying to assess their age and mood by observing.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray to Reckless Records, is one day in London for a meeting and going through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snapshot, I didn't follow him home), are wearing off the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they came out and to buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably a little too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and enjoy spending time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets are on the YouGov profile.
But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I've had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again", he says.
That would explain the boom in fans of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.
Some fans of records feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that will evoke happy youthful memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort", says Wez.
That's how I am as a collector, and I think that's how a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to get engaged mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" a coworker whispers from a record stand.
An ICM poll in April revealed that nearly 50 percent of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't own a record player.
At this point in the news, I'd probably look very worried while I scroll through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Somebody just came in here and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-oriented, less music-oriented.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
They're younger people, not older people, who are just slow to come in.
Fopp, who's dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I'm going in.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop sounds from the speakers instead of experimental jazz - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but burning psychological trauma is hard to detect when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records for sale.
She's more of a window slit than a big shopping.
She doesn't earn much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It's expensive.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is"... she sighs with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm making the look of jeans, I'm watching a group of teenage girls group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them -- maybe because they're purely decorative, some so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's just "recording art".
But given that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the deep sea for more, there's nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
Even though my research has shown that YouGov's findings are correct, they ignore, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
You certainly won't spend your Thursday morning strolling through record shops on Berwick Street and flipping through records, while avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake moderator who is putting nothing on the shoulders of middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate animal - Video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was set by a female who is thought to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters tall.
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should have the power to demolish 72 temporary shops where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which poses a fire and sanitary risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the Court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also noted that the temporary shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions".
He said the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demise was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, a nonprofit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and counseling on asylum issues for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old".
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest figure to date - following a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.
Despite the disappointment at the Olympics, Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, cycling pro Tony Martin is not willing to let himself be undermined.
"I keep my eye on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting", the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place in the sugar hat.
"I find it hard to comment on yesterday's time travel", Martin said.
He must calmly analyze the reasons for the debacle.
At the World Time Trial Championships in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look closely at everything we've changed lately".
"My position is also included", wrote the three-time world time trial champion, who on Wednesday lost more than three minutes on the 54.5 km to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympic: Tennis pro Siegemund misses the semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's victory campaign ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: the world rankings 32nd from Metzingen were lost by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
The Olympic tennis tournament semifinal was marked.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass her blow once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the medal hopeful Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to make the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German professional tennis player, Tommy Haas won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of the Summer Games had last played in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group increases in live video game broadcasting start-ups
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend -- and Microsoft wants to take advantage of it.
The tech company is buying the startup Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not disclose how much money is going into the acquisition on Thursday.
Beam launched its offering in January and has already reached over 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene.
For example, they can give players missions and confront enemies and provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of esports.
Facebook is supposed to help us on the way to the global media event.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the startup, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi has announced.
The acquisition is therefore not intended to change anything for the customers.
Beam is being integrated into the video game division surrounding the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's mother alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement trailer.
Germany's razors must adapt to the next generation of speed meters: in various German states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested to transmit timers particularly effectively.
For example, the futuristic-looking enforcement trailers from Vitronic in Wiesbaden can be used at crash sites where it would be too dangerous for a mobile police measurement.
For example, on highway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained with a stationary flash.
But a sustainable mobile construction can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement trailer is self-contained: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, and the case data is encrypted via a modem.
In addition, laser measurement technology can be used to record all vehicles simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits and traffic restrictions by time, lane and vehicle class may also be monitored.
In high-speed mode, the trailer can be moved with any trailer-coupled car, according to the manufacturer.
To prevent it from being stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and, by the way, also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is to protect the flash from vandalism.
The trailer has been tested in various German states since 2015 and is now also used, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also thrilled with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 last year.
Britain takes silver in Rugby 7 after Fiji wins Masterclass gold
Britain's impressive performance in the 7th Rugby World Cup came to a sudden halt in the final on Thursday evening at the final hurdle in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-to-back, line running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The boxers' clear defeat, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could come back to them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form in that format.
It might be a comfort to Great Britain - but it probably won't be - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
The UK had a difficult road ahead of it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This bitch is gonna hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started off beautifully and had the British attack off for fun.
It felt like you were running around in buses, and the World Series winners went up 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau tied up the corner.
With four minutes left to play, Jerry Tuwai added another right-handed hit, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's remarkable tackle stopped Man Leone Nakarawa's mountain from scoring a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the refit and there was still over a minute of play time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou rushed through further weak tackling of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the seven while Britain is still learning.
It's the same.
GB made fundamental changes to the half and closed the Fijian gap for four minutes, which was good for the first half, until Joshua Tuisova made it through after a brilliant mid-final from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a test for Great Britain, scored a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went a long way in favor of the South Sea Islander, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the grandstand.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame continued the i-tail with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and GB kicked the grass in a devastating way.
Earlier that day Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final and Britain had pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown led the boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal below the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15th Aside team, secured the win and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the coach's battle with cancer to win the rowing
There's no more emotional gold than these games, and that means something.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard-hitting hives that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was just the two of them who were on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams, who was present when they were rowing for their second consecutive Olympic gold without a steering woman, the first women in the history of British sports to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th unsuccessful effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant female athletes sliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph they have achieved.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of volunteers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he's a risky guy.
I had bladder cancer, which is surgical, and they did.
If you don't, it'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the look a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to start their treatment early in 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that's the right term under these circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, running around the station -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week.
It just repeats how much it means to me, how much Helen and I and Robin have worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so a huge thank you goes to him.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much trapped at the moment.
Helen called out, "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to be dragged along.
We got off to a good start and at the same time, we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want to fire a fireworks display today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which is what we did.
The couple will take a year off before making any decisions about their future.
Glover's scheduled to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better", she said.
For 31 years, he has been an example of clarity
The director of the water association Veitensteingruppe, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary in Bavaria".
A small Frankincense drinking water association as a model for the big water producers.
This is what the original version of a Bavarian radio article said.
Shortly afterwards the Water Forum of the government of Unterfranken recognized the association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used to finance the implementation of the common agricultural policy.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Veitensteingruppe drinking water association, based in Kottendorf, in the municipality of Breitbrunn, extracts approximately 150000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 towns and villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member communities are the communes of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities, water supply contracts are in place.
The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed water warden in 1985 and was appointed as the managing director of the association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse, ranging from water and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends", the Chairman said.
The most notable events were the commissioning and opening of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high-altitude reservoirs (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There was no pause and innovation was constantly being introduced because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has been very committed to his water association and he has lived the water association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was given the opportunity to present the Veitensteingruppe's successful concept of nitrate reduction to the water forum in the district of Unterfranken.
He has received much recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised the water warden Alfonso Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best bodyguard in the world, and he was a loyal man.
We were an unbeatable team together.
He described the well-building and the restructuring of the purpose-built association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the pipe breaking at the top of the church on January 3.
This will have to be worked all night at minus 17 degrees to provide water to the villages.
The supply of new sources was also maintained once only because the high tank was filled with hoses from Pettstadt.
The management of the drinking water association was transferred to Daniel Stürmer of Lauter, who succeeded Rupert Göller.
Sopranos Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism and says to other parents: "You have to have the courage to talk about it".
"Medicine has made great strides", said the 44-year-old to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she thought she had to die.
Tiago, now eight, had made good progress and is now studying privately in New York City, where the best therapists are available.
"To give an example: when I ask him something that happened two years ago when I was singing at the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything", said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago is from Netrebko's connection to bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship in bargain - Man shoots his wife
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at around 10:45 a.m. on Friday at a multi-family home in Bargteheide, Stormarn County, and killed her.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his life partner", said a police spokeswoman.
The perpetrator is on the run, and he's being publicly identified.
Now it's all over the country, because Sven S. could be driving around.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, brown-burned, and bald.
Meanwhile, the police have released a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
The man is now bald.
I don't want to be directly addressed to the man.
He can still carry the gun, the police said.
If anyone sees Sven S, call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state".
The victim was 1988 and the perpetrator was 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially refused to give any information about the murder or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"This is a murder".
"We are not saying anything more at the moment", said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
- A clearer picture for the German steel industry
The crisis-controlled and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of additional costs.
The financial burden that the industry faced from the support of the green electricity sector is off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy for the so-called own power generation plants in the German steel industry remains, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ, Freitaga).
"I'm really happy that after two years of hard negotiations we've finally reached this".
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers to cash out the gas from the blast furnace for their own consumption.
The steel industry was threatened with additional costs of EUR 120 million to EUR 240 million per year, according to the German Industry Association.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission following discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced will an EEG voltage fall by 20 percent.
But even in the steel industry, this is not taken up.
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the EU Commission on the generation of electricity.
This largely sets the status quo of the previous system.
Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"This is the first step in our 'Steel is the future' campaign".
"More must follow".
"Climate and employment objectives must also be weighed in the reform of emissions trading", explained IG Metall Head Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation further worsened as the world's largest producer, China, launched a massive global steel market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers are accusing Chinese steel companies of dumping.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties on imported steel are showing an effect, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has been bleak.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industrial leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last time, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp also wanted to avoid closing individual plants.
At the end of 2015, about 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced 3.4 million tonnes of steel, a good six percent less than in the previous month, the Economic Steel Association said on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the quantity produced declined for the second consecutive month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two percent below the previous year.
The Association expects to increase emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, spirit, health: singing makes seniors good
Ursel Kipp has been singing her whole life: as a young girl, she was in the school choir, studied music at the seminary, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically", she describes.
After a test, she says, she feels more balanced, cheerful, and overall more alive.
By the way, she's doing her health and mind a good thing.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from many perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Regular association enables older ones to make and maintain social contacts.
Because often, social and family structures dissolve with age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience was also made by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To speak and organize, to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association".
In a positive sense, singing can be exhausting, says Hackler.
Because in this way, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
People who regularly use their lungs don't get out of breath as quickly as they do in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Senior Workers.
In the older generations, singing together was a much higher priority, she explains, and was part of everyday life, both at school and in her spare time.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often coupled with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia remind themselves of long-standing events.
In addition, a special skill is required of the head when singing, explains Lenz.
To focus on your own voice and a certain rhythm at the same time and adapt to the other singers is a big cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that comes from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Singing in the choir also increases self-esteem.
To show myself: When I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - that experience is strengthened.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, do not hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, advises Lenz.
You can't sing alone - 50 people singing, who can hear a sound?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer an overview of the local choirs.
If you wish to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church clergy directly.
Many older choirs are also available on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with your Internet search.
If you want to sing, join a choir, says Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.
Cats are more sensitive to the cries of young animals than caterpillars
Biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of cats' cries on adult animals.
To their surprise, the males were not cold because of the miaue, but they always behaved the same as the females.
Female cats can detect the excitement of kitten babies by the mias of the young.
They respond 10 percent faster to the sounds of kittens in distress, as scientists at the Veterinary College and the Medical College of Hannover (MHH) have found.
Cats respond to kittens' calls, but they always do.
"The acoustic differences between the miue of less and highly aroused young animals are apparently either not noticeable or not relevant to the males", said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the team had already found that the length and pitch of the kittens' cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult kittens and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
They were played on one of the screams of little ones who were taken out of the box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
Second, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were raised up in addition.
The researchers consider their findings meaningful despite the small sample size.
"All females, even those who had no offspring yet, responded to the screams differently", Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call played out to the much more excited kittens.
This ability may be innate or develops with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males did not respond at all", said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the human response to baby sounds in women and men.
Some studies have also shown that women respond more sensibly to infants, whether they are already mothers or not, according to biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski is going to the Super Cup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued for the arrest of former football star Hakan Sükür.
He's accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football match is being held in Turkey.
Before the duel between the rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is in fashion.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the July coup attempt, the government insisted that the daily life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
They don't stop before football.
The prosecutor's office issued a warrant for his arrest against former starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to the report, Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
The first 90 days of the state of emergency, which will last until October, will have almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy vigil" in public places across the country was declared over by Erdogan on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas workers' club are traditionally not friends of the president.
But what unites most Turks in the face of dramatic experience in history is their strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree on that - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
If the Gala wins the Cup, it will be up to Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne international proved his sporting worth last season: with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best on the square".
He finished the season with a great finish and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to Poldi, the disappointing season for the record-holder ended in a conciliatory way.
After the preliminary round of the Champions League, the Lions will also be eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it was only sixth.
The season wasn't good.
The Cup was the only way to win anything.
"We have done this and that is the most important thing", said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the year was better.
Most of all, thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 seasonal goals as the Super League's top scorer, laid the foundation for the 14th title.
That's also why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to proceed with the implementation of the measures.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it", club manager Fikret Orman quoted the magazine "Kicker" as saying.
But if the attacker is willing to forgo about a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary in Florence".
Despite doping, these athletes still have a medal chance at the Rio Olympics.
Justin Gatlin, 34, has been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other overweight athletes can only laugh at this - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to dominate the headlines of the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who had sued for her right to start shortly before the Games after a doping ban, was mercilessly flogged and beaten during her 100 meter breast start.
A curious scenario occurred: with a smile on her face, she was still proud of the hall and had provoked her performance.
When it became clear that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke into a jubilant storm.
But there are many other athletes who are competing in the Rio Olympics despite their doping history.
Here 's a little overview .
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-meter relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was jailed twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his banishment, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, being the world's number one in over 100m in 9.80 seconds and considered Usain Bolt's greatest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion was banned for six months in 2010 after testing positive for the pain medication Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discussion/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 World Champion and 2010-2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking the drug and was jailed for six months.
The four biggest draws this year go to the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400m relay/USA): Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400m, tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt claimed.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 meters is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammer thrower, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been stripped of so many medals since.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after testing positive for testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 World Championship for testosterone abuse.
He also won the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics, which he also claimed, after a ruling by the International Court of Sports (CAS).
With 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold-favorite was tested positive in May, but still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found to be taking a banned dietary supplement, and the World Anti-Doping Agency's ban was lifted on July 13.
Bomb attack in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and was treated in hospital, but was able to leave.
She planned her trip home for early September.
It is not clear whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens.
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities on this matter, Schnöll said.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital, Bangkok, two bombs were first detonated in a slum on Thursday evening.
Police said a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosions went off, killing another person, authorities said.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket early this morning.
Police said a taxi driver was injured in the explosion near Patong beach, a popular holiday destination.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
The authorities say the explosive device was detonated in a flower bed outside the coast police station.
Finally, several injured were claimed in the explosion at Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and at Chumphon on the southeast coast.
It was said that the explosion was connected to the Hua Hin.
"The bombings are in the same handwriting", Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters early Friday.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack".
It is too early to say what motives might be involved - but it is likely to be the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, however, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces", said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Authorities have received intelligence reports in recent days of upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed of the exact time and location.
It's not clear which group is behind the attacks.
Police have instructed their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are not usually directed at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bombings, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be strictly followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
After clashes between security forces and Muslims, unnecessary travel to these provinces is advised.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will continue to have a major influence on the military in the years ahead.
Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, economic improvement and tourism.
The military junta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, claims to have restored the kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to contain the years-long insurgency of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
In Bangkok, just over a year ago, a bombing of a popular Hindu shrine killed 20 people, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identity Movement" has become the target of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
Several state agencies have also put the group under surveillance by the federal constitutional authorities.
"We see signs of the 'identity movement' as an attempt to break free democratic principles", said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the German press agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants from the Islamic faith or the Middle East are slandered in extremist ways.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The 'Identitarian Movement' is a grouping of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is against "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of one's identity through overstrengthening".
Constitutional defenders in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitaries".
Maassen said his authority had been in close coordination with the state authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to get their target group back where they are", the head of the constitutional protection said.
Generally, extremists try to reach them in a youthful language, often with pop music.
Islamists would do it, as would right-wing extremists.
This is not a publicity stunt for your own good.
The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous.
Recently, there were reports from several federal states of contacts between the "identifiers" and AfD politicians.
Maßen said he had no knowledge of this.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the drafting of the draft law.
It is up to the party - in this case the AfD - to change its direction and become extremist by certain people who are extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not obvious.
In view of the significant increase in law-based crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we've found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the Old School Society or the Freethinkers.
It is quite possible that further right-wing terrorist groups or small groups may be forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee shelters or other right-wing extremist motives.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
The previous groups were either at regional level or on social networks.
Maassen expressed concern that many attacks were being carried out on the accounts of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's what's worrying.
Many of the suspects of attacks on asylum shelters were previously not known to be criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wingers.
"So many people have committed crimes that were not related to far-right extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or left, but then radicalized by a far-right attitude".
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros's Hafte becomes an internet hit
The Olympics or world records don't always make the headlines at the Olympics.
This is demonstrated by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Hava at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Games.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was sometimes no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared, no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, the habbat became a viral internet phenomenon.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished 48 seconds behind and placed 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was his not-so-sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still competing in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special starting right by the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else.
All we have to do is prepare for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made their way around.
Some media called him "the whale's tail".
Based on a "wealthy stomach", the English tabloid The Sun made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, which was only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons to "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
The equatorial-guinea swimmer's unforgettable performance was when he had to compete alone in a 100-meter freestyle event.
He was frantically fired at Moussambani.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial air in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We're celebrating the 90th anniversary of the L.A. Central Library with, what else?
Geretsried - The owner of a store in the New Square has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old lifeguard left her shop around 5:30 p.m. on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8:15 a.m., she found that about 250 euros had been lost.
No trace of the perpetrator was found.
There is no video surveillance.
Trump doesn 't see the impending election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is speaking at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the presidency of the United States does not go well, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the November US presidential election, he wouldn't care: "Finally, it's either going to work, or I'm having a very, very nice, long vacation", the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with US television station CNBC.
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
He called U.S. President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founders of the Islamic State terrorist group.
Within his party, more and more resistance has been forming lately.
Postal trade in electric transporters is increasing
An electric delivery vehicle from the German Post in action.
Other companies seem to be very interested in the companion.
The Post is planning to sell its electric street scooter, too.
The company will soon be trading the transporter.
The Post Office intends to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into third party sales", a Postal spokesman said Friday.
The company has been considering selling its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other companies for months.
Postmaster General Jürgen Gerdes had said there were constant requests, such as from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine Der Spiegel, the Bonn Group is planning to enter mass production of the vehicles soon.
In its post-production plant, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group would significantly increase its fleet of electric vehicles and aim to make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020", he had said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're rearranging the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been operating on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the longer the successes he promised remained uncertain, the more uncertain the chair of Matthias Hartmann's CEO would become.
Turbulence at the helm of Nuremberg-based market research firm GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of management, the global number five in the industry faces a new start in personnel.
GfK's CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the GFC, Arno Mahlert, will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The company said that the management board was already being led by former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September.
He's supposed to officially assume the role of "leading spokesman" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
The company cited 'different views' on the long-term business policy as the reason for the resignations.
A company spokesman declined to give details on Friday.
The future of the market research company is still unclear.
Investor circles said on Friday that shareholders had recently been disappointed by the remaining successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The results of the restructuring are not yet visible after five years", it said.
In view of the recent bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will be restless at some point.
"If BMW were like this, the Cants would be like this", it said.
The company failed to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 after falling in the prequarter.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 per cent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.
Compared with the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4%.
The profit in the second quarter was mainly affected by the decline in the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The EUR 139 million corporate write-downs required in the Consumer Experience business unit resulted in a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had also made a group profit of 19,7 million.
Accidents - Bus slides in crevices in trenches: eight injured
In the event of an accident involving 43 elderly passengers, eight people were injured in Krummhörn on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old bus driver of a tour operator from Eisenach said she had to avoid a truck that was partly on the opposite track.
The bus came right off the road and slipped into a ditch, police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own", she said.
The fire department released the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on State Road 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back by a bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
They should be waiting for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators urged the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater shall be EUR 3,36 (up to EUR 2,26) and EUR 3,64 (up to EUR 2,18) for the area of the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant from 1 October 2016 instead of EUR 2,10 for the previous year.
The wastewater charge will be increased again at the Azendorf plant at the latest when appropriate improvements are necessary.
The price of wastewater in Azendorf will then be EUR 4.37 per cubic meter, according to an exaggerated calculation.
As reported by Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU), the approval of the budget by the Kulmbach Land Council Office found that these wastewater facilities are under-covered.
The Kasendorf market is legally obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.
From 1 October 2016, citizens and businesses from Welsh Kaal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into their wallets.
The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.
As the managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a new calculation of the charges for the market town's wastewater treatment plants was necessary.
The Commission also concluded that the amount of the aid granted to the Union industry was not sufficient to cover the costs of the restructuring.
The Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy operator that would be able to provide the services of the Union.
For example, the low distribution basis would have a serious impact on costs of repairs of several thousand euros.
In addition, the wastewater supply in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
In addition, the cost of renovation and repair of all three installations was significantly reduced over the previous calculation period, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welsh Kahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system at the Azendorf wastewater plant had to be replaced due to damage.
The almost 20-year-old storage facilities at the Welschenkahl pump plant had to be completely upgraded and the Lopp pond cleaning plant had to dig up the first sewage pond after almost 20 years of operation, dispose of sewage sludge and install an additional ventilation facility to comply with the water requirements in the future.
Schmidt: 'These extraordinary expenses were the continuing maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period.'
The same applies to electricity costs which were still well below current levels in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that the small amount of wastewater in the three plants would "fully cover" the costs of operation and maintenance.
In addition, Schmidt added that the market community has been spared large maintenance costs for wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the installations mentioned will continue to be precarious in the long term, as the Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be extended to these installations because they are in deficit.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest level (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2% was recorded.
The average annual inflation rate for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0,8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0,2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0,2%.
In July 2016, prices of the following groups of consumer goods increased compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained the same as last month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to race.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that is already bordering on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blurred, proprietary tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All errors are made public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past for promoting blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed a filter this week to some users that gave them slick eyes, false teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow faces".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely circulated, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and, to put it mildly, unpleasant".
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-faced was pulled to the detracting extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's crossing this cultural loophole.
American culture seems to be embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people -- who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts -- might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder to keep things like that from being noticed than it was before", said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and media engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Media and a phone interview, she said that she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have diverse representation of people of different skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions", said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people of different skin colours working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it".
Others share their views, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees on Thursday, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said she's closing her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that's not OK".
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, Congress committee finds
Military members of the United States Central Command altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, compiled by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and the Armed Services Budget Committee, reports major discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how their superiors changed their assessment of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically stolen by senior Centcom commanders regularly showed a more positive picture of American counterterrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than analysis by other intelligence services", the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders", said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The mistakes of the Centcom leadership extend to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of US efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While it provides no direct evidence that Obama administration leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have been exposed to pressure from their bosses to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements made to Congress were significantly more positive than they were", the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official publicly announced that a military retake of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, that's all that's clear", said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's top officials changed intelligence reports to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations into Centcom's reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are underway.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the Republican Task Force's findings.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for producing intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services", said senior Democratic member of the committee, House Speaker Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports", damaged the morale of analysts, and "provided excessively little room for divergent opinions".
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding "a particular political opinion".
The preliminary findings of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon's inspector general, which were taken after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on any congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But he also said that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on how to interpret complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense".
The investigation has implications beyond the question of a successful US-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of Defence Ministry personnel).
Last year's allegations raised the question of how much President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the classified information about the Islamic State recalls conflicts more than a decade ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then George W. Bush administration, contrary to many analysts' recommendations, provided only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the aftermath of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr Hooker reported from government agencies that, contrary to government statements, airstrikes on the Islamic State-held refineries had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries were set up to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation during a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is coming up
One day after she scored three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the US women's field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I have no idea", she said.
I'm not one of those people who keeps their gates in memory.
But she knows this: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympics and are equally in first place in their group with the British, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory over Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, and the match will decide which of the two teams in their group of six teams will take first and second place respectively.
The first-place finisher will take a little longer to get out of the way of the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday, the American women have had a surprising turnaround through their success story, four years after finishing last of 12 at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had her first hockey bat in her hands at age three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at age 16 became a U.S. national player, the youngest in team history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn't qualify for the squad.
Then came 2012, the year that everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the national team coach, and things started to turn for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change", Bam said.
We didn't have the workforce in London we have now.
We were able to pull the rudder completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the tower in the first half with a backhand from the nearby area.
India had entered the tournament without a win, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the lead 1-0 until the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.
She sprinted the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle, and ran the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shut-out was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position", said Parnham, "but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday".
In the midst of the Olympic rage, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever the time, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a racing race between competition and aspiration.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, handed down from the shooter to the swimmer to the athlete to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a female squad with pimples, could have been among these famous names that are broadcast on Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV ads, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, Calif., is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event in the same way.
Further down the centre, in some shadows, are the less well-known sports: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have the breastfeeding and may it last a long time.
But if I am to make a humble argument for my particular favorite, let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampolining has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparse over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed didn't know it was an Olympic sport at all.
It could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampolining and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians share the prices for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampolining has a certain charm on the outside, partly because it sounds more appropriate to the uncluttered ear for a clown school than it does for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has a sense of humor -- the cartoonish shaking of its never-ending impact -- but also the grace of spinning and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "jumpboard".
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air, and must make a series of falling movements (spins, straps, and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are rated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty and flight time.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopers must go on their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playing field.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but in the television broadcast they are also pursuing another outrageous goal: the world or the Olympic record.
Purposeful striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a viewer to tears.
But it's also what I find a little tiring myself watching these games.
The trampoline provides a breathing pause.
The trampoline sprinter vector is up.
A move forward is not the goal.
He or she crashes, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
There is also competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamlike, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's rounds on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
Amidst the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If the rise in awareness can only be achieved through the attack and objectification of male athletes - as the male US turners recently suggested in The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new, air-struggling fan base.
"A generation is protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed in clashes with police in a shootout.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police fired and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, probably from the end of this year or early this year, show security personnel beating young people with sticks as they were forced to raise their hands against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Commission is now demanding a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future", said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model of democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the government's repression - opposition in the country has been curtailed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were exiled or imprisoned, killed, or driven into the vastness of the wilderness.
But that could change.
"When you oppress people and they have no choice but to protest, it breaks out", said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation of protesters.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to strangulation regarding the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea, a battle over this loose, controversial line that claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less subdued in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of quaking beneath the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they had gathered in protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amhara are not natural enemies.
For centuries, the Amhara people, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have flourished in politics and business, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella", said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromo.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharians and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill", said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to take the position of Mr Meles for relatively obscure reasons.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested elections that analysts said were apparently rigged by the government and then stolen.
During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, although fewer than in recent months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal dislike of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Tigray-run businesses in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred of Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a strange position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced it had closed down that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it doesn't want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This", said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin line migration".
Donald Trump declares his claim that Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.
It also puts his fellow combatants, who try to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of having to make statements he could not have meant.
After making the hint at a campaign rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rudled back on the Thursday claim and insisted in interviews that he really didn't mean to imply that President and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early tweet on Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation quite seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism is pouring down on Mr. Trump as he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling survey numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were giving speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to get back to that.
He tweeted that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already used sarcasm in his defense.
In late July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack into Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course I meant sarcastically".
This method allows Mr. Trump to push the language boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, 'clarifying' depending on how the reaction looks", said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more offensive tone as his polling numbers continue to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he has been increasingly the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in an uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is legitimate, political comments", Mr. Giuliani said, so when asked about the veracity of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State, he said:
It's true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was a little little organization that was almost unknown, he called it the backstage, it was completely wrong and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the polls in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of repeating every word he said and being biased against him.
He taunted the "poor, miserable" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once the price is pushed off the market, the cafe in Greenpoint comes back.
Verb Cafe was a shitty, cash-only cafe in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were driving him out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Local people mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, except for the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is change, then it's also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who owns and manages the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to provide funds for a new outlet, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, has been keeping a lot of things going.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same old verb lamps.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu has sandwiches with bacon and cheese and garnishes like capers and sausage onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, it's got fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg", he said.
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her own path.
After the verb was closed, she said, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that coffee and culture were the verb that I liked", she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the verb began in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same.
"I came quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they were cooking my everything bag with butter", he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he swaps his Everything bag with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no regrets about the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we'll still take up their offer", Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it on display soon so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice store wants to bottle the cold brewed coffee and sell it.
There's a chance the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the place and ordering a new coffee felt like coming home.
"I had to smell that", he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a delicacy, President Roosevelt had a crush on refined Fifth Avenue delicacies like pate de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and a plum pudding as dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people", said Jane Brickman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Brickman's book, "97 Orchard", tells of life in a low-rise apartment building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", which will be published Tuesday in Harper's, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, cordless snack in the Flatiron District that's been in business since the stock market crash of 1929.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potatoes and vegetable blend.
When the reporter ordered a roasted ham, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about food during the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular", said Brickman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as your dinner.
Coe laughs.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead", he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" records the ways the country dealt with not being the country of the monkey.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for Americans", Coe began, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally tense: Mystery foods like bread and casseroles became staples, with casserole being "a wonderful way to recycle leftovers", noted Brickman, as chefs could hide unpleasant ingredients under a cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of American cuisine, became a rare luxury.
Strange blends were tried, since a high-calorie, nutritious meal was prioritized over taste or even healthy cooking.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the lunch hour", says Coe.
Brickman goes on to say, "It was surreal".
Peanut butter and baked onions don't match.
It was typical of many household recipes.
As never before or since, household managers - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have been driving the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic treats.
The reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me have cake" attitude, are particularly tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he ate like the millionaire man of the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce", Coe said.
He was eating in a nearly gilded dining room and wearing a tuxedo.
He was a wonderfully strange man.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't urged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book describes, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most uncomfortable to prepare".
Many of the ways of dealing with food from the Great Depression era were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our continued focus on calories and food, said Brickman, and how science has been applied to food.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they had a better understanding of Bickelman's mother-in-law's eating habits - such as not being able to throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food", Coe said.
"She actually made people sick", said Mr. Brickman.
That's where the windbag incident happened.
After clearing the plates at Eisenberg's, she and Coe produced a home-made dessert, the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip", said Brickman, adding that it was a common trick to miss a chic name for modest recipes.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each of them reluctantly dipped a spoon in the tough, brown glands.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a three-time hit.
Like a can-do budget guy, he told his wife, "A couple of hacked walnuts would help".
Killed in a bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save other people's lives.
Now the 30-year-old has himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to Bild, has saved nearly 60,000 lives so far.
2,900 volunteers risked their lives to evacuate people from bombed homes and provide first aid in war zones.
You are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil rights activist who rescued an infant from the rubble of a house for 11 hours went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
But he never saw himself as a hero, and according to the picture, he said, "For me, this is the real jihad".
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me".
Shortly before Omar himself was killed in an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it", the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old
It's a rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims through the North Atlantic at about a mile an hour - to this day.
Greenland sharks do not hatch until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims smoothly along the North Atlantic Ocean, reaching an average of just 1,200 feet [1,220 m] in an hour.
Only when it comes to that, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.5 miles per hour - and at that top speed is half as fast as a raccoon.
But this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a patent for old age.
At least, Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science that a Greenland shark could be 392 years old.
"Madness", comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, on this life span, which is a world record for vertebrates.
Although evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland sharks become rocky.
It's just that the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, especially in the icy seas off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and the Spitzberge.
Because they prefer water temperatures of about six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their time-range as they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of the peaks.
The prey of these sharks is still there: In the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of a raccoon, while another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling the bottom of the icy sea, searching for carcasses that are drifting down from higher water levels.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or the Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just over a foot [81 cm] long, while the largest shark was over a foot [502 cm].
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the shark's lens sinks.
This center of the lens is formed before the shark is born, and the proteins in it are not renewed afterwards.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkably high amount of carbon-14 in the lens sink.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests were hurling greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
The third smallest animal, at 220 centimetres (220 in), had a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons testing, so it may have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens sinks, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a Greenland shark measuring 493 centimeters showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter shark is estimated to be even 392 years old.
Greenland shark females were known to spawn when they were over four meters in length.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals, at 392 centimetres, was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and was determined to be 156 years old, Greenland sharks are likely to reproduce for at least a century and a half.
This is also a world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methusulms live primarily in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck around its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
The low temperatures often cause the organism of the animals living there to burn.
So they mature later and age more slowly.
In addition, to keep warm in cold water, the animals often grow particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than the surface through which the animal dissipates heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible", explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
The most recent meeting of the Municipal Council focused on construction issues.
The Board welcomed the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, plotting and development issues have been resolved and the applications for surveys submitted, the sale of land in the residential areas 'Straßlweg' and 'Schönau-West' (Binderstraße area - expansion section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The town council is convinced that the buildings in the rural and quiet residential area are equally attractive to young families and elderly people.
As mentioned, the building volunteers can report to the town hall immediately, and the municipal council is expected to consult on the land lease at its September meeting.
In order to meet the demands for the relocation of other commercial establishments, which are linked to job creation, the Municipal Council decided to amend the new land use plan in some areas, which was only drawn up in the spring of this year.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated will be extended by two plots towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main therefore has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote", says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's Competence Field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets.
Following the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses will be allowed to continue to operate financial business from London across the EU.
The EU passport is currently only valid in the UK.
Big US banks are using it right now.
Several banks have already announced job transfers.
The Frankfurt Main Finance lobby group expects 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years.
The IW is speaking for Frankfurt at the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
Although the OECD is headquartered in Paris, it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it allows them to communicate directly with supervisors", says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg has a large fund sector but is less successful in infrastructure than Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easy access to commercial real estate.
"It's not that easy to find high-quality office space in Paris", says Voigtländer.
The Seine also has a 50 percent higher rate of rents for first-class commercial properties than the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking by the business consultancy Mercer, the city is seventh, Luxembourg nineteenth, Dublin thirty-three and Paris thirty-seventh.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference, the IW concludes: "With its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors".
But despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, economists say.
The Commission also notes that the Commission's analysis of the current situation in the Bank of England and Ireland shows that the Commission's analysis of the current situation in the Bank of England and Ireland shows that the Commission's analysis of the current situation in the Bank of England and Wales shows that the Commission's analysis of the current situation in the Bank of England and Wales shows that the Commission's analysis of the current situation in the Bank of England and Wales is not in a good position to assess the impact of the current situation on the financial situation in the Member States.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of a $200 million damages for violating two of Merck's patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including perjury and other unethical actions.
U.S. Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said at the hearing Thursday that Gilead was entitled to a discharge of the costs incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work on which Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines, was based.
US-backed forces say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed forces have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently searching the city after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council, an ally of the DKS, told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently doing clean-up", he told Reuters.
Clintons make $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% of federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which gave the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband $10.75 million in income and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking engagements; the former Secretary of State reported a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton are releasing their tax returns for the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20,3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency", Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the IRS as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train", Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he wouldn't allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charities, his business practices and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the topic and posted a video online on Friday in which senior Republicans are calling on Trump to release his tax return.
She also spoke on the subject during a business talk in Michigan on Thursday.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to release his tax returns", she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business reporter quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisers on Friday as saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a hot topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is headquartered here, called on Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump was "scared" of voters and not tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has been issuing tax returns since 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40,5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax returns showed that they only received $100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which the Clintons taxed $109,000 in dividends and income.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox method to keep elephants from entering human-inhabited settlements - throwing condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea years ago, has intensified its support with the US Nature Conservancy by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent fourth-level method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities, with them being much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant", said Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "Chili Cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, the end of which is turned up to the ignition cord.
When it's lit, the condom explodes with a bang and sprays fine powdered chili powder into the air.
A breath is usually enough to drive the elephant away.
A final possibility is that a pitcher will shoot a gold-rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The Council unanimously decided that no kiosk building on the St. Goarer Rhine River should be allowed.
The St. Goarer region usually accepts investment projects from businessmen with a coat of arms - especially retail in the core city is considered to be highly expansionary.
The proposal to build a sales ski resort on the Rhine River near the Rhine Balkans, which is under construction, was now rejected by the City Council.
"We generally welcome new operators, but at this exposed location on the Rhine, this kiosk is not the place to be", explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director destroys Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-selection was removed at "Arab" request - RT News
A French director of Jewish roots sparked media outrage after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli priorities because Arab guests "requested", according to one employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be contacted directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
I'm not sure what Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an option to choose Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel manager said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-selection be deleted", Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has been added to the hotel chain in Germany is even more shameful.
It doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident sparked quite a response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some asserted that the Kempinski Hotel had "abandoned" the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"Shame on you", said another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürst dam, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order to exclude Israel from the shortlist", the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when police officers tried to tear the students apart, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposal of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against the interim president Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests came days after mass protesters took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 percent - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, with the lifting of sanctions, Moscow-Tehran trade grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have been increasingly interested in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking over existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran", Dzhagaryan said.
The Commission also noted that the volume of trade between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70,9% compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through the supply of machinery, agricultural vehicles and weapons", the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is predicting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Embassy in Foreign Affairs issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of tourist numbers in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken", he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he said.
Witness wanted: Forest beer market raided
A robbery was committed Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL liquor market on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Three people in dark clothes, disguised as gunmen, demanded cash from the liquor store's employees and then fled on foot, first and then, presumably, with a silver VW golf.
The police are not reporting the amount of money that was stolen.
The perpetrators are said to have been between six and seven feet tall, so they're relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run after the robbery towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking lot with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
If you have made observations related to the robbery at the time of the incident (about 7:45 p.m.), you should immediately report to the police.
Nagold: Play and have fun in summertime
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the Nagold Child Protection Association's social education day group/social group work with their carers in their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet, hard-waldle, the happy group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
One was boarding with the visit to the zoo.
The other was to Maulbronn, where a special children's guided tour took place in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and plan.
In culinary terms, children and caregivers were pampered with their own cooked meals such as the sour spatsle, the seebronner pannle, the Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and the Tübinger Bolognese.
Workshops were used to make jewelry, make beautiful jewelry out of pearls and stones, or make a Roman mill game out of wood.
Other highlights of the leisure period included fishing in a nearby pond, the evening at the fire, and the closing "Bunti Evening".
On the day of the trip, the sun laughed and the children and youth returned home satisfied.
Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna mental health unit were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were completed together.
In order to bridge the time until the next trip of all ministers to Rome, which is expected to take place in two years, the St. Anne round of prime ministers decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage of several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the decision was made to move to the bishopric of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage was made to the city of Münster, Freiburg, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms set out.
The night before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims to a small feast in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and bestowed the pilgrim blessings.
From Horb, the train was taken to the starting point of Villingen, where a Munster of Our Lady is also located.
Each day's tour was framed by a brief impulse each morning and evening, with various prayers, songs, and scriptures.
But even on the way, the minis would take a break at field crosses, chapels, or churches to sing a song of a specially composed pilgrim hymn.
The local parishes had parishes for each night.
At the staging points, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and invigorating dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, the journey continued via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stages to St. Peter were the most difficult, but in the heat of the day, they had to climb down to about 500 meters and then climb again.
The reward was a joint barbecue at the bathtub in the evening.
After the morning rush on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing St. Peter's Monastery, the final stage was taken to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at Freiburg's Münster later in the afternoon and entered the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, we thanked God here.
At the evening mass in Münster, the mines arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by the co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaum Metropolis.
In the afternoon, we took the train back to Horb.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Britain collects gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rose to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio when the British team defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the role of anchor that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken for himself. The young dog made the legend proud as he stormed home to claim a victory from his favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after finishing only a modest sixth at the London World Championships in March despite Hoys' retirement.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to bridge.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that had now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds New Zealand won in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold.
Hindes was almost back after his lap, but Kenny led the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change in strategy made up a big part of the transformation, where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they got on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison".
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After his 2012 triumph at Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell onto the track after a poor start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a great victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the British flags on the podium".
We've been coming together as a team for the last three months.
We've been so bad at so many world titles, it was incredible to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress over the last five months, that's five days of successful velodrome waiting for us.
With the Kenny's form, it's possible to repeat Hoye's three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
For Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a bounty of six gold medals and one silver medal would mean that he would be rewarded with a gold medal.
That's the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next in the sprint, which starts today and will run for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for the moment".
The team event is always the best.
You can win with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.
They reached the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record for winning gold in London 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the race, with Wiggins certainly in the spotlight.
He had been arguing with a commissioner before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13,260.
The British team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-Olympic period and to collect a host of medals.
After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been lowered.
There were dramas in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid accusations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of celebrities like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But if you look back on the first night of the Velodrome competition, it looks as if the legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment has reached its peak, could be repeated.
The future of Portland smelting is questionable due to the cancellation of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium smelter in Victoria - and hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and thus terminates all supply contracts, the energy company said.
This step followed the decision by the Victorian government earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
At least 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk if a closure occurs.
In addition, it could have domino effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Portland-based Alcoa smelting business is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it was expected that three more owners would terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
'AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that there will be further physical demand for electricity from the smelter,' the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called 'security transactions' which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period and will expire in 2017.
'Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in fiscal year 17,' the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual financial statements of $187 million in 'expectation of termination'.
Alcoa said that the decision to award contracts would not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or to provide electricity to the smelter.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that was supposed to go into effect in November of this year, even though it still owes an explanation as to why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions in the industry.
Referring to the statements made by analysts earlier this week, Chief Operations Officer Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us as electricity producers, that would be bad", he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian Jenner clan manager and mother Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and has been a fashion week runner in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?) scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the troubled Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the all-time favorite showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister's cover and ending with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This is the cliche action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest introduced the phrase, "Did You Think We'd Forgot You?", with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a morning radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to get her other girls to participate in that commercial somehow.
With the September issue of Vogue, a new era for the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have been the biggest hit on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league of its own.
The September issue is the best-selling issue of the year for Vogue.
With a volume that is more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of the magazine were advertisements).
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine have leaked even before its official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more "celebrity models" than "models who are famous" on the cover.
Oscar-winning Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even with the slight chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if it applies to Jenner).
You're really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat strained.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid were criticized as "the crap of the moment".
These feelings boiled up again when the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
But the resentment seems to be getting past the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising her foundation Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Community law centres dismiss 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most disadvantaged are rejected by municipal law centres each year, while the industry is preparing for the impact of further cutbacks on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust redundancies - are already rejected when they seek free legal advice and assistance.
The legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these law firms are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queesland Community Law Centres, said the latest National Association of Community Law Centres survey showed that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from the important services you need", he said.
People who are leaving violent relationships, people with insurmountable and overwhelming debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unjustly laid off -- all these people have legal issues and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of more disadvantaged people in Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Attorney General and the Senator for Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in legal matters.
Last year, the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their client communities and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled a weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after it was reported that its campaign manager for North Carolina in February had pointed a gun at an employee while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he waited months for the matter to be resolved internally before realizing that "it would not happen".
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drawn a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and struck the run in Vincent's knee", Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage", Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed a judge.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint calls for damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for physical injury and permanent mental harm.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, was not available for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign associate.
He's been on the phone with his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, but hasn't responded.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, High Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before the country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) will see significant losses for the SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the black and red government coalition could rule in the north for a short time, this is not possible according to the Berlin survey.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party is thus just ahead of the CDU, which could reach 23 percent, according to the poll.
The third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The Left would be 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent), while the AfD would be represented in Parliament for the first time with 19 per cent.
The Greens are re-entering the Schwerin parliament with a slight loss of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
The NDP and the FDP would not be represented in the Land Parliament at 3 per cent each.
In the Berlin parliamentary election, the SPD was only 23 percent (election 2011: 28,3 percent), according to the survey.
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still 19 percent behind the Greens (2011: 17.6 percent), but 15 percent ahead of the Left (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14%.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry, unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: the first smartphone
Email and the Internet in the blink of an eye: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times the weight of an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't in the right hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty cluttered.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now being shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came on the market exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices online, but they're sort of from the Stone Age of the Internet.
But 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as "a Western pocket-sized office".
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for the standards of the time: text and e-mail could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was reachable.
Even access to websites was possible through HTML browsers, albeit at a painful pace.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a little keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-marks, or about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one in August 1996 could have imagined that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's changed since then.
Smartphones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually being sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market today is dominated by providers who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime, anywhere is a commonplace for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices have been sold, of which 555 million are on Samsung and Apple alone.
The worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-run businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now developed around the smartphone.
The big breakthrough came in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and an Internet communicator, all easily operated on a touch screen.
Apple's victory march began, and today the iPhone is the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the reputation.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian providers like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away", said Janina Kugel, head of the Siemens staffing board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and to all of London, but to the whole country.
To me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like it was in London in 2012, when we made a big effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics were a big win for Stratford and the East End.
And we will do that again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new teaching jobs for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport area.
As they did in London 2012, there will be those who think the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too great.
I was told that England would never be ready for the games and that we would embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and they'll be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he's asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not for individuals.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who have implemented an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years running, to T2 - which is built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to provide a third ladder, supported by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for Great Britain and I'm confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It is time we steered this Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" about ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, one software maker says that trying to avoid ad blocking is like "cat and mouse".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to again block social network advertising.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and the outsiders has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers", and that it's possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
A study last year by Pagefair and Adobe found that around 200 million people worldwide use ad blocker, almost four times as many as in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has targeted ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for social networking and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth investing in such a move.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "Ad Preference Tool" to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks' new filters would be of concern because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a dull medium, which is why we've instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman allegedly killed herself by overtaking a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit by a multiple vehicle on a highway in the early hours of Thursday morning in a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and was hit by several cars, police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, tried to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have yet to be identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to report.
An investigation has been launched, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gille's Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision averted?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide", Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person walked in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists should not assume that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent homicide after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman - who had responded to an emergency call - was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely unusual and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with any further information about Thursday's incident near Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model projections, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could have once exhibited Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and yet was slowly moving forward.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but it once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the Sun for almost two months", GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Although it was once believed to be habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When they were deprived of hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, leading the team's decision-making process to a low voting rights.
Colorado's alternate president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision, noting that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", said Roy, 50, in a statement.
I've been thinking a lot and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team, to give it more depth, to take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision", Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.
Roy was named the league's best coach during his 2013-14 Avalanches debut season as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was swept by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches posted a 39-39-4 record in 2015-16 and fell behind the Wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two games with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
The negotiators said that the labour struggles over the pay of North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
'Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,' it said in a joint statement.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next year, to re-address the problems.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates on its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10% decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the space to get through the market downturn.
Shell has for its part laid off thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business as a result of its mega merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation exacerbated by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in a generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea was important for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many, not just a few", he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared with an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the pleiadian cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiadian cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star cluster and how the rotation periods relate to the formation of the planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we can learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiadian cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're turning fastest now.
At peak rotational rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by identifying the time between the appearance of a noticeable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars rotating slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars", Rebull said.
Because the star cluster is so close to the Pleiades, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The pleiadian cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older", Rebull said.
We have much to learn about, such as how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes" so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star is stepping down
Tears ran faster on Alex Rodriguez than the American baseball star in his best days from base to base.
After announcing his emotional retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey one last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
"I love this game and this team".
"I say goodbye to both of them", explained the 14-time All-Star of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was voted the league's Most Valuable Player three times, and won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His ten-year contract has earned him $27 million a year since 2007.
He will continue to work as a youth coach and advisor until the end of his contract on 31 December 2017.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it off with performance for a long time.
He hit .314 with 696 home runs, 314 hits and 2021 runs scored for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar numbers in the main statistics.
But the 41-year-old is still not expected to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his performance off the field.
In 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN that he took banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is believed to be the prime suspect in receiving performance enhancing funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league might have done me a favor for 2014, because I've been playing for 20 years without a break", Rodriguez said sufficiently.
His goodbye days don't go quietly either.
While many baseball legends have once again won the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour".
"My job involves trying to win every game", said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans of the Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the fans sang in the 4:9 loss to the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Caught: Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to run in Rio because of a positive doping test.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases were announced at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of the already critically-acclaimed athletics competition - these news are timely.
Chen had been tested for the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, as early as last Sunday.
The International Court of Sports (CAS) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the 100m butterfly final, missing the bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to be in the 50m freestyle.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-sample and hold a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and calls on Chen to cooperate fully in the investigation", Xinhua quoted a statement saying: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Justice and will accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases, but the CAS.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekowa spread, and the 33-year-old went into the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive", she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be supplements", the athlete explained.
The report says that the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was suspended for a while, and according to BNT, the B sample is also positive.
The Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately responded with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes are not drawing the right conclusions", he said. "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded".
For example, all weightlifters from the nation that is chronically doped cannot participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of Adrian Zielinski, the London Olympic champion in the 85kg class, was also reported, as was his brother Tomasz, who three days earlier tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to run in the 94 kg class.
The Danekowa case in particular is another serious blow to the reputation of the sport as a whole.
The IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from the race, except for one exception, because of systematic doping, and the Kenyan national team produced many bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the past offences in China also caused violent fighting between the athletes.
This is how the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang is peeing purple".
"When I see the podium above 200 metres freestyle, I want to surrender", Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also the focus of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time or respect for doping fraudsters", he said.
Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetacidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but was only suspended for three months.
Data theft: These treacherous hackers are blackmailing their ransom money
Now, blackmail malware programmers are targeting companies and they're doing it successfully.
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany by malware defense experts, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been the victims of at least one, or sometimes multiple, blackmail software attack in the past 12 months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have been targeted by ransomware.
Forty percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The attackers are specializing their blackmail software, according to malware bytes, in an effort to attack corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the potential ransom money to be blackmailed falls significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing a terribly rapid evolution of malware", explains Marcin Kleczynski, head of Malwarebytes, in an interview with the World.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks has been terribly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files, such as Word, Excel, or database files, and for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
Then the software presents the demands of the blackmailer.
To get the final encryption code to the files, victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where private users are concerned with the personal photo database, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stalled.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware attacks.
Twenty-two percent of the German companies affected reported loss of revenue from ransomware, 13 percent even had to shut down completely, and in one case, people were at risk.
In Germany, hospitals have already suffered attacks on several occasions, where patients may be at acute risk of losing their medical records.
"We always tell victims not to pay, you are only promoting the problem", explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to refuse the perpetrators' demands given the downtime in the operation.
The hackers know that and they're doing everything they can to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to collect more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay with bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites, or decrypt example files for free.
And if individuals are rescued after paying a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware in about a week".
However, it is more likely that there are three or four persons involved.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual blackmailer.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The delivery package includes a customization tool to change smaller configurations, appearance and branding", says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then seek out other hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal, and then you assign another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then hire spammers to distribute it", explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that are better at securing their data.
Over 50 percent of the corporate IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey trust ransomware to be able to fight back with file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"When encryption of data alone is no longer a threat to successful corruption, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations", explains Marcin Kleczynski, head of Malwarebytes.
The potential for damage is thus many times higher than before depending on the type of data.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the basis of the information available to it.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how to get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heater could be a ransom for some of these victims.
If the perpetrators in the future, instead of heating, block an entire manufacturing road in a factory, ransomware could become a problem in Industry 4.0.
One for all
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overwhelming, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, appears rather small, passengers have plenty of room in both the front row and the back, and it doesn't seem too tight anywhere.
The materials inside are well-processed and look pleasant, only the top of the cockpit falls off a little.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.
Not only is there 453 litres of luggage available for raised and 1026 litres for folded backs, but there are the "magic seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the back seat surfaces can be folded up like movie theaters, providing storage space up to 6 feet [1.24 m] from the floor to the ceiling.
The boot is well loaded, but the load height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to torque up to 300 Nm in wide speeds.
He should be doing his job a little slower, though.
The daily consumption of 4.7 litres/100 km is pleasant.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre gasoline engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not available.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the direction should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top-level variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (operating up to 32), the Collision Warning System and the Tracking Assist.
The collision warner is sometimes irritated by the fact that he evaluates many obstacles as "coming objects" when ranking.
The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent timekeeper responds to traffic sign recognition and slows down the speed if necessary.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top-of-the-line equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI boxes are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest that much, you get a gasoline engine from 20,000 euros, a diesel engine from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The German authorities have not yet established a legal basis for the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women.
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
The Court of Justice has held that the accident could have happened anywhere, but that it was a general risk to life.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any compensation.
If sick: When the organiser pays
Sick vacationers will only get their money back after their trip if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms.
In the case under discussion, a family suffered from severe diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent almost all of her vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers to a faulty sewage treatment plant that allegedly contaminated the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was flawed and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.
The cleaning system was indeed defective.
But the organizer did not find out until shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume that the seawater was fine.
So he didn't violate his duty to inform, the verdict said.
Especially since the water samples didn't show any contaminants.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly from contagion - is a common life risk.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The State must react prudently and decisively to terrorist threats.
The only thing that is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.
But if criminals were to leave the country faster, it would increase security and also increase the public's acceptance of refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further strengthening of security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years".
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has already taken the view that the Commission should be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures taken are not distorted.
The aim is to improve video surveillance, to revise the law on guns so that, above all, it makes it difficult to buy guns online.
The last much-discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be maintained, de Maizière said.
However, he wants to look in dialogue with the medical community for solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said, for example, in view of mental disorders.
The Minister believes that better social care is necessary to combat the radicalisation of refugees.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
In order to pursue criminals in specific areas of the Internet (the dark net), de Maizière plans to use undercover investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has spoken clearly against actionism.
"This was a blow to the sharp-makers in the CDU/CSU", Gabriel told the newspapers of the Sponge Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full coverage constitutional problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, like traffic or witnesses in court.
Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of using new anti-terrorism packages to simulate the strength and the capacity to act.
Left Party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet proverbs and a tightening of residence rights do not bring security to the people of this country".
Improved traffic flow on the motorway provider
It's regularly parked on the bypass - here's a picture from November.
But that is to change: the legal tender is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are stuck in the traffic on the surrounding road every night when driving over the motorway (A43).
The national road construction company will extend the right-of-way by 700 metres on Tuesday and Wednesday (16-17 August) between Hammer Street and Wesel Road.
Drivers can then drive straight from Hammer Road to the right.
The major advantage is that traffic splits up more early, improving overall traffic on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea for the extended exit came from the CDU faction in the Münster-West district representation.
The narrowing of the road on the Zubringer annoys motorists especially between 5 and 7 p.m.
On working days, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Alberslohe road and sometimes even beyond.
The needlehole is on B51 just outside the Wesel Road exit.
From here, traffic will only be directed through the highway bridge.
The second trail had to be rebuilt about three quarters of a century ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the capacity to carry heavy goods, especially two-lane traffic.
The competent national authority cannot say how long this congestion and the associated workday congestion will continue.
However, it is expected to take years, as the bridge has an official residual useful life until 2034.
In order to extend the legal tender procedure, the national company has deliberately chosen the less congested time during the school holidays, because disabilities are to be expected.
Traffic is driven by the construction site on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
Intercultural travel: cultural offerings for schools
The international class of the Forest School attended the play "The Invisible House".
Nima's and the Young Theatre are planning a musical project.
Nima's Association enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning play "The invisible house" at the Münster Youth Theatre.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 pupils between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the staging in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims to integrate young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds into the cultural life of the city, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the students in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and spoke little German.
The choreography, the stage pictures and the video animations have enabled them to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Münster Young Theatre.
Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg of Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will be working together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migrant backgrounds between 14 and 20 years old should have the opportunity to attend professionally-guided courses in singing, dance, acting and music.
The programme is designed to provide a range of services for children and families in theatre and theatre language.
The project "Intercultural Travel" is continuing.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of starburst: Hope for better weather
The weather in southwestern Germany on Friday night has made a dent in the count - but there is still hope.
The night was not well suited to watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies in the night of Saturday.
If the weather is good, we'll see a lot of starbursts in the sky.
The constellations are Perseids, which at 216,000 kilometers per hour are among the fastest.
They are named because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful nights: Tips for sleep problems
At night you wander around forever, at night you stay awake for hours, and in the morning you are far from waking up to no longer think about sleep.
It's anything but relaxing.
After all, such problems are a good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel that their sleep is often or permanently unresting.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by many different causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood as insomnia, is a sleep disorder.
Many people find it especially unsatisfying or inadequate to sleep well, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of directors of the German Homeopathic Association, which has a practice in Lower Saxony's Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This can be due to organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also to medications.
Often, sleep disorders are the expression of another condition.
"Waking up early is especially common in depression", says Weeß.
And it could be that different factors are related.
For example, a person who has a stroke may not lie down well, wakes up every two to three hours, and may start to ponder everyday problems and worries, Weeß says.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you see a doctor for sleep problems?
If you are not sleeping well for at least three nights a week for a month and are affected during the day, see a doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can be quite different: you are depressed, tired, sleepless, have trouble paying attention and concentrating, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out what causes them.
The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - traditional sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep doctors in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre at Charité University Berlin.
Therefore, if you have trouble sleeping, you should first consult a doctor, advises Weeß.
He can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who's going to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For example, doctors advise sleep laboratory tests for snoring with respirators, sickness during the day, sleepwalking, or if the cause of a sleep disorder is not found, Fietze explains.
You don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should have a normal day.
"Please don't sleep at lunch", says Fietze.
After the wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on your body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest belt and a finger sensor.
And a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected cope?
There are quite a few replacement screws you can use for better sleep.
Wise counts for: regular bedtime and wake-up time, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to sleep, not drinking alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - you start counting right away, and that is not good at all.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed his disappointment on Facebook about the DSV team's results at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won his first gold at the World Short Course Championships in Doha, setting his first world record.
Now former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting himself from his critically acclaimed former teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000€ and a jungle king gets 150,000€, no one should be surprised at the lack of medals", the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The system of promotion in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at or even operate doping.
"I am not saying that controls should be stopped here", he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to report to the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before he first started.
This is exactly how countries should be treated.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain period before the World Cup/ODI cannot participate", demands the Hamburg-based voter, who now operates an ice cream shop.
Airport: Gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf airport
The Dusseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had been involved in several thefts of bags and luggage as a gang.
Around 9:30 p.m., civilian officials at Düsseldorf Airport recovered a gang known to police officers from past thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year, and they had been committed collectively, part-time and particularly professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four acts against the thieves who had come to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they had plundered over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, some linden trees, and a few more headstones in between: Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like it at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk down the street from east to west, you'll see playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten, and a biology shop.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the façade of a gray house.
A new building is being built in front of a lidl that is to be demolished soon: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here by 2017.
However, in recent weeks articles about this "trending district", as the property company Friedrichshain calls it, have been preferably illustrated with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once occupied, now the residents have leases, but the ground floor still occupies rooms and is used for events.
Henkel, the Berlin resident, in particular, had repeatedly spoken out against the police's harsh treatment of the project since the beginning of the year, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the caddy forge, were cleared on June 22 with 300 police officers, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground, blocking parts of the road and preventing visitors from entering the 94 home.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents take their children for walks, people sit on the sidewalk outside the houses in the sun, others talk before it's too late.
In the immediate vicinity of the housing projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share with the residents of the housing projects the concern about rising rent and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a voter who wanted a majority of the police protection from vandalism on the left.
The trench that the Berlin Innensator and the police open between the owners of the house and their neighbors, apparently, does not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighbourhood, which still today has a low average income and a high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
The construction of houses and the housing projects that result from them have long been part of the policy: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street, very close to the Riga river.
While Mainz was cleared under heavy police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects in Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and Berliners from all over the world in recent years: residents from the GDR and former homeowners now share their tents with them.
This is also evident in rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognizable by discarded discs or freshly painted facades that have been painted with painted buttons.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year with the words "left-wing autonomic violence".
One reason not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: statistics show that crimes like assault are almost exclusively directed at police officers.
The majority of the crimes are property damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94, there is no question of uncertainty.
As for violence, it's alarming: the people in '94 are their neighbors, who certainly weren't.
Even the famous burning cars have long since disappeared from the Riga River.
For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more out of each other than anywhere else".
New builder deliberately moved to Rigaer Street and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that the people get their streets back: from the police, the politics and the media, who all of a sudden claimed the supremacy of the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like new builders, the street continues to be taken away from them: faceless new buildings in former buildings that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately apartments that are not interesting to many people here - people who are not as well-built are more likely to live here", she says.
"I cannot condone violence and destruction".
But what do you do when no one listens?
There's frustration everywhere, including the police and the residents.
For those who are angry about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene were part of the kiez.
A person who moves should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a bar neighborhood can be very uncomfortable with noise.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.
She's also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been Urbach's refugee representative.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
It is a contact point for all actors: refugees, the refugee workforce, the administration, the authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the egg-laying woolly cat that has a problem above all.
This is what some, less mocking than targeting the large number of job areas, had in mind when the administration wanted to eliminate the job.
The aim was to find a manager with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in social work, who was a legendary woolly cow.
But administrative work is not her main area, says Annika Deuschle.
It is mainly about organisation, working with people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been with the agency for about six weeks.
She's been holding a 50 percent position for three years.
"It's high time", says Regine Kunde, "that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and official actors.
There are problems big and small, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be on the Wasen Road
A serious problem has been for some time finding housing for the acceding refugees who have been recognised.
The local authorities are responsible for the transmission of the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented accommodation.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation facilities must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Land Council to the Municipality and the Job Centre.
Problem: There are free facilities, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
The administration is not actually finding private housing.
It has not worked so far, according to Deuschle, if you are dependent on private dwellings.
The Commission has therefore decided to amend the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
So soon, new containers will be put up on Wasen Street.
But it's not just the housing sector.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to permanent residence, traineeships, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants must be found or set up.
"More seats would be good", reports Regine Customer.
Many work in the yard or help housekeepers, doing charitable work - and this is motivated and very neat, reports Annika Deuschle.
She hopes that the work for the community will have a positive external impact.
It's not "employment therapy".
But activity is not just work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and client.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers like sports, contact with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So this is where administration and volunteers come in.
It is essential that the refugees feel welcome and wanted in Germany.
The length of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it's just taking time and that they can make a meaningful transition through time, for example, through language courses.
If you ever feel like you can't help anyone in Urbach, you can't work and you're useless, you'll never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
But there are also problems, says Kunde honestly, "people who can't do anything".
This is all a "mother's mission".
