Members of the Welsh Assembly are disturbed by the similarity to the puppet.
Some members of the Assembly are seriously concerned about the proposal to change their current title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue arose because of the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from different political parties are concerned about being ridiculed.
A Labour member of the Assembly says his group is concerned that the TWP is merging with the PWP".
For the non-Welsh reader: in Welsh twp means clever and pwp means shy.
And a member of the assembly from the Plaid Party said that his team was not happy and presented several alternative names.
Conservatives in Wales said they were "out of the loop" with the new name, but noted that MWP sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context the Welsh letter w is pronounced as u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly committee, which is currently working on a bill to introduce a new name, says: "The final decision on any definition of the name of the members of the Assembly, of course, is made by the members themselves".
The Welsh Assembly Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public review of the options, where it gained wide support for a proposal to name the Assembly after the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of Assembly Members, the Commission chose the name Member of the Welsh Parliament, or WPM, but the MWP variant gained more support in public debate.
Members of the Assembly are still choosing alternatives, so reaching a consensus will be the concern of the chair, Ellen John, who is due to introduce the amendment bill in a few weeks.
The reform bill also includes other changes to the Assembly's work, including rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the scheme of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians hold referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to adopt the country's new name, the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was called in response to a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbor is a name for its claims to territory and has consistently opposed its share of EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on the name change, says he will not attend the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a cost of joining the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's have gone off because of the lack of churches in Harlem.
"The people of the Yucatan people I spoke to said that historically every neighborhood had a bar and a church", Mr. Adams said.
Today, none of them are.
He said the bars were missing.
"People interact differently today", he said.
The bars are no longer the dark places where the neighbors used to go all the time.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets may not last as long as the leaders predict, and that sooner or later they will be right back where they started.
Churches could be replaced by co-operative housing buildings, where people who do not care for the churches in the neighborhood can live, he added.
Because the vast majority of the building owners in the co-ops will be white, he said, so they're going to speed up the day when all these churches close, because the people who move into these co-ops aren't going to be coming to these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the City Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The neighboring black congregation won the building rights.
St. Martin's Church was acquired by the Congregation of the Cause of the Blessed John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the main shopping district of Harlem, 125th Street, against vendors who refused to hire and encourage black people.
In 1939 a fire severely damaged the building, but because Father Johnson's parish priest had drawn up a plan for its rebuilding, the bell was rung.
St. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir, proudly called this carillon the "Reclamation of the Whig people".
In July, the Carillion Performer Expert called it another name: "Cultural Treasure" and "Immeasurable Historical Instrument".
Tiffany Ngm, an expert from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was a carillon played by Dionysius A. Lind, the world's first black musician, who moved to a larger carillon in a Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwelther said St. Martin's did not change it.
In the last few months, what has been done at St. Martin's is a complex task of architects and contractors, some brought in by the chaplain's assistants, the rest by the bishop's parish.
The parish council - the governing body of the parish church, which consists of assistant chaplains - wrote to the parish in July with concerns that the parish was being handed over expenses to the parish council, even though the latter was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some in the congregation expressed concern about the lack of transparency on the parish side.
Zwigen identified a 13-year-old cyborg collector in California
According to official reports, on the opening day of the California crab season on Sunday, a lizard attacked a 13-year-old boy who was freezing to collect crab sharks.
The attack occurred at approximately 7:00 a.m. in Encinitas, near Shukurá Beach.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that after a half hour of freezing on Saturday morning, he heard a boy screaming for help and he and his friends quickly swam out of the water to help him.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was a cry of cyborg enthusiasm, but then he realized it was a cry of a mickey!
It's gone!
"When I got closer, I saw that the lid was completely open", Hamel said.
When they were all out of the water, I shouted, 'Zhivgeni has come into the water!'
The boy was flown by helicopter to San Diego Regional Children's Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of lizard attacked.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a lizard had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but said the species was not a threat.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Police have imposed a 48-hour beach curfew from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security purposes.
Gills noted that there are more than 135 species of lizards in these areas, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Unlike Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, Sainsbury's offers customers cosmetics supplied by supermarket chain stores and specialists on site to help.
The £2.8 billion market for cosmetics continues to grow as sales of clothing and household goods plummet, a key differentiator in the attack on such a market, with cosmetics delivered from supermarket-like wide shelves being tested in 11 major stores across the country and, if successful, added to more stores next year.
Cosmetics are being invested in because supermarkets are preying on shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves, and other household items.
Sainsbury's says it will double its cosmetics list to 3,000 brands, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be further diversified into stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is resuming the sale of its boutique make-up products that do not contain animal products and are suitable for vegans, a product that is rapidly growing in demand among younger consumers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will be a trial at Sainsbury's in two markets, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the other at the end of the year in Sale Oak, Birmingham.
The shift to online shopping and the daily shopping of small shops for a small amount of food is forcing supermarket owners to work harder to attract visitors.
Mike Coope, CEO of Sainsbury's, says outlets will be very much like universes as supermarket chains try to compete with the often discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more service and inferior products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of supermarkets, and has also developed many Habitats since buying both of these chains two years ago, thereby improving food sales and making shopping more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to transform its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tried to merge with Boots, but they could not agree on how to share the revenue from its supermarket pharmacies.
Sainsbury's launched its new strategy three years ago by selling 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was to play its part in this plan, expanding into four markets with more high-end skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's, says: "We changed the air and introduced the consumer to a shelf full of cosmetics.
There are also specially trained personnel who are ready to help.
Our range of brands meets all requirements, and our attractive environment and convenient location make our traditional shopping a serious competition.
Peter Jones is disappointed that Holly Willoughby has terminated his £11 million contract.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was angered by the behaviour of TV presenter Holly Willoughby when Holly terminated her £11 million business contract with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new business with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for homewear and accessories for their Truly brand.
The couple's business was connected to the late Pelthorough's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby's Dragons' Den star Peter Jones was disappointed when he left the lucrative business of their lifestyle brand at the last minute to devote all his time to a new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "shocked" when the TV golden girl revealed at a tense meeting at the Mallow headquarters of her business empire in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that her new £1.5 million deal leaves no time for her to re-engage with their underwear and accessories brand Truly.
The business is linked to the late Peter's brand Goop and was hoping to double Willab's approximately £11 million business.
When 37-year-old Willab announced via Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK for one of her summer villas.
A source says that "Truly Hall" was a top priority.
It was his long-term job, and he was going to be doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to resign was absolutely outrageous to everyone involved.
No one could understand what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to the beginning.
Mallow's headquarters is full of goods for sale".
Experts have suggested that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's highest-earning celebrities, will cost the company millions as it has invested heavily in everything from pillows and candles to clothing and pajamas, and is likely to delay their launch.
It would also be the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willab and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Kappe for ten years.
Willab started with Truly Cap in 2016, and in March Jones, 52, joined them as chairman.
In addition to spending the holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin Television Productions.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we would not comment on Jim's business activities.
After a difficult conversation, we fell in love.
He joked that the news media would criticize him, some would consider it a non-presidential comment, and also disapprove of his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so expensive?
Said Trump in a voice that was like a telepath.
I left nothing.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump's first meeting in Singapore in June to take a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have failed.
Three months after meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's disarmament efforts.
Instead, he added, the United States is continuing sanctions designed to maintain tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his closing remarks.
"Our business with North Korea is going very well", he said.
There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
And now we have a great relationship.
He said his efforts to mend ties with Kim had yielded positive results - completing missile tests, helping to free hostages, and returning remaining American service members home.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"Presidential behavior is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into the state-of-the-art arena, we have 200 people here", Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd in front of them.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds
To assess the effects of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population is displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, which is a little bit concerning", Ms Sumba said.
While Save the Children is already preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear if foreign workers will be working on site.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian government officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international agencies to help.
If we consider the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, we can say that the country is completely unprepared for natural disasters.
Southeast Asia has built tsunami shelters, but you don't see that in other regions.
It turned out that the lack of a tsunami warning system in Palu, despite being known, was one of the reasons for the high death toll.
Traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is quite difficult even in good weather.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok is on its way to Palou to treat earthquake victims, but it will take three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo's campaign focused on improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure and invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration has been hampered by funding problems as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also has a problem of sectarian conflict in Indonesia, where Muslims are the most conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced in clashes between Christians and Muslims using machetes, whips and other weapons in the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturge hits a high ball into Chelsea's goal
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturge received a call from Harden Sugar about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team were leading 1-0.
He passed the ball with his left foot before hitting the bone.
The high kick went over the top of the penalty and landed in the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell from the top of the pitcher, Kepa Arizabalaga, into the net.
It was just trying to get into position to get the ball and chess players always push as far forward as they can, so I was just trying to have as much time as possible", Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant coming and I played with one touch, I didn't think much, I just hit him.
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute of the first half with a Belgian star Eden Hazard's goal.
Then the Blues' striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic with a whip before he sent the ball from the centre of the field into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic got in the middle of the field and quickly hit the wall.
Then he made a beautifully punched pass that put Azar in the penalty box.
Azaria evaded the defence and a left-footed shot to the back of the net went into the net of Liverpool's Alison Becker.
At 3pm on Wednesday, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, Liverpool face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League.
Chelsea play their UEFA Europa League match at 3pm on Thursday at Videotone, London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832 on Sunday morning, according to the National Disaster Management Agency.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, sending waves as high as 20 feet, the service's press secretary, Sotopo Purvo, told a news conference.
The city of Palo, home to 380,000 people, is in ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman who was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found dead with a fatal gunshot wound in John Street Grayson Mews at 7:55 a.m.
Police are calling in people in the surrounding areas who have seen or heard anything about the case.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I ask anyone in the John Street area of Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything on video to contact us, as this information may be vital to the investigation.'
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local and was found in a residential building.
The next morning, friends who knew the dead woman came to the scene to ask where she had been found this morning.
An investigation is underway, police say, as they try to notify the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson, Missouri, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He couldn't say anything when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would take several hours for the investigation to be completed before he was allowed back into the building.
A police officer was telling a man that this whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman who was crying.
He kept saying, "That's terrible".
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the perimeter line, another outside.
Several officers were watching the apartments from inside the perimeter.
Anyone with information can DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crime Stoppers at 0800 555 111 with the September 30 recording 247.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monumental hit in the chain of re-writing history
His depiction is an artistic punishment for the Taliban's incursion and destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in England by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwellian community calls Mr Crick's proposal "ridiculous" and characterizes it as an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, says: "In the recent debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The battle against traditional belief was neither ordered nor undertaken by Cromwell in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps another Cromwell will be punished for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Thornycroft's remarkable work is a fine testament to the 19th century attitude toward Cromwell and forms part of the historiography of a person many feel deserves to be appreciated today.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps more so in the second half of the 19th century than today, but still, Cromwell is seen by many as the protector of Parliament from outside pressure when the monarch is attacked.
The historical debate about how accurate this representation is still ongoing.
But one thing we can say with certainty is that in the 17th century, conflict gave impetus to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell was a key player on one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of note and respect.
A killer pig stabbed a Chinese farmer to death
In southwest China, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market, local media reports.
A man with a damaged artery, bleeding, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found dead in a market near a pig farm in the southern Chinese province of Jiangzhou in the village of Liangshui on Sunday morning.
Another pig prepares vaccines for pigs in a pig pen in the town of Sinin, Xinjiang province, China, May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he reportedly went to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and noticed that the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big old pig at the station with blood on it.
Forensics confirmed that a 550-pound bull ran over and killed a farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and frozen", said the cousin, who goes by the name Wu in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked away in isolation to prevent another attack while police gathered material.
It is said that there are negotiations between Yuan's family members and market executives regarding compensation for his death.
It's rare, but pig attacks on humans have happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man severely paralyzed.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig from a Welsh farmer hit his tractor before his terrified wife threw it out.
When a pig was eaten by a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not generally aggressive, but the taste of blood can give them a boost.
They're just playing.
Their children are very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
"You just have to treat them with enough respect", he said.
Hurricane Rosa followed by widespread heavy rains in the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it approaches the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be followed in the coming days by flood-inducing rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa reached 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m., a Category 1 storm, at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north this week.
Meanwhile, storm surge is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and it is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa Bay approaches the California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, heavy tropical moisture will move northward across the southwestern United States.
Monday's showers will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching thunderstorm to create a large-scale rainfall pattern in the southwest.
In places, one to four inches of precipitation will cause uncontrolled waterfalls, canyons and possibly even avalanches in desert areas.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall to increase to 2-3 inches per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Unforeseen falls can occur in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the turbulent nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be especially foolish to go out and walk in the open in a tropical storm with the threat of rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and hail can cause high winds and dust storms.
The approaching storm will bring intermittent heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
The total amount of precipitation can be half an inch, causing small crevasses and road debris.
This will be the first heavy rainfall in the region during the wet season.
The rainfall will reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with more rainfall expected on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Thursday.
Expect frequent temperature swings in the United States in October as the Arctic gets colder, but it's still quite hot in the tropics.
Sometimes this will cause a dramatic temperature difference in the surrounding areas.
An example of a sharp temperature change will be in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference will be 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will continue to try to strengthen and expand.
The central and eastern United States will experience a mild early October wind that will extend from 80 degrees south of the Plains to some areas of the Northeast.
New York City could see temperatures reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast for the first half of October indicates a higher than average temperature probability in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched the interview with Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched a haunting testimony Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on Six Network.
Meanwhile, political wrangling continued, with broadcasters interrupting the program for a last-minute change on Friday: a deal arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had drunkenly washed his hands and tried to wash his clothes at a senior party.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional statement, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It appears that over 20.4 million people watched it, according to a Nielsen report released on Friday.
The company measured the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no data available at the time from other networks that also broadcast this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And also, Nielsen has a hard time usually figuring out how many people are watching in their offices.
To put it objectively, that's the number of people who watch football playoffs or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose pundits strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led the day with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC's score was 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
After listening, the interest remained high.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After the moderation, the Republican office officially told the press that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS caught him screaming as he tried to get into the elevator for a legal committee hearing on Friday morning.
He stood there with his eyes closed for a few minutes as they argued with him, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you", one woman told me.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They told her, "You have power, whereas so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office released a statement saying that before the elevator closed, he could have said more at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks were live-streaming hours later as the Judiciary Committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said I would only do that if I knew that the FBI would be investigating the charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority would make.
Flake was partially convinced when he spoke to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Coon and then a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics with Britain's future" and ignoring national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
While his interview is on the front page of the paper, a second interview is published alongside it, in which his former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, criticizes his so-called Brexit checker plan and says that the goal of bringing Britain and the European Union together on tariffs is completely absurd.
Wade Sims shot dead, police arrested LSU quarterback Dayton Simpson on suspicion of murder
Police have arrested a 20-year-old LSU basketball player for the fatal shooting of Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was taken into custody and is in jail on charges of second-degree murder, the M.R.I.P.D. said.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson confronting each other, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene, and CBS affiliate WAFB reports that Simpson's DNA was found on them.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to shooting Wade deliberately.
His monetary liability was estimated at $350,000, his lawyer said.
The East M. Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, specifically to the thigh.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Crime Detection Team, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and the citizens of the district for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the shooter.
LSU athletic director Joe Aleva thanked the county for their thorough and consistent investigation.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"I'm always nervous about this", Wade said.
The volcano's ash reached Mexico City
The eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Sunday, after activity reached the crater and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded in 24 hours, the National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano.
The center is picking up a lot of rumbling and shaking.
Social media images showed a thin layer of butterfly on a car crusher in the Hoshimilco neighborhood of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Wadon Goyosu has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and police, as thousands joined a protest demonstration to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized vote to secede.
A group of masked separatist supporters were stopped by security police who fired eggs and pepper spray, creating dark clouds of dust on streets usually crowded with tourists.
Another police encounter occurred on the same day that the officers were handcuffed.
For several hours, pro-independence protesters chanted "Oblivion, disgrace", followed by pro-unity protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were rescued from minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region, a year after Madrid's illegal declaration of an October 1 referendum, as Catalan separatists celebrate the rain.
Many people voted for independence, but more anti-secessionists boycotted the referendum.
Catalan officials said about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the referendum and clashes broke out in the region's polling stations.
Pro-independence groups camped out all night on Friday to stop demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstration was forced to continue down another route.
Narcis Thermes, 68, an electrician, took part in a separatist protest with his wife, saying he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
Last year we had our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they had the opportunity to vote for independence, but now we're stuck", she said.
Despite a vital, if minor, victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence parties in Catalonia are struggling to keep pace this year as many of their well-known leaders have either voluntarily fled the country or are in detention and awaiting court rulings for their role in organising the referendum and the resulting declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording the protest on his mobile phone in support of police, says the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing", he said.
Oriol Sanchez, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed last year and awaiting trial, said on Saturday he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
Running for European elections is the best way to declare the degradation of democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish authorities", he said.
London: Several men arrested for crashing into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car re-entered a house in London.
The incident happened at Ballynagar Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
According to Detective Inspector Bob Blemings, the glass and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point, the car was fired on.
Mango's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Mango's first goal brought Livingston victory
Livingston's lead forced Rangers to hand over Steven Gerrard to manage the Ibrox club after just their second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Mango's goal proved the difference, with Harry Holt's team moving up to the second tier with Hibernian.
Gerard's side are unbeaten in the Premier League this season and next week they face the leaders, Hartz, who they are eight points behind.
In the meantime, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its unbeaten run in the division with six games remaining, with head coach Holt still undefeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed his chances with the visitors
Holt's team had to be relegated long before they scored, their direct play in all areas was a problem for Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a good cut, but the one in front of the gate missed the shot, then Alan Lithgow could take a head shot across Craig Holcutt's door only to get to the door.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they would cause problems for the visitors from the standard situations after the game resumed.
And that was the tactic that got the ball passed.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston worked his way into the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to deliver the mango, which received a touchdown and scored from the penalty area.
At that point, the Rangers had the advantage of possession, but the defense was unassailable, and the batter Liam Kelly was not a problem.
This situation continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos scored and Kelly opened the goal.
Scott Pittman's batting Ranger was kicked by Alan McGregor, and Lithgow also kicked from a distance in another standard Livingston position.
There were constant penalty shootouts for Livingston and the ball was always taken out of the penalty area, although two penalties were called - one for replacing Holkitt with Glenn Middleton and another for playing with his other hand - both of which missed the goal.

Livingston's phenomenal game and score.
All of them as one, brilliant players, consistently exceeding expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and lineup have changed significantly since their return to the top flight, but special thanks go to Holt for putting them in the team's starting lineup since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Holkitt was a relentless, highly organized head of security, and the manga never gave Connor Goldson and Joe Oral a break.
Besides, the Rangers were short of inspiration.
They're sometimes very good under Gerard, but this time they're falling far short of that standard.
They missed their final ball - they only hit the home team once - it's time for Rangers to wake up, they're in the middle of the table.
The Turkish government has also been trying to prevent the Turkish government from using the funds.
There were many smiles and many blue skies at the Turkish and German leaders' lunch meeting in Berlin on Saturday.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
They have different views on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Kioln for the opening of a new giant mosque.
It is home to the largest number of Turks living outside Turkey.
Police blocked a gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque for security reasons, but a large crowd of supporters still gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - including many Kurds - also tried to make their voices heard, criticizing both Erdogan's policies and the German authorities' decision to invite him to their country.
The duel protests the different attitudes towards the visitor, the German Turks calling him a hero, the others an autocrat.
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred on Childers Street a few months after another cyclist died, about a mile from the previous Sunday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working to identify the man and would notify immediate family.
The road has been closed and buses diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the prison official said.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 0930 BST and is still ongoing.
Special Torch Officers are called in to handle a situation involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
Officers were dispatched to the scene with minor facial injuries.
A prison press secretary said: "HMP Long Larin has specially trained prison staff involved in the ongoing riot control process.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We are not condoning violence in prisons, we are making it clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and will have to spend more time outside the prisons.
HMP Long Latin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
The report states that in June, the warden of the prison was hospitalized after a prisoner shot himself.
And last October, law enforcement officers were called in to quell a major prison riot in which employees were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (later locations may be beneficial)
Tropical depressions are rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what's going to happen early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moves toward the deserted southwest, likely followed by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood watch for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday in the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only eight tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models suggest 2 to 4 inches of hail, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Moline Rim, Arizona.
Desert in other areas of the southwest, including Central Rock and the Great Basin, is likely to be 1 or 2 inches, while total isolation can be up to 4 inches.
For those who are in danger of sudden flooding, the rose rain can be beneficial, as the region is very arid.
While flooding is a very serious concern, some heavy rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently in a drought.
According to the United States Weather Bureau, 40 percent of Arizona is in extreme drought, the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa's trail heads for the Mexican side of the Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, still a storm on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm interacts with the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and so it calms down.
So, we expect a tropical storm-force thunderstorm in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rain in parts of Mexico could be very heavy, with a serious risk of flooding.
A total of 3-6 inches of heavy rain is expected in northwestern San Fernando Bay, California, with up to 10 inches of precipitation, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona and reach southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
The main threat from the storm or its debris is very heavy rain in northwestern Sonoran Bay, California and desert regions of the United States, the National Hurricane Center says.
These rains are expected to be followed by life-threatening waterfalls and gorges in the desert as well as torrential downpours in the mountainous region.
The Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for premeditated murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for the murder of a 16-year-old boy who was found with multiple stab wounds in his body.
The victim, a teenage boy, was found on a raised terrace in the Midsomer Norton area around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he is in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said two teenagers aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested the night before in the Redstock area.
The police have called and contacted anyone who might have any phone records of what happened and what was going on in the past.
As Trump has said, Cavanaugh is fed up with the Democratic Party's rudeness and anger.
"A vote for Kavanaugh is a vote to justify the Democratic Party's gross and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had been receiving influence and anger from the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Before being presented to Congress on Thursday, Cavanaugh denied all the evidence that Christina Blaise Ford had given, on the grounds of violence and emotion.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American people have seen the beauty, the quality and the drive" of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote cast for Kavanaugh is a vote of recognition for one of the greatest civic figures of our time, a justice of the peace with a record of civil service and accomplishments", he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president also spoke eloquently about Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the state of the Republican Party as they face the midterm elections.
"We are just five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I was like I wasn't voting, but actually, it turns out I was", he said.
"That is why, in every seat, I will fight to the end for these worthy candidates".
Trump said the primary mission of the Democrats now is to restrain and resist".
The first procedural vote on Cavanaugh's nomination will be held no later than next Friday in the Senate chamber, a GOP aide said in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died in the earthquake, tsunami and massive tidal surges in Indonesia.
On Saturday, government officials said at least 384 people died in the disaster, many of them hit by huge waves as a powerful tsunami and earthquake simultaneously hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands of people gathered on the beach in Palo on Friday when 18-foot-high waves pounded the coastline, killing countless people and destroying everything in sight.
The tsunami was accompanied by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami first appeared yesterday, people didn't flee immediately and stayed on the coast again and became victims of this disaster", said Indonesian Disaster Management Organization spokesman Supopo Purwo Nugroho at a briefing in Jakarta.
"Not only was there a tsunami, it washed away cars, logs, houses and everything that came along the way", said Nugroho, noting that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h (497 mph) before it hit the coast.
He claimed that he had climbed some trees to save himself, and he was justified in doing so.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated from 24 different centers in Palo.
Documentary footage released by the Emergency Management Agency showed many buildings, shops and bridges that were washed away by the disaster, as well as a mosque surrounded by a large amount of water.
The next event happened in the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Bureau of Procurement and Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released during the disaster was 200 times greater than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city is along the coast, which may have contributed to the increase in damage from the disaster.
Ngroho described the incident as "wide-scale" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found in the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured in the accident, 29 of whom were still being sought.
Ngroho also said that the casualties and damage could have been greater in the northern outskirts of Palo, 300 kilometers (190 miles) from the city, in the area of Donggala, where the epicenter was located.
Communication was "completely limited in terms of information transfer" between the Dongola and other media, said Ngoroho.
There are 300,000 people living in these areas", the Red Cross said, adding that its volunteers and staff were on their way to the scene.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been worse", they said.
On Sunday, the agency came under heavy criticism for providing premature information about the disaster that hit the city of Palo, with authorities saying that the waves had hit another city while the distress letter was still fresh.
In the content shared on social media, you can see a man standing on a rooftop trying to warn the population and get them to vote on the coming waves.
In just a few minutes, a huge wave washed up on the coast, washing away buildings and cars.
The news agencies failed to take the appropriate action in time.
The earthquake and tsunami damaged the power lines between the cities and made it virtually impossible for officials to communicate.
Soldiers from Jakarta and other cities have begun sending first aid planes to the disaster area, but the victims still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for emergencies only and will not resume normal operations until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palo evacuation center on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia is over 800 feet high.
This is really bad.
Mr. Doseba said that as World Vision staff made their way from Dongola to Palo, they had to see some horrific scenes and sites before they reached the special protection areas.
He stated that "they saw many houses destroyed by the disaster".
This is really bad.
Although various local rescue organizations have started their activities and carried out various rescue operations, several similar foreign organizations have been banned from entering the areas of Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, co-financing, aid or support can only enter the country if the disaster area is recognized as an international disaster area and has such status.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a low-level non-alarming disaster", said Awliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares it a national disaster, we can get international help, but we haven't received any reports yet".
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing were still hopeful that there was still a chance for their loved ones to survive, and that the dark trail left by the natural disaster would not remain in their lives forever.
On Sunday, a little boy was pulled from a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been lying under the rubble for two days, next to her mother's body.
Jendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian parachute team, was training two pilots who were lost in the crash to compete in the upcoming Asian Games, scheduled for this month in Indonesia.
The other people in the wreckage of the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced parachutist, I have my emotional limits", he said.
Mr. Gendon described how quickly, in just a few hours, the events at the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the parachutist community. He was desperate to send their messages via WhatsApp to the participants in the Palu festival that was taking place on the beach.
However, there was only one gray dot on her message, not two blue ones.
'I think it means they didn't get the message,' he declared.
Thieves withdrew $26,750 from a bank machine near Newport Beach
According to the Newport Police Department's newsgroup, the thieves were able to steal $26,750 on Friday from a marine who was filling a bank machine at the time.
The driver was cleaning the ATM and making room for even more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a news release.
While the driver was busy with his mission, another "walked up behind the border guard" and snatched him from a suitcase full of money that was to be transported.
Witnesses have identified several suspects involved in the ongoing case, but according to the newspaper, police have not specified the number of people involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the suspects should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The new name of the rapper is Ye
Rapper Ken West changes his name to Ye.
He tweeted on Saturday about the change: "I am formally known as Kenny West".
West, 41, was actually known as Ye for a while, and used that name for his eighth album, which was released in June.
Also, on Sunday's live, we're expecting to see a different visual of Ken, which is where his new album, Yandhi, is expected to be released.
The show's host announced that she would replace Ariana Grande, who declined to perform due to her "emotional background".
In addition to having a current professional name, which is a kind of abbreviation for Ken, West has stated that the word has religious value to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and it means 'you' in the Bible", Ken said in an interview this year when he was discussing the title of his album with host Big Boy on the radio.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
From Kenye, which means only yours, it became Ye, the antonym of our good, bad, mess and all.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sin Combs is known for names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Daddy, but this year he stated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
And the former Western collaborator Jay-Z, he stressed the need for capital letters and decimals in his name.
AMLO of Mexico vows not to use military force against citizens
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to refrain from using military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised the people at a rally in the Plaza de Tlatelolco on Sunday that "we will never use military force to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers attacked civilians, killing 300 leftists. They were representatives of a movement that had roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised monthly subsidies to young people and new public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into the criminal world.
The United States should double its funding for AI.
Kai-Fu Li, an inventor and AI practitioner with experience working at companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double the amount it spends on research.
This commentary came after various parts of the U.S. government filed applications for AI, highlighting the fact that the United States has no formal strategy in place for AI.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it plans to become the number one AI powerhouse by 2030.
"Doubling research funding would be a good start for America, given how far behind other countries are in this regard, and we look forward to more new achievements", Lee said.
Doubling the funding would further increase the chances that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will be in America, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book, "Superintelligence: China, the Silk Road and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China's largest AI-driven organizations.
In the 1980s, he worked on AI systems that beat America's top-ranked players at Carnegie Mellon University, later becoming an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee was sympathetic to the technology competitions that the US government had held so far, such as the robotics competition for defense systems, and he wondered when the next such event would be held to better reflect the prospects for the future.
Lee said that researchers in America often have to do a lot of work to get grants.
"China is not hiring academic leaders; it is hiring corporations", he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies are hiring high-profile university graduates to work with them on AI.
Lee also said that immigration reforms could also help develop artificial intelligence.
"I think you should automatically give green cards to people with PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
Li noted that the China Natural Science Foundation funds academic scientists in educational institutions, similar to government agencies, and that US citizens can receive these funds, but the quality of research is still lower in China.
In the United States, the Department of Defense recently established the United Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is a major collaboration between industry and academia, and the White House has announced that it is preparing to establish an AI committee to select its members.
DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment they're going to make in a project called AI Next.
And the organization that's doing it for NSF, DAPRA, is investing $100 million a year in advancing artificial intelligence.
Yet the U.S. Congress, which has called for a safety committee to develop AI, has not taken any steps this month.
Macedonian citizens to vote in referendum on changing country name
On Sunday, Macedonians took part in a referendum on whether they wanted their country's name to be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict between Macedonia and Greece that has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which occupies the province of Macedonia, has said that Macedonia claims the territory in its name. Greece has therefore vetoed Macedonia's NATO and EU accession process.
Representatives of the two countries agreed to the name change in July, but nationalist opponents say such a move would undermine and undervalue Macedonian Slavic heritage.
The president, Georgy Ivanov, has said he will not participate in the referendum, boycotting it and supporting those who are trying to block the 50 percent barrier.
The referendum ballot asked: "Do you want to join NATO and the European Union through an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price to pay to join the EU and NATO, as Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, to vote for the young people who can live peacefully under the European Union, because it means a safer future for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite not having a legal union, MPs said they would wait for the election results and see if the vote count would be decisive for the country.
It takes more than two-thirds of the vote of the parliament to change the name of the country.
The Election Commission said there was no report of any injuries as of 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent of the population registered at the time, which is significantly lower than the 2016 election, where 34 percent of the population had already registered by then and where 66 percent had finally registered their opinion on the ballot.
"I came here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Jose Tanievski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko have supported a name change for Macedonia, paving the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
At the same time in Skopje, in front of the parliament, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, was setting up a small stage, bringing chairs and lighting them in front of tents for those who were protesting the referendum.
"We want NATO and the European Union, but we want to join these organizations with our heads held high, not at the cost of help from others.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us like Macedonia, we can join Russia and China and become part of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO integration would bring more investment benefits to Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will make this choice because 80 percent of the country supports joining NATO and the European Union", Zaev said in filling out his bulletin.
He stated that a "yes" would be a result that would "determine our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Research Institute showed that 30 to 43 percent of the population would vote in the referendum - which is not enough.
According to a second poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of the population plans to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of those polled said they would vote yes.
It takes 50 percent plus one vote to pass a referendum.
The defeat in the referendum represents one of the biggest failures of the pro-Western government, which came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero manages to maneuver the Brigton defender to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly completed the defensive line for the Brigton players in Sunday's game at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, which ended in a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguero made it a relatively easy task to score for the opponent in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the field.
He passed between three of the Brigton defense players before he was in the open.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green shirts.
He pushed one of the guards before he could outrun the others and was on the edge of a 50-foot line.
After that, he passed the ball to Sterling.
Sterling used the first touch to return the ball to Aguero, who then hit a right-footed shot to the right corner of the net for Matthew Ryan, a Brighton midfielder.
"Aguero is troubled by his foot problems", the club's coach, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
"We were planning on giving him 55, 60 minutes of playing time.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that moment".
But it was Sterling who was able to give the Blues a run for their money in the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball while he was halfway to the Brigton.
He did a great show for Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball several times before he sent it forward in the direction of Sterling.
The blue forward waved the ball several times before he could get it into the opponent's goal.
In the Champions League group stage, City will face Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 am at the Rheine Neckar Arena in Sinchaim, Germany.
Shears wants to play spoiler vs. Rockies
After we were out of the Nationals, it wasn't a big deal to start over.
But, always competitive, Schesser hopes his team can win against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, and only if the Rockies are back in the playoffs, and have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference Baseball Championship.
Friday night, the Rockies were able to pull off a tight 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can put our best foot forward on the field and know that with the atmosphere that the fans created in Denver and the help of the opposing team, we can create the highest level of play that is in the can this year.
Why should you not want to be involved in such a race?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting lineup for the week, but if they do, Shazer will definitely be in the starting lineup.
This will be Schäzer's 34th start, as he came off the bench in Thursday's game, which is why he's pitching in this week's game.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is running a campaign in West Virginia.
The president spoke eloquently about the Supreme Court events surrounding Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the situation the Republican Party has in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will pay off in November.
We're just five weeks away from the most important decision of our lives.
This is one of the biggest, biggest events -- I pretended not to vote, but I did, and that's why I'm trying to fight for these great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump also added, "You see the terrible, terrible groups of Democrats, and you're watching all of this right now.
They're trying to take back power by any means necessary, you see this lack of principle and filth.
They don't care who they hurt, who they turn, they just want power and control, and that's what they want.
He stated that the Democrats' current primary mission is "to restrain and resist".
"And you see that in the last four days", he said, and he responded to the Democrats, "what brazilian, ugly and untrustworthy they are".
He also addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, addressed Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who received a rather loud response from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
You leaked the official documents?
Ah, ah, what?
No, no, no, that was the worst body language -- the worst I've ever seen".
Work will not lose the Church.
He's intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the driving force of my party voted to censor me, I was very surprised.
After all, I'm the last Labour MP they want to reject - and all because I'm speaking my mind.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, deserved a similar response because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censorship movement for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy disagreed with his predecessors on topics like responsible economic policies in government departments, Europe and other issues.
A letter from the East Nottingham meeting said: "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
After eight years as a local MP, Friday night's meeting was just like that for me.
Unfortunately, the tone of the meetings today is not that kind, and the policy of "kindness and courtesy" has been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It's pretty clear that there's a bigotry about different views in the Labour Party, and each view is criticized only on the basis of whether or not it's shared by the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, and as a colleague, he expected me to completely change my mind on a number of issues and take a position that I would never have agreed to in my life -- whether it was on national defense or whether it was on EU unilateral trade.
When I speak in public -- if you want to make this all count -- there's a lot of violence on social media about calling for early elections, dissolving the political center, and calling for me to quit my party.
And this isn't just my experience.
On the contrary, I consider myself lucky that some of the comments that are made about me are political.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and effort of my colleagues who are exposed to sexist and racist slurs every day, but never run away from them.
In today's politics, it's frustrating that this kind of violence has become so normal for us.
Jeremy Crobnin said last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer like the Church, and every "temporary" move or change in the Party's internal structure makes it even more difficult.
Over the past two years, I've had a lot of advice to keep quiet, to keep my voice down, and to just say, "It's going to be okay".
But that's not what I came into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, and this decision was prompted by Thatcher's policies that dismantled the classroom system, I have made it my goal to serve those in the public service who need it most, whether as a local representative or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
There was no way anyone in East Nottingham could have been confused about my political position and the disagreements I had with the then-ruling party.
To those who were in charge of Friday's meeting, the only thing I would like to say, perhaps, is that when your country is heading for a Brexit that could hurt real estate, business and civil service, I don't see why you would want to spend time and energy on such a loyal attitude to the leader of the Labour Party.
But one message I have, not just to the members of the Nottingham Movement, but to my colleagues, to Labour and others: I am proud to have the opportunity to serve you, and I promise you that no threat or bad political will will stop me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.

Eyre 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Eyre tops the table
The last two games could have had some impact on the outcome, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumphant win that this team has achieved in the Tenerife Premiership with today's game.
They're currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top 10.
In the end, it was their good defense and their chances that allowed the team to dominate at home, which is why coach Peter Marsh was happy.
"We have tested our chances in every game, and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christian of Melrose said: "Respect to Eyre, they took their chances better than us".
In the 14th minute, a try from Grant Anderson, designed by Fraser Clemm, took the Ayr team forward, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Horry Hugh gave the Warriors a wide berth and allowed Melrose and Jason Begot to take chances.
After that, Klimos was able to increase the lead of Ayr by a penalty, just before the end of the first half, and make the score 17-5.
Melrose started the second half pretty good, which is why, with Patrick Anderson's effort and Bagot's finish, they were able to cut the lead to five points.
This was followed by a serious injury to Ruard Knott, which forced him to retire from the field, but Eyre was able to cut again and, with the help of McDowall, Climate made the switch.
Aire's active captain Blair McPherson was given a yellow card again, prompting Melrose to make a failed turnaround attempt with a big push on the players.
The home team was able to close out the game, and when Strane Hutchison earned a yellow card for hitting Climate, McPherson was able to score a touchdown and take it to Air Moul.
Climo was able to turn the ball over, and he did it every time, every time, after Kyle Roe sent a box-kick to David Armstrong to Gregor Hanris in the fifth inning at home.

'The sea is ours': Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will clear a path to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the Rising-Clad Command post in La Paz.
The dark blue flag is flown at public facilities.
Marine bases from Tikitaka to the Amazon carry the following slogan: "By law, the sea is ours.
And it is our duty to bring it back".
Bolivia's lockdown is due to the 19th Cuban War, which ended in bloodshed with Chile, a conflict that still grieves the Pacific.
After five years of negotiations, Bolivia is eagerly awaiting the International Court of Justice's ruling, which is due on October 1.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the sense of unity and the sanctity, and of course it wants an affirmative response", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to be on live television to see the international trial, and of course most of them believe that after decades, Chile will be forced to negotiate with the country and make concessions to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president - who is seeking re-election next year - also has his say on Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific", he said last August.
But some analysts think the chances of a decision in favor of Bolivia are very low, and even if it were right, it would not change much.
A United Nations office based in the Netherlands has no influence on Chilean territory, and has said that their involvement will have no effect on these negotiations.
The International Court of Justice has said that the verdict will be handed down in a final hearing in six months, meaning that the case was not "expedited", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the improvement in Bolivia's case, maybe even the last four years, has been backwards.
"The issue of the return of the sea access has been taken up by the Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
The Bolivian military spirit may erode the last of Chile's goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to continue after this.
The two countries haven't sent ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former Bolivian president and country's representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodriguez Valtese, rejected the idea that the trial was unusually swift.
Monday will give Bolivia a chance to "re-evaluate new opportunities for a new relationship with Chile" and give it a chance "to resolve a 139-year dispute to the satisfaction of both sides", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the conflict as a political leverage.
"Bolivia will never give up the opportunity to have access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The return of the wanderer is our chance to prove that we have come out of the past".
North Korea has said that the process of denuclearization will not begin until they trust America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said they would never get a nuclear weapon unless they trusted Washington.
Ri made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made at the Singapore summit between the two rival countries.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of resuming talks with Kim Jong Un that began three months ago in Singapore.
Ri says that the US sanctions and the declaration of an end to the war with Korea are "an empty dream" to drive North Korea away.
Washington plans to agree to the declaration before Fenian takes the first step toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
On the other hand, there is a widespread skepticism that Fenian is seriously considering giving up his weapons, as he sees it as the only way to peace.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show showcased the latest collection of mass-market headwear that may cover your streets.
If you want to increase the size of your helmet, or if you want to protect your body from the sun completely, you're not going far.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a huge and bizarre set of hats for their SS19 collection, which brought the Parisian style to the forefront of the current fashion week.
Extremely uncomfortable skirts have taken over the Instagram world this summer, and designers are once again watching the trend from afar.
The demo version was made by Valentino, and the details included looked like a massive bubble that completely covered the models' heads.
Among other giant accessories were a cut-out coat, a witch's hat, and a pineapple - but their primary purpose is not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also released his weird mascara collection just as Halloween was coming to a close.
Most of them are completely covered in a cannibalistic lector rather than a fashionista.
One creature was wearing a monkey suit, with its swimming glasses and ribbons, while the other was shaped like a frozen ice cube.
And if you continue to go with the trend of the big stuff -- you're in luck.
Stylists suggest that the huge bonnets may even cover the streets nearest you.
The huge hat collection includes La Bomba high heels, which have a two-foot topline and have been seen on people like Rihanna and Emily Ratajakowski.
The iconic creation in the form of the giant hat, which completely embraced social media, laid the groundwork for a new creation on the podium -- a long beach bag that is as big as the model who wears it.
The dark orange raffia bag, stuffed with raffia caps and bearing a white leather nameplate, is part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection from Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity face stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I predict that big shirts and beach bags will hit the streets next summer - because the designer has been so influential, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand.
John Edwards: "Foreign language proficiency is an important skill for global citizens"
The Independent Schools Association of Scotland monitors academic performance, and they will continue to do so in 2018, focusing on good academic attendance, which has been increasing in recent years in sport, the arts, music and other community sectors.
The Schools of Scotland Independent Schools Council (SCIS) represents 30,000 students, and they are committed to providing the highest quality of services to students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for higher education, for the careers of their choice, and to be global citizens.
As an education sector that can design the right curriculum for schools, we see foreign languages as the most popular and in-demand subject to be chosen in schools in the future.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language that they understand, it reflects directly on their mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes straight to his heart".
It's a reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we try to build relationships and trust with people from different countries.
Among independent schools, it is clear from the results of the exams of the past years that foreign languages have the highest marks and rankings in the test.
68 percent of foreign language students earned the highest A's.
According to data from 74 SCIS partner schools, 72 percent of students scored highest in Chinese, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also scored highest.
This is another indication that independent schools in Scotland support the development of foreign languages as a key skill for the future of children.
Languages are now receiving as much attention as STEM subjects in private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey of British job applicants found that 17 percent were reluctant to apply because of the language barrier.
Therefore, more and more attention is being paid to foreign languages to prepare young people for future careers.
In a globalized world, as the number of jobs with multiple languages increases, so does the demand for these skills.
Regardless of career choice, if someone learns a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having a skill that is always useful.
Communicating with a person of another nationality in his native language will always advance you in terms of employment.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 British teenagers in 2013, 75 percent could not communicate in any other language, and 15 percent could only conduct a simple conversation in French.
And now that language learning is so important to our children, that's why we're investing in it.
Knowing several languages, especially in developing economies, equips children with skills that will be important for their employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of language classes.
Part of the schools will focus on the popular classical languages, while the other part will focus on the languages that will be important for the UK in 2020, and those languages are Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a language that interests him and that he can learn from experienced staff and specialists.
The Scottish Independent Schools Association is committed to creating a desirable learning environment for children and equipping them with all the skills they need for the future.
No one can deny that foreign languages play a huge role in the economic development of a country, and that should be extended to education.
Moreover, foreign languages should be considered as "a skill necessary for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer students choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward, headmaster of the Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron makes his Lakers debut in San Diego.
Fans are eager to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that LeBron will play the Denver Nuggets in a preseason game Sunday in San Diego.
But if he plays for a few minutes, it's still unknown.
"The number of game times will be greater than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited time.
At practice last week, James was asked about his plans for the preseason.
"I don't need pre-season games to train at this point in my career", he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign series today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, and the next on the list are places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The letter to the Supreme Court confirms that Trump is going to build support for the midterm elections because Republicans risk losing control of Congress in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia meeting and how can we watch it online?
Trump's meeting with West Virginia's Virginia City Council is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the live stream of Trump's speech at the YouTube channel link below.
At the most likely meeting, Trump will represent Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been embroiled in a sexual assault controversy over the past few days that the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of these meetings is to get some confidence in the November election.
Accordingly, the Trump campaign office said the next five meetings will be aimed at "building up the fun and support as Republicans seek to protect majorities and further strengthen them in the Senate and House", Reuters reported.
"Controlling Congress is paramount as the president plans to visit as many states as possible during the busy campaign", said a Trump campaign spokesman who denied calling himself Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the match, which will be held at West Bank Stadium in Willing, could draw supporters "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and it will be covered by the Pittsburgh media".
Last month, on another Saturday, Trump made his second visit to West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is seeking to support Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey of West Virginia, whose results have been mixed in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey when the president goes to him to get support", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA hopefully prepares for Sunday's individual competition
After three singles seasons, a four-way tie for first place on Saturday night may be just what the Ryder Cup has been waiting for.
The variability of momentum and luck is a completely fabricated pattern in sports, but athletes still hope for it, especially in a competition like the Ryder Cup.
What do they say now, where's their momentum?
"We had a six-figure advantage, now we have a four-figure advantage, so we consider this a small boost", said Jordan Spit as he left for his destination today.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, you have four extra points and a chance to score another 12 points.
Americans, Spit says, feel they have very little fear because they have a very high motivation for the game, as evidenced by the level of play of Spit and Justin Thomas, who trained together and scored three points out of four.
Spit was a disappointment all over the field, and that's why he's leading.
The celebration of the stream became even louder after the round, as Thomas and Spit had scored two doubles.
His 15th-place win was followed by similar calls, which meant the Americans were not going to be out of the championship.
"The only thing I can do is focus and worry about my game", Spit said.
That's what each player has left at this point.
18 more to go.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, rival story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe doesn't have much of a lead, but this great pair has lost four of their last four and they can't be stopped.
Mollywood is the only place they didn't throw a bogey on a Saturday night, they did a bogey on a Saturday morning, Friday night and Friday morning at 9:00.
Judging by the match, and the energy that both players have, it's obvious that the spectators don't find it funny that neither player can cover the European victory and the sun will necessarily set on Le Golf National or Molinari.
Maybe both, but on different screens.
But it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Wimpson did a little work on Sergio Garcia, the morning four-legged hero who got engaged to Alex Noren.
Bogey and two double points won by the Spaniard and lost by the Swedes and never have they been this close to taking the lead.
But on Sunday, there's no one who can help you climb out of your back.
Four-way and pair-playing games are very interesting to watch, because you're watching the relationship between the couples, the advice they give each other and the strategy that might change in an instant.
Europe played a better game as a team and had a significant advantage for the final day, but the American team also showed that they have the potential to be a contender and they are not going to stand aside, so it's still questionable.
For the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads 10-6
Europe will have a big lead on the final day after they beat the United States in Sunday's game and won 10-6.
The Tom Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari duo have won over Tiger Woods, who was barely trying to get a pair at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bion, from Europe, doubts he can reclaim the trophy he won two years ago as Europe dominated the United States in the morning matchup and won 3-1.
The United States needs even more resilience, and despite two victories, they can't get to the finish line.
Jim Farr's team needs eight points from 12 games this week to win the Cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win the Four Continents since he and Molinari won a sensational victory at Mollywood and came close to a sensational Ryder Cup victory.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed, their main target is American rookie Bryson DeCembalo, who is also down 5 and 4.
Despite an outstanding performance on Saturday, Woods has lost 19 of his 29 games, including seven straight.
Justin Rousey is the opening act for the morning foursome, representing partner Henrik Stenson, with whom 2&1 lost to Dustin Johnson and Brooke Koepka in a tie for the world number one and number three.
In the dry southwest of Paris, Europe certainly didn't have easy games.
Three-time champions Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas have set a two-point line after Sunday's game against the Americans.
They won 2&1 against Spain's John Ram and Ian Poulter in a penalty shootout and then came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIllar 4&3 where the opponents lost the first two halves.
Only twice in history have the Furies been knocked out in the quarterfinals, and it's also worth noting that the Furies only need to tie the score to win.
After two days of being top of the line, you're more than welcome to counter-attack this week.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm "under any circumstances" without gaining confidence
Speaking at the United Nations, North Korea's foreign minister said the sanctions would further distrust the United States and that it would not denuclearize.
Ri Yong Ho told the World General Assembly that China had taken "benevolent steps" in the past few years to halt nuclear and military weapons testing, further study them, and pledge not to further spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see a response or action from the United States", he said.
"Without the trust of the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security, and under such conditions we will not be the first to disarm our country".
When Ri was making a statement about what they would have to do in the current phase of the US, his statement seemed to clearly reflect the act of not completely denying unilateral disarmament, an action that Fuhren did two years ago.
Kim also noted the agreements and shortcomings of Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump's June 12 summit in Singapore, where Kim promised Trump to "work on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" when Trump promised him North Korean security.
North Korea is on track to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that the nuclear weapons of Pyongyang should be first to be dropped.
Washington also refrained from talking about lifting sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States demands that Korea 'disarm first' and increase pressure in the form of sanctions to achieve this goal, and also relies on the 'Declaration on the End of War,'" Reem said.
"The idea that sanctions can enslave us is just a dream for those who have no idea about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions in place are only fueling our mistrust.
Rhee did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader outlined at the United Nations this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings he had with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the weapons issue had been resolved with South Korea instead of the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so difficult".
Yet the tone of his speech was markedly different from what he had at the United Nations last year. The General Assembly, which was intended to be a U.S.-North Korea meeting, became irreplaceable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
At a joint summit this year, Trump, who last year promised total destruction of Kim and North Korea, shook the North Korean leader, but said there was more to do and sanctions would remain in place until Korea began the process of disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time to do it, "whether it takes two years, three years, five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the bold move.
Meanwhile, the United States Secretary of State told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must continue to implement the orders given unitedly, without any failures, to finally confirm disarmament".
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to limit and reduce funding for Pyongyang in the nuclear and firearms development aspects.
Pompeo met Rice at a UN meeting and announced that he would be coming to Pyongyang next month for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last meeting didn't go so well.
He left Pyongyang in July, stating that only North Korea had made progress in shaping its "gangster demands".
North Korea has vowed to review its disarmament process this month and "take appropriate measures".
Ri stated that Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he sought were the security guarantees Trump promised him in Singapore, where he promised to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students took a course on getting enough rest.
Harvard University has launched a special course for all students focused on teaching students to get enough rest at a time when the trend of night terrors and caffeine addiction is becoming more common among younger generations.
What academics have found is that students who go to the number one university don't even know how to manage themselves.
Charles Zisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created this course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to start a course like this after learning about the impact of sleep disorders on learning.
'After one meeting, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
The course, which began in the fall of this year, is designed to teach students about the impact of good sleep habits on academic and athletic performance, as well as overall health.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Health Services, said the university decided to introduce a similar course after seeing how many children had trouble sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a set of interactive assignments.
One section of the image shows images of various items such as coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and tells about the effects of caffeine and sunlight, and how they affect athletic performance and the importance of having a good sleep routine.
In another section, participants are asked how much risk they have of heart attack, cancer, and depression if they have a sleep disorder.
The map on campus, with its signs, gives students a stimulus to think about their daily routine.
'We know that this will not change the behavior of students overnight.'
But we believe they have a right to know - just as they have a right to know about the consequences of smoking,' said Professor Zissler.
The culture of 'night-time sleepwalking' persists, he said, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students are contributing to the problem of sleep disorders.
Well, getting quality sleep should be a student's secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue, and irritability - and to prevent obesity, because lack of sleep makes our bodies hungry and makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Sizler to develop the course after Shaw had taken a class with him last year as a freshman.
He said the course opened his eyes and motivated him to take a course in broad concepts.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduates to take a similar course before they re-enter the learning environment.
Professor Sizler advises students to set an alarm clock before going to bed and before waking up, and he suggests students avoid the blue light reflected by electric screens and LED lights, which can significantly alter heart rhythms, causing disrupted sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mango's goal defeats Gerard's boys
Rangers suffered another defeat at home after a goal by Dolly Minga defeated Steven Gerrard's side 1-0.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone last February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard and he suffered his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind Ledbrook in the Premier League leaders' poll.
Menga hit the ball seven minutes into the first half and broke the Rangers' line, which had previously been at a low level of call.
While Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston are third, just one goal behind Hibernian.
And on top of that, the Rangers may have an additional problem after their starting quarterback Calum Spencer sustained a head injury from an off-the-field bullet.
Gerard made eight substitutions during the game in the side that beat Ayr in the quarter-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, is coming off the same 11-point game that got him the points last week, and he's grateful for the way his players' form is reacting in each game.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston did more with that ball than they did.
The Rangers were supposed to be out two minutes before Menga could get the ball to Scott Pittman on the first pitch, but Rangers' attack was blocked by the opposing midfielder.
A penalty kick from Keegan Jacobs reached skipper Craig but defender Alan Lithgow was able to send the ball back.
The Rangers were able to get the ball back, but in the end they seemed more confident than hopeful.
Alfredo Morelos believed he was given a chance to score a penalty after he hit Steven Lawless, but the referee rejected the request with a flag.
The Rangers barely managed to score two runs in the first half, but it was not difficult for the opposing team's goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, to get the balls passed by Lasana and Ovie Edgarian.
At that point, Livingston's key shot in the 34th minute might have been decisive, and no one can deny that.
The Rangers were again unable to hold on to Jacobs' deep defense.
Scott Arfield is unmoved as Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Robinson, who bowls and passes the Mango to close out the attack.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent at halftime and the change had some effect on the flank but a block from the defender ruined it.
But Livingston was able to maintain the desired pace and thereby destroy his opponent, using the long passes of Lithgow and Hacklet.
Holt's team could have gained the lead in the final seconds, but McGregor held firm on the court, and did not give up every move Jacobs made until Lithgow called a corner from behind.
Rangers' change, Glenn Middleton also requested a penalty at the end of the game, but the referee refused this too.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and counting down the days... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for measuring and detecting radioactivity, a discovery that laid the foundation for Geiger's theory.
In science, the Geiger effect has since become a popular culture phenomenon, as well as in the 1950 film The Colorado Bell, which features a dialogue between scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What kind of world is this?"
This is a Geiger ring, used to extract radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the reaction of the mineral atoms, which is caused by radioactivity".
Evans: "You said, he's really blowing this second!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine trains the immune system to detect defective cells
A new cancer vaccine trains the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
Detecting cells that have been destroyed by the vaccine is part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient's body and changing them in a laboratory.
And then they can find the proteins that are specific to many types of cancer and then re-inject them.
The trial vaccine has shown satisfactory results in cancer patients.
One woman's ovarian cancer was cured for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells, modifying them in the laboratory to find the HER2 protein that is specific to many cancers, and then re-injecting them.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Maryland, says: "The results show that the vaccine is promising".
"HER2 causes cancers such as breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancer to grow", he says.
A similar approach to immune cells is being used to treat leukemia.
Kenny West began his pro-Trump appeal by wearing a hat on Saturday Night Live that read, "Make America Great Again".
This all went wrong.
Kanye West's performance on the show caused outrage, and he played US President Donald Trump and said he would run again in 2020.
During the third song, "Ghost Town", she was given a hat with the words, "Make America Great Again". Her emotional speech was directed against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"As often as I talk to white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump when he's a racist?'"
West said, "If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
"Saturday Night Live" began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon criticized Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, accusing Kavanaugh of sexual harassment by Christine Ford.
Although West's speech was not televised, it was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if he was trying to make a joke out of this post for Rocky West.
West was also concerned that he would have problems with the hat offstage.
"They were taunting me backstage.
They said, "Don't go on stage in that town.
They've got me!
And then they said I was a dick", reports the Washington Examiner of West.
West continues, "I would wear a Superman belt because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments caused outrage among the audience and the cast on at least two occasions. One person told Variety: "There was a military silence in the entire studio".
West was brought on as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with her performance of "I Love You" in a Perrier bottle costume.
West was supported by the head of the conservative NGO TPUSA, Candy Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: Thank you for standing up to the mob".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's great".
"But I will not reward anyone (by selling their music or supporting their 'creation') who promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are free too", he added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his formal name to YE.
He is not the first artist to change his name, as did Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion. The music legend Prince, who changed his name to "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince", is also notable.
The attackers were killed in a nightclub in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to the police report, the incident took place in Ballyhakamore.
The accused will appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The DA's office will review the charges.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Harrington speaks about "toxic masculinity"
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor talks about the stereotype of the hero macho. He believes that seeing such roles on screen makes guys believe that if they are cool, they will get respect from others.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Keith notes that "something is wrong" and wonders how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married 31-year-old "Game of Thrones" star Rose Leslie, admits that he feels strongly about facing up to this challenge.
"I now feel strongly about where we went wrong with masculinity", he says.
"What did we teach the boys when they were growing up? That's why we see these problems now".
Keith believes that the presence of male characters on television contributes to this problem.
He goes on to say, "What is natural and what are the lessons?
Does what is being taught on the streets and on television force boys to take the side of what is called being a man?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is, how can we change this?
Because obviously, something's not right for young men".
In an interview, he admitted that he would not be touching the prequel and sequel to Game of Thrones when the final series was released next summer. He says that he "was left with the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a film producer and his thieving brother.
The actor recently said the best thing about being on "Game of Thrones" was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on that show, so I actually started a family on that show.
Rose plays the role of Ighrit who falls in love with Keith's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health ministry officials say.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of them were passed on through sex, which is different from past experiences.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in different parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected has been brought to almost zero, Chinese health ministry officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people continues there.
Studies show that because of the country's conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
The disease is transmitted through the use of inappropriate protective measures during sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make AIDS treatment accessible to all to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaks of Republican Senate data by staff members, calling them "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denies allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff leaked the personal information of three Republican senators and posted it on Wikipedia pages.
He argued that the charges were driven by far-right experts and sites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
The personal information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senators Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was leaked online by an unidentified source on Thursday as a Senate panel hearing was underway on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState say the email was uploaded from an IP address associated with Waters' office.
"This is a baseless accusation, it is false and utterly false", Waters continues.
"My staff member is not responsible for any of this leaking, and we have made a commitment to their identity, privacy and security.
"This is a baseless accusation, it is false and utterly false".
Waters's claim was quickly followed by criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"He angrily denies it", writes Fleischer.
"This fact tells us that Waters does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't get angry.
A person does not become a Jew.
People don't ask questions about the motives of the accused.
It keeps you calm and untroubled".
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
"Great if it's true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the relevant agencies and law enforcement authorities to this fraud".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified", he continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English's new hit review - a weak parody of the spy by Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition to look for meaning in any new British-themed film, and it seems to be the case with this new version of the John English action-comedy parody franchise - which started back in 2003 with John English and was revived in 2011 with the film adaptation of John English.
Ironic self-satire should be our nation's new export opportunity on the subject of how obviously trash we are?
In any case, the license of the rubber-faced, blindfolded, incompetent Johnny English has been renewed for a second time to blow it all up - he's the name that more than anything else sends a signal that he's a broad comic creature designed for non-English-speaking film-loving territories.
Of course, he's a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of mild glamour, has the qualities of a bit of a clown, the strings of Mr. Bean, and the qualities of a grown-up with the glove that contributes a single note to the chariot of fire motif at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the traveller and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial that caused chaos on its way.
There's a good moment or two in this last part of John English.
I loved it when John in the English Middle Ages dressed up as a man approached the helicopter and the rotor mouths were squeaking down his face.
Atkinson's physical comedy flair is on display, but the humor seems a little weakened and strangely over-used, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible themselves confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
It feels like humor is meant for kids, not adults, and to me, the silly tragedies of Johnny English are not as creative and focused as the jokes of Atkinson's Mr. Bean movies.
The message that is constantly being sent these days is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker hacked into a top-secret British spy website, revealing the identities of every British field agent, much to the dismay of other agents -- a small role for Kevin Eldon, unfortunately.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and combative figure who is already suffering a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best for this quasi-Theresa May character, but there is not much to work with in the script.
His intelligence advisors tell him that since every spy is compromised, he needs to get someone out of retirement.
That means making a fool of John English himself, currently working as a teacher at some prestigious institution, but teaching informally how to become a secret spy: Here's some good jokes when the school in England offers a rock-style spy academy.
In England, he was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering comrade Buff, again played by Ben Miller.
Buffy is now a married man, married to a submarine captain, a hilarious hockey green where Vicky Pepperdine is a little bit missing.
So, as the evil Batman and Robin, both of His Majesty's Secret Service, re-emerge, they suddenly meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful lady of destiny, Ofelia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer challenge: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
Inglis and Buffy begin their odyssey with Persian high hopes: as delivery drivers, they set fire to an expensive French restaurant; they create chaos and steal into Volta's expensive yacht; and Inglis causes pure anarchy as she tries to use a virtual reality device to get a good look inside Volta's house.
All the stops, of course, are taken in that last order, but as well-organized and energetic as it is, there are very few children's TVs for that.
It's pretty mediocre.
And as with other John English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that was truly worthy of her talent?
Labour refuses to develop a plan for the British to work four days a week and get paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to make the British work four days a week - but get paid five.
The party is reportedly seeking a donation from the company's executives to the savings made by the AI revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This will allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.
Sources say the idea was "in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to redistribute the country for the benefit of workers".
The shift to a four-day week is already being embraced by unions as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year".
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that is consistent with the Party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party isn't the first to come up with this idea, the Green Party campaigned for a four-day workweek in the 2017 general election.
The ambition is not currently fully endorsed by the Labour Party, though.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not being discussed by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to make clear his vision for a socialist economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to trade power for "unknown directors" and "speculators" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also suggest that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to fully recover their interests, as the Labour government may be able to "dismiss" them on the basis of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed a plan to put employees on company boards and create ownership funds to give 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees, equivalent to an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy, they're asking 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh will change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI's findings will force Republican senators to back him.
In an interview on this week's "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could come up with something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the hearing, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the accusation was made, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was tough, he was tough, he was tough".
However, Graham's voice seems to be unstable.
"My mind is completely occupied with Brett Kavanaugh, and it's going to be a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
"And whoever names it, no one can prove it.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see any new change".
What is Global Citizen's Day, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizen's Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive cast of star performers and an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather on the Great Central Park lawn to not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to raise awareness about the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "activities" such as volunteering, writing a letter to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other important way to raise awareness about the event's real purpose, which is to end poverty.
But just how successful is the Global Citizen Festival, 12 years ahead of its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a true way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called collectivism - when people think they're making a real difference by signing an online petition, or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has recorded over 19 million "activities" from its supporters, pushing hosts to different goals.
He reports that these activities have helped to inspire world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided have so far directly impacted more than 649 million people worldwide.
Some of these commitments are the power of food, a UK-based partnership of investors and performers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country's food shortage after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of food insecurity behind us", Food Force Ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would fund the project, Food Force, which will reach 5 million women and children by feeding them.
It's a response to one of the most frequently asked questions on our website, which is, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied, "It's going to be a long and difficult road -- sometimes we're going to fail and we're going to fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Moné are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York City, which is being led by Deborah-Lee Furness Hugh Jackman.
US Navy may use blockade force to block Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
"If necessary", Washington can deploy its navy to disrupt Russian energy, hit markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by The Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade in energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And, according to official data, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blockade them to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke addressed the event, which was hosted by the Consumers Energy Association, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran's approach, and he noted that they're basically the same.
"The economic option with Russia and Iran is more or less to use and replace the fuel as a barrel", he said, referring to Russia as "one-speciality" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
Reports are that the Trump administration is aiming to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to convince Germany to reject the "unreasonable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "spoon" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in Moscow after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The US position caused dissatisfaction in Germany, which confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to abandon EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "seriously considering" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
In the town hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering joining.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes having a woman in the lead", she said, Hill quoted.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren challenged President Donald Trump during his time in office, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was candid in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, we need a Federal Bureau investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think he should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 88 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not vote.
Twenty-two percent support running for this office.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of the potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other more prominent names in the Democratic Party are considering a possible 2020 vote for Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he will make a formal decision in January, The Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin quotes Trey Palin about his PTSD at the Donald Trump rally.
Trac Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through on his return, I connect it to other families who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries that our soldiers have come back with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a blindness to an obvious problem", and said of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little changed, they come back a little shaken, they come back wondering if they get the respect that their fellow soldiers and pilots and other service members gave for their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, who was cited for domestic violence and carrying a weapon while distracted.
18 states, the District of Columbia, support new asylum laws
Thirteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that does not provide shelter for victims of gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a court-friendly summary to support asylum seekers, prompting politics, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case against Grace Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been released.
She said she was abused by her partner "and his violent gang member's children", but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State officials who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing large numbers of asylum seekers to the United States as these nations face acute problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence and seek asylum.
District of Columbia Commissioner General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be based on specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and this restriction violates that principle", the judge said.
The delegates then argued that the policy of barring immigrants from entering the country undermines U.S. policy, saying they are becoming more entrepreneurial and "providing us with the labor force we need".
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges in June to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who have left their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said on June 11, when announcing the policy.
Sanctuary has never been a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
The volunteer rescue effort in Palu, where the death toll has doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's a lot of pressure", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her feverish child at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is not enough".
People are returning to their destroyed homes, scavenging for submerged property, trying to salvage anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were hit by the 7.5-magnitude quake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwayne Harris, who has a fractured hip and shoulder, were resting outside the Palouse Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for prolonged severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he began to cry out again about his feelings when a violent earthquake hit the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"It wasn't time to get out of our way.
I think I followed the wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I learned how my husband would ask for silence, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my son.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'propaganda advertising' and 'violence'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in which the US daily called for a total ban on US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump addressed the Chinese Daily's price supplement to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - on Wednesday after China was accused of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election, which US officials told Reuters was clear, was the latest phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war, where they are increasing tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which backs Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural commodities to China, says Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register on Monday that China "is now doubling down on this violence by spreading propaganda in our free press".
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
"In contrast, here in Beijing, on a newspaper cover along the street, you will find limited dissent and no real dissent that the Chinese people can have about the trajectory of China's troubled economy, showing that the media is under the heavy grip of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
With Kavanaugh's defeat, Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the primary, analysts warn.
While senior Republicans are on standby to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned they will face a negative outcome in the midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotion surrounding this was extremely high, and most Republicans have already registered to vote and feel they want to push ahead with the vote.
There is no going back on that", Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Rieher said he suspected that a last-minute push by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI investigate would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Washington Post on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a demonstration in the Senate chamber as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be at a very high level", said Steve Rosenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say it's high already; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and among young voters, ages 18 to 29, who, while they dislike the president, often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony that outlines his sexual assault allegations against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts are predicting a negative outcome if the Republicans go forward with the evidence.
"This has become a stupid mess for Republicans", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, or the final vote, or whether they put Kavanaugh in the chair, it's also about how the Republicans approached it and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that promotes the Democratic primary, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and a little more supportive of the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents either definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said Kawano was likely or unlikely to have been drunk in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford, as well as the allegations made by at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh drugged and raped her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee showed her a genital organ when they were at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a new project to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people have access to to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention is "world domination".
"We have to do this now", he said at the launch.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store", or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in one browser at the same time.
What's unique about online repositories of personal data is that it's entirely up to the user to decide who gets access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "direct authority through data".
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to commit resources, processes and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted staff developers, and a volunteer coders' union.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized apps using tools posted on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether they would introduce a complete change where all their business models completely collapse in one day.
"We don't ask them for their permission".
In an article published on Medium on Wednesday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the newly created grid on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he formed the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Commemorated by the receipt of the Victoria Cross by a clergyman in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross for fighting in World War I was commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 during the assault on Bellingly and Lecour.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
On Sunday, in a parade, his two grandchildren erected a memorial stone in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was erected exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion along the St. Cant's Canal "despite a very heavy hail and under heavy artillery and shelling fire".
Then he drove up to the line of fire and "very bravely" led the line forward to the artillery and shot three of them.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, exactly one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I couldn't do, but something that was humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, were also crowned after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feels very honored to be part of the parade", adding that "the courage of a true hero is seen in the support that comes from many people".
Mixed martial arts fans spent the night watching Bellator 206 instead of choosing Peppa the dog.
Imagine spending all day trying to get into Bellator 206 and not being able to see the main event.
San Jose's account included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, after Gerard Moussa and Rory McDonald had prepared to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the broadcaster turned on the dog on the paper.
Some desperate after they've spent the whole night on this one.
One fan tweeted about the baby cartoon as "a sick joke".
"It's state policy that at 6 a.m. this show was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", said David Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the show.
"Flower of the goose, yes".
Bellator president Scott Coker said they were working on their schedule to accommodate UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we might think of something", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning there on Sunday, and we can't work on it until Sunday in our time, and Monday in their time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when it changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and none of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't. It was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're going to have five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to show more to the fans and we just got a little too much.
This is a sad situation".
Tom Daley was feeling "compromised" about his sexual orientation.
Olympic archer Tom Dale says he grew up feeling discriminated against because of his sexual orientation - but that it motivated him to succeed.
She says that she didn't realize it until she went to high school, where "not everyone is like me".
For the first time, on Desert Island Discs, a talk on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to "give hope" to others.
She also stated that since becoming a parent, she is less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular host, Kirsty Young, was sidelined for several months due to illness.
Appearing in a cameo on Laverne's first program, Daley stated that as she grew up, she felt "less than" others because she was "not socially accepted when both boys and girls liked you".
He said, "Today, the feelings of inferiority and difference that I felt were real, and they gave me strength, they gave me success".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", she said, so that she wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about her sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT campaigner and used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to draw more countries to protest discrimination against homosexuality.
He said he took the vote because he was lucky enough to live without openly ramming and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said she fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "He caught me by surprise".
Dale married Oscar, who is 20 years older than her, last year, but she said that age difference was never an issue.
"When I'm this old", he said -- he competed in his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find anyone his age who had experienced the same uplift and misfortune.
The couple became parents to a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale says his "total values" have changed.
"If you ask me last year, all I wanted to do was win gold", he said.
"You know, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My gold medal is Robbie".
Her son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father couldn't accept the fact that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be in the front row, Dad,'" she said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he really stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't immortal", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to perform in front of my fans at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", she said.
This also inspired her to choose her first song, Proud by Heather Small, which resonated with her during her Olympic trials and still resonates today.

A disqualified Michelsson was named to the Ryder Cup roster on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to get back in shape before it becomes a misfortune for him.
Mickelson, who will be making his 12th appearance in the two-year-old event, was entered by captain Jim Furyk in the Sunday Foosball and Forsam.
Instead of being the center of the action, as she often was in the United States, the five-time major winner divided her day between being a cheerleader and working on her game in the hope that something would fix what was hurting her.
Never, ever, has the most accurate driver, even at the peak of his career, at 48 years old, been perfectly suited to Le Golf National, a long and rough penalty for constantly making a wrong shot.
And if the course itself isn't tough enough, Michelson, in Sunday's ninth match, will take on defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is vying with rookie Tom Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down, start 12 singles games off on a hot start, the Michelsons match will be absolutely important.
Furyk had expressed confidence in her husband, not that she could tell him much.
"Man fully understood the role I was playing today, and he put his hand on my ring, shook my hand, and told me he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"She's very confident.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's made a lot of great contributions to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn't have known he was playing two games.
I was more determined, but this is how it worked, and this is the way we thought we should go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
On Sunday, Michelson will beat Nick Faldo, who holds the record for most Ryder Cup games.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the heights of his individual records.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time wins, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought some untouchable emotions.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's talkative, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a good guy to have on your team", she explained.
"I think the young players have joined him, as they did this week, which was good to see.
It offers much more than just a game".
Captain Thomas Byrne of Europe knows that a big difference could soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that being a big marginal lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
Dane made his debut in 1997 at the Vandermeer, where the side captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans but came close to the finish line by a narrow margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big difference at Walderama; we had a big difference at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Walderama, where we won, but only", said Bjorn, after the 2018 5-3 win both on Friday and yesterday when they had a 10-6 lead over Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're playing full-time tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to.
It's not complete until you get your marks on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the Cup, and that's what we're focused on.
All this time I've been saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world".
Satisfied with how his players had played in a tense game of golf, Bjorn added: "I couldn't have imagined it.
Tomorrow, another beast is waiting for us.
We're going to have one-on-one presentations tomorrow, and this is different.
It's a great feeling to be standing there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're out there alone, you're going to be checked out completely like a golfer.
That's the message you want to take to your players, show your best tomorrow.
Now, you have your partner behind you, and he has to go out and do his best, too".
Unlike Bjorn, on the other side, Jim Furyk expects his players to play better individually than as a pair, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those big raids the day before, part of what was a winning team in Brooklyn before he was defeated when Europe gave birth to the Miracle of the Medina.
"I remember every swear word out there", he said when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw addressed his players on his final day in 1999.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to get off to a fast start like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this impulse takes one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We put our lineup together and put our guys out there in a way that we felt, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas avoided the challenge to challenge and faced Rory McElroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pulter, with other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I came up with this lineup with this group of guys because I think it covers all the tracks", Björn said when selecting his single.
The German warship's arrival has been delayed once again.
The new frigate was due to be delivered to the German Navy in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be delivered until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reports.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit quotes a military official as saying.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but troubled post-delivery issues complicated the completion of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They'll obviously have a powerful submarine, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some of the STEL technologies, like radar reduction, infrared and acoustic technologies.
Other important features are long storage periods - it should be possible to deploy new frigates away from the home port for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the latest warships - designed to bolster Germany's navy - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The Abed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the German Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its call.
The reason for the withdrawal is not known, but the German media cited a number of major "program and hardware flaws" that would have rendered the warship unfit for combat if it were launched.
The software defect was particularly significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship is manned by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the personal staff of the aging Bremen-class frigate.
It also turned out that the ship was dramatically overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz will be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
Along with the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project - including crew re-training - is another issue.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - up from 2.2 billion euros.
The problems associated with the new frigates are particularly significant in light of the recent warning that the German fleet is declining in strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defense committee, admitted that the fleet was actually "surviving deployment".
The spokesperson said the problem would accumulate over time as older ships were retired but replacements were not.
She complained that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate would join the fleet.
The National Trust is investigating the secret lives of the nightingale
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to understand how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
They hope the findings will shed light on the unique behavior of these flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland tracked common and small bats as well as brown giant bats and downton bats in Inverveys Gardens, West Ross.
Special monitors will be installed at key locations throughout the property to monitor nighttime activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting mobile monitoring using handheld sensors.
Experts analyze all the voice recordings to determine how often the bats call and which species does it.
Then a habitat map and a report is made to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will allow them to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands, how to preserve forested areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their habitat and their habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning are also at risk, as are some chemicals in pulp and paper and building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Night owls are not actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to locate insects and identify obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for protecting more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the nightingale very seriously.
Matt has ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspections, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation also established Scotland's first and only wildlife reserve for the owl, on Treve Land in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten owl species.
Land manager David Thompson says the land is an ideal area for them.
"Here in the Triangle, we have a lot of room for the night", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, lots of good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other lands will help us learn more about what they need to grow".
He stresses the importance of checking the nests before conducting security work on the property, as the accidental destruction of a single brood pouch can kill up to 400 females and young, likely leading to the complete extinction of the local population.
The bats are protected and killing, harassing, or destroying their prey is illegal.
Elizabeth Farrell, an officer with the Scottish Moose Conservation Trust, is calling on the community to help them.
He said, "We have so much to learn about our bats and our species, we just don't know how they live".
Ronaldo is acquitted of rape charges and lawyers are suing the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", stating that people "should cover themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
Speaking to 142 of Tavi's followers in an Instagram live video, just hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, called the allegations "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, this is not a game.
What they said today is fake news", says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
"They want to advertise under my name.
It's not a bad thing.
They want to be known for my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over what they call "unacceptable reporting on suspicions in the private sphere", reports Reuters.
Christian Scherz, a lawyer, said the player was seeking compensation "for moral harm, with a reasonable amount of gravity for the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, based on the information, Ronaldo and the mayor returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her orally, according to the filing in Clark County Court in Nevada.
The mayor claims that after the incident, Ronaldo got down on his knees and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who had exaggerated "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo admits that the couple had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayor also states that he went to the police and showed them pictures of his trauma taken at the hospital, but then agreed to settle the dispute out of court because he felt "fear of retaliation" and was afraid of being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to repair the damage as she is still traumatized from the incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United, accused of assault, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: the UK is losing its car manufacturers.
The UK will lose its position as the world leader in car production, says Business Secretary Greg Clark, after Brexit.
He added that it was significant that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would cause a temporary halt to production at its plant in Burnton, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays would be on Brexit jobs if the deal fails.
The Burnton plant (which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis) produced around 150,000 cars last year, and 90% of them were exported to other EU countries.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a shutdown in our factory", said Toyota's CEO Marvin Cook in Burnton.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without cross-border trade deals, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The key issue that concerns the views of carmakers is the risks to the supply chain if the Brexit deal fails.
Toyota's production line operates on a so-called on-time basis, with spare parts being delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the European Union and the United Kingdom for cars already ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, this could lead to disruptions at the border, causing disruption and parts shortages in industry.
Toyota would be unable to hold inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was precisely designed to avoid such border checks.
"We need to get this deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow us, as I said, to be successful at this stage, and also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Based on the evidence from manufacturers other than Toyota, we absolutely need the ability to continue to run highly successful supply chain initiatives.
Toyota could not comment on the length of the shutdown, but warned that if it continued for too long, it would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately reduce jobs.
Peter Zuvaleris, who has worked at the Burnton site for 24 years and is the head of the union at the plant, says his members are very concerned about this.
The government spokesman said: "We have presented a clear and rational plan for our future relationship with the EU".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed yet again.
According to a White House statement on Sunday, Donald Trump's high-level meetings with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed to next week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kaufman continues.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aid and Russia, and potential misconduct by the president in legislation.
Whether Trump will challenge his own deputy attorney general and threaten Mueller's independence will be a rumour in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, in an interview with the New York Times, Rosenstein said he had considered using a wire to talk to Trump, and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused to accept the report.
Last Monday, he went to the White House, and according to the report, he was planning to resign.
So, the meeting with Trump, which was at the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Wednesday.
Trump said he did not want to disagree with Rosenstein, but has since postponed the meeting to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was hearing testimony from Kavanaugh and one of the ladies, Christine Blaise Ford, about his sexual offenses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against the gang, and then postponed the Senate plenary vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The exact date is not yet set, the note may be scheduled this week, I think the postponement is related to the ongoing issues in the Supreme Court.
But we're going to watch and we're going to report the news.
Several reporters are going to challenge the evidence: Sanders hasn't held a White House briefing since September 10th.
The host was curious about the reason.
Sanders stated that the lack of briefings was not due to the lack of reception of the "action" by the TV reporters, but he also added: "I agree that this "action" is intended to achieve a special effect".
He later said that the direct relationship between Trump and the media would grow.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any of his predecessors", the respondent added, without citing evidence, adding, "We've reviewed the numbers".
Sanders said briefings will continue in the future, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot, and as you can see, a lot of work has been done over the last few weeks, and we're also planning to have briefings where you'll have the opportunity to speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House, or attends open sessions and high-level press conferences.
Special press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president is supposed to demonstrate why the free flow of ideas and the original image are being shown to the assembled reporters.
The Health Secretary wrote to the EU NHS employee in Scotland about Brexit fears.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working at NHS Scotland, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the country and a desire to keep their jobs after Brexit.
MSP Gene Freeman wrote the letter at least six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover claimed compensation for EU citizens who work in devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Negotiations between the EU and the UK have been ongoing all summer, with a decision likely to be reached in the autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand this may be a time of concern for you.
So I want to remind you once again how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and other regions are sharing invaluable experience and knowledge that will strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, and benefit patients and communities in our country.
Scotland is, in fact, your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrum undergoes surgery after sustaining a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christon Abercrum underwent surgery after sustaining an injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player was injured halfway through the game.
And so, when he got to the sideline, this happened, "Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrumb oxygen at the scene before he was moved to the back of the bus and taken for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrum was being prepared for surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harry added that he had no other information about the injury at this time and the state of Tennessee was trying to determine the location of the injury.
Abercrumb, a redshirt athlete, is playing his first season in Tennessee since moving to Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five touchdowns, and he's had 18 total touchdowns this season.
Foreign buyers will be spared higher surcharge when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will avoid higher back taxes when they buy property in the UK with extra cash to be used for vulnerable communities under the new Tory plans
The move would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in the tax rate will be imposed on people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury is planning to increase it to £120 million a year to help homeless citizens.
Theresa May's announcement today will see foreign buyers be required to pay higher back taxes when buying property in the UK with extra cash to help homeless people.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn in attracting younger voters with mortgages to provide more affordable housing and rely on high-income citizens.
The increase in the levy will impose additional cash on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, helping the government's efforts to tackle the problem of homeless citizens.
The sub-tax, which is in addition to the current surcharge, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent, is set at a rate of three percent.
The Treasury is planning to raise it to £120 million a year.
Thirteen percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents, driving up prices and preventing first-time home buyers from entering the sector.
Many affluent neighborhoods in the country, especially in the capital, have become so-called ghost towns, as most of them are bought by foreigners who are not in the country.
The new policy is being developed after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the estate tax to allow young people to buy their first homes.
He accuses the big developers of keeping prices high and underutilized, and urges Mrs. May to abolish quotas on affordable housing.
Mr. Corbyn made a statement on the proposed major reforms to the real estate sector, including the control of renters and the end of unfair advertising.
It also intends to give the consuls (councillors) more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I made a vow that I would devote my entire premiership to the British Dream, and make life better for generations to come.
And that means we're going to respond to our real estate market failures.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it would not be right if we made it easier for people who do not live in the UK or foreign companies to buy property than it is for hardworking UK residents.
For many people, owning a home is still a dream, and a humiliating night outdoors stay is a reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his biggest ambition is to become Scotland's ruler at some point.
Scott, 42, is enjoying a resurgence at the North Eastern club, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points behind the top-flight.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light to manage St Mirren in their final season in the Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B-line, which is what I wanted", Ross told BBC Scotland Sports in an interview.
When I was a kid, I used to go to Scotland with my dad in Hampden, and it kind of takes me back to when I was a kid.
We'll take advantage of this opportunity only if I succeed in running the club.
Ross's predecessors at Sunderland included Dick Lawyer, David Moye, three Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poyet and Paulo DiCanio.
The former Alloa Athletic player further stated that he was not uncomfortable working with such famous faces at a big club, and had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Is my success at this point driven by my desire to bring this club back to the Premier League?
If you look at the structure of this club and the infrastructure, there's no doubt that it belongs in the Premier League", he says.
It's not an easy task, but I think I'm very likely to be a successful manager, my club will be in the Premier League.
Ross began his managerial career three years ago, first as assistant manager at DuBarton and then spending 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to promotion to the Third Division and won the Championship title for St Mirren the following season.
And Ross says he feels better than he did when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He remembers it as a real crossroads.
Well, I really believe that management is the right thing to do, much more than playing.
It's weird, but I feel good, I get a reasonable income, and I've reached certain heights.
But the game is difficult.
You have a lot of challenges to overcome during the week.
I deal with the stress and pressure that is so inherent in my job, but I still think I'm not going to fail in management.
I've always been attracted to management, and I'm into it now.
You can listen to the broadcast interview on Sportsound on Monday, September 30th on Scottish Radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to the study, a Sunday at 5:30 p.m. is a good time to have a pint.
The summer heat has boosted pubs' revenues in Britain, but the storm has burned restaurant chains.
Sales at pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, according to the calculations.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA who conducted the calculation, said: "Continued warm weather and England's surprise World Cup attendance would have caused the same numbers in July as the previous month, when club revenue rose by 28 per cent and restaurants saw bigger losses.
The restaurant sales declined by 1.8 percent in June, and then worsened in July.
Drinking pubs and bars have strengthened their positions as restaurant rates have fallen.
Food bars were hit by the heat, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seemed that the citizens just wanted to drink.
While pub and bar sales rose 6.6 percent in one month, food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a tourism analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the most important factors in terms of domestic sales.
There is no doubt that restaurant groups will continue to struggle as their sales decline by 4.8 percent annually, which is especially painful given the current tax bill.
The long hot summer is not a good time for food vendors, and time will tell if the expected moderate temperatures in August give us a reason to breathe.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand awareness.

One in five children has a secret social account that they keep from their parents.
According to a study, one in five children under the age of 11 has a secret social network account that is hidden from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Instagram profiles.
The news has increased fears that sexual content may be published
Thirty percent of the students surveyed said they had a website for their parents to show them.
One in five children, some as young as 11, have created a social media account that is hidden from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Instagram profiles, including the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news raised fears that sexual content would be published.
Twenty percent of the students said they use a clean source account to show their parents, and they also have their own personal accounts.
One parent took his 13-year-old daughter to a secret website where she offered to rape her.
According to a survey by the Digital Awareness Seminar and the Headmasters of Independent Schools in the UK, 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 use two profiles, and half of them have permission to use personal profiles.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing to see so many teenagers going online that is unknown to their parents and teachers".
Eileen Doyle is to become the Athletes' Spokesperson for the Scottish Strength and Conditioning Council.
Eileen Doyle was elected to the Resilience Council of Scotland as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting governing body.
Doyle is a renowned strength and conditioning coach in Scotland. Ian Beatty described the move as a good opportunity for those who want to benefit from the sport over the last decade at an international level building on his extensive experience.
"She is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the world's strength and conditioning community, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from her appointment to the board", said the Beatles.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be taking on the role of sports reporter and hope to make a major contribution to the development of the sport in Scotland".
The American, who competed in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is a four-time Olympic gold medallist, is now a regular commentator for the BBC, having difficulty moving after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Just a month ago I had a stroke.
I needed a move.
The doctors say that time will tell when and how much I will recover.
With great effort, I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and now lead an active life.
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A chest tube ad comparing a mother to a cow is sharing ideas online
The breast tube company shared its idea with an online ad that compared breastfeeding mothers to fat cows
To celebrate the new launch, said to be "the world's first silent breast tube", consumer technology company Elvie released a music video-style promotional video used to show the freedom the new tube gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dancing in a snow-filled cow's backyard, to a song that includes the words, "Yes, I'm burning the milk myself, but you can't see the milk", and, "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't geese, these are my breasts.
The team goes on, "Amotumbe, Amotumbe, I'm feeding this to the children, Amotumbe, Amotumbe, I'm feeding this to my ladies".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows in the product.
We believe that they must conceive and give birth to produce milk, and that their young are not breastfed for a few days after birth.
Elvie's chest tube is unconsciously twitching in the mammary leaf. - Elvie / mother
Another commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them in a breast tube commercial for people who are having babies?
Someone added, "What an awkward ad".
One woman admits that she found the song "humorous".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I was a mammal.
When I was out, I felt like a real cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it as it was.
This is a brilliant product", writes one.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who smoke milk (often in their workplace or bathroom) and feel like cows".
This is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, you see women dancing with tubes in their pants.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that most women who smoke say they feel like cows.
And Elvie's tube is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and it folds in the leaf unnoticed, allowing women to move around freely, hold their babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, partner and mother of ECD, comments: "Elvie's pipe is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women's self-expression and the cows that are being milked, we wanted to pump milk from the breast and bring all of her problems into focus, demonstrating in a fun and exciting way the unimaginable sense of freedom that the new tube brings.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pipe has made headlines.

The number of migrant children being detained has increased dramatically, but the monthly border crossings have remained relatively stable, in part because the Trump administration has introduced harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been unsubstantiated immigrants who feared they would jeopardize their ability to stay in their country in the process of claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints and their data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied for sponsorship of undocumented minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are criminal residents.
So we will continue to persecute these people", said Mr. Alpens.
To speed up the process, officials introduced new rules that some of the children must be brought to court within a month of their detention, instead of 60 days as was the case with previous standards for asylum workers.
Many will appear via videoconference rather than in person to the immigration judge to announce their legal status.
Anyone who does not submit will be deported immediately.
According to reports from shelter workers and reports that have surfaced from the system over the past few months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Lawyers say these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions like Tornillo, where there are signs that children are more likely to be ignored in their struggles because of their size.
They also said that without giving children enough time to prepare emotionally and to say goodbye to friends, moving them to a tent city could exacerbate the trauma that most are already battling.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw their troops immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called for Syrian refugees to return, despite the war in the country now in its eighth year.
Muallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "treated accordingly".
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the congregation.
Muallem argued that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy battle until it liberates all of Syria" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign entity".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and train both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in war-torn territory.
As for the refugees, Muallem said the conditions for their return were good, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that has forced refugees not to return to their country.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return", he said.
"They're apoliticising what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement to create a buffer zone between Russia and Turkey, the last major rebel force in Idlib, has created an opportunity to resume political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ended a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who "will be wiped out".
UN spokesman Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of the new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, soon to work out a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing the current articles of the constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
What will be, without a doubt, "The most dramatic end of the presidency!"
At this point, there's no sign of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to -1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Meadows Show" topped 3.5 million in cable ratings for its prime-time news night.

Beyond the money, it has grown into a tough House of Revolution by-election.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a cash flow, thanks to a congressional redistricting that has seen two seats in the race for the same seat.
This newly renovated Pittsburgh suburb is surrounded by a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lamb, who won the second round in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against fellow Republican incumbent Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which partially overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were reworked when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January upheld that the old districts had been unconstitutionally created in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th led to a reduction in campaign funding for the party's finance department, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC), and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the general election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
This seat was held by a Republican for a decade, and President Donald Trump beat the county by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States lifted its sanctions on El Salvador for supporting China
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing's minority territory from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama before partners evacuated the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to "the latest decision to deny recognition to Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But the fines were only for El Salvador, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, will be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
In line with the development of local meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being after similar meetings last year as a step forward to prevent migration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively stopped discussing sanctions on El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence will now address a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign the administration is shifting meeting locations.
And three American ambassadors have returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate, which was described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is a book that is full of truth.
The next step could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now in the public record.
Mr. Mueller also reports that his investigation will go beyond whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during our election.
If Congress goes from hand to hand, then Mr. Trump will be held accountable for himself, just as he prepares to speak to his constituents, and ultimately, to a jury of his peers.
That's a lot, and I don't mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable -- as is his European counterparts.
We're all going to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only for the West to resist him and support Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
We lost and missed the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around this kind of inflation, and the unending march of democracy speeds up or delays.
Americans today are at this tipping point.
What do we do if Mr. Trump sacks Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is already in hot water after the newspaper reported that last year he decided to secretly write to the president and talk about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
"How are we supposed to respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavalo is not complete or fair - or if it has been upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and insincere evidence?
And first, will there be a moderate vote in Congress that will bring Trump to justice?
If we fail this test, democracy will continue through a long winter.
But I believe we can, from a lesson I learned in Prague.

Ranger Graham Dorrance is optimistic ahead of the Vienna Rapids game.
On Thursday, Rangers hosted the Vienna Rapids, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive win over Villarreal in Spain earlier this month would secure them a place in the Europa League Group G.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Doran missed his debut in the season after a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use these results as a platform for better results in the future.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good side", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game because we thought we could get something, and we got one point.
Maybe we could have done something about it, but in the end, Frey was a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, but we came out in the second half and we were better.
Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get the three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good performance in the last game, but, with the fans, I'm sure we can make it and get a positive result.
Last year was really tough, from my injuries to the club changes, but now there's an optimistic factor.
The team is good and the guys are playing really well; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past behind and make it happen".
Women can't sleep, afraid of this retirement savings.
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few of them talked about it with family members.
About half of the nationwide surveys said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent say they have talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not know in advance what you want.
With your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you're going to get care, because that choice can be a big factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to cover these expenses.

The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palus on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the communication disruption, officials were unable to receive information from the administration of Donggala, an area north of Palo, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In the aftermath of the disaster in Palus, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongola on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island at the end of a narrow strip, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is located on the northeastern coast of Sulawesi Island, about 300 km (180 mi) from the mainland.
The governorate, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in Central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal area
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Moraval, on the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, there have been several tsunamis in the past 100 years in Palus and Tonggala.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Seismicity where earthquakes occur regularly.
There have been several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: An earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra on August 26 triggered a tsunami that devastated 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake strikes southeast Japan on Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastates the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the capital of the province of Padang, West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck during the rule of Peddie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: More than 500 people died in a powerful earthquake on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the north.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Treac Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on domestic violence charges, which contradict a report on domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers by the S.I.S.
According to the police report, when his acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crime, she grabbed her phone out of her hand.
According to KTUU, Palin is in the Mat-Su detention center and is under $500 bail.
In his court appearance on Saturday, when asked to confess to the crime, he said he was "completely innocent", media reports said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor charges, which carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first criminal case against the defendant.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palmi, called the police with a report of an alleged assault.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Her boyfriend claimed she hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after they linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck in the center of Sulawesi, north of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the incident are being shared on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palus as the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutor's office is choosing a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The New York State Attorney General's office is seeking the death penalty for a suspected New York City safecracker who killed eight people - a rare sentence imposed on a federal crime in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old suspect allegedly used a Home Depot rental car in October to attack pedestrians and cyclists along a bike path on West Side of Lower Manhattan.
To seek the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saifov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm on people, according to a written request for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of them carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipho on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, related to the gangland use of federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, violence and car damage charges.
The prosecution said the attack required "detailed planning and premeditation", describing how it was carried out with "hate, violence and rage".
"Saipul Khabelabovich Saipul has caused damage, damage and loss to family and friends Diego Enrique Angelino, Nicolas Clevens, Am-Laura Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Herman Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccio, a message of the intentions of the states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District of New York has had a criminal case about the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The most recent execution in New York City was a federal case in 1953 involving Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sayfa, a native of Uzbekistan, has not expressed deep remorse for the attack that day and for months after, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he did the right thing.
According to the indictment, Saifov told authorities he was inspired after watching an ISIS video on his phone.
He also demanded that the ISIS flag be lowered in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, a federal public defender in Saipan, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that a death sentence, rather than a life sentence without amnesty, will only prolong the trauma of this incident for all involved", Patton said.
The Search Team has asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP has said Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" at a conference in Tor today during a protest.
The former British leader said politicians should "feel the heat" from the euro-sect - as was suggested by Theresa May, MP, who should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that Britain would be "already gone" if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May, in line with her strongly held beliefs, was highlighted by the pro-Remain Tory, who joined a separate protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his Chequers compromise plan against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies have argued that she will try again to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Boone said at a Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted to break the checkered flag.
He offered to make Mr. Farage a colleague and take charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would be out by now", she said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we need to break the checks.
In his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in the world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Mr Boone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since 2016, saying: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and should stay is a complete lie.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checkers are unpopular in society, the opposition is not going to vote for them, they are unpopular among our party and our activists who actually go out into the streets and vote for us first.
Please put down your checkers and start listening.
In a sharp message, Mrs May added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they deliver on their promises".
Mr Farage said politicians must "feel the heat" if they are to uphold the 2016 referendum.
'It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
"They are trying to get a no-deal Brexit, and we are here today to say, 'We will not let that happen.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit betrayal, to feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which won us Brexit, and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and great United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, Remainers held a two-hour march through Birmingham into the city centre.
Several activists have been holding banners after the launch of groups this week, "Tories Against Brexit".
Labour's Lord Adonay mocked the Conservatives over the security concerns they face at the opening of the conference after the launch of the party app.
"These are the people who told us they could have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for no disagreements for no borders, for free trade in Ireland without borders", he added.
"This is a complete sham.
There is no good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to "watch closely" the presidential race.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would "watch closely" the presidential race.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a Western Massachusetts town hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Deeley, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He's been at the center of speculation about what he might get in 2020 from Trump.
On Saturday afternoon, Holloway held his 36th meeting with voters in a rat-a-tat-tat format since Trump took office.
The audience asked if he would run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government and put a woman in charge.
There was an arrest at LSU in the shooting that killed Sims.
In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The M.R.I.P.D. announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at 11:00 a.m. ET at a news conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the gunman.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed on the university's South Campus Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Sunday.
Wade defended his friend and was killed by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned, and he confessed to being at the scene of the crime, with a gun in his hand, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge County Sheriff's Department.
The 6-foot-6 junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton comes close to the World Championship title after the team demands he beat Sebastian Vettel.
It was just announced that Walter Bottas was ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, and Mercedes orders would play a big part in the race.
Bottas started well and nearly outplayed Hamilton after he defended his position in the first two corners and led Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel entered the pitstop first and left Hamilton to face the traffic jamming in the corner, which was to be crucial.
Mercedes came around late and came out from behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after several wheel-to-wheel collisions, causing the Ferrari driver to leave the interior space unwillingly free, risking a stop after a double-lap to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and on his 21st birthday was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then ran most of the race before he had his salts to finish quickly and outlast Kim Reikonen in fourth place.
He eventually came out on the 44th lap of the boxing event, but could not improve his pace for the remaining 8 laps and Reykonen finished fourth.
It's a tough day because Walter has done a fantastic job all week and turned out to be a real gentleman, telling me about it.
The team worked exceptionally well to secure first and second place", said Hamilton.
That was really bad gesturing.
President Donald Trump addressed a rally on Saturday to criticize Senator Diana Feinstein for not receiving a letter from Christina Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that events in the Senate had shown that the people were "disgusting, disgusting and liars".
"The only thing that can happen and the wonderful thing that's been going on for the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and disgusting and disgusting and lying", he said.
"When you see the releases and the leaks and when they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you release the information?
And remember his response -- I didn't miss the letter -- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I did not.
I'm not going to get away with it".
Then wait a minute.
We spread it... no, we didn't", he added, impressed by the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein detailing the charges Ford made against Kavanaugh in July, which was released in early September - but Feinstein denies the leak came from his office.
"I have not denied Dr. Ford's allegations, nor have I been cleared by the Feinstein Committee", Hill said.
"He told me it was confidential, and I took it confidentially as he asked".
But his refusal seemed to displease the president, who responded during a meeting on Sunday: "I'll tell you, that was a really bad gesture.
I may not have understood, but that was the worst gesture I've ever seen".
By continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president has declared that the Democrats are using the accusation to their advantage.
"They are trying to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the disgust, the hatred, they don't care who gets hurt, who gets manipulated to gain power and control, MediaTimes reports.
The Dundee Stars 5-3 The Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for a loss to the Belfast Giants in the Premier League on Friday with a 5-3 win in a replay against Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were soon up by two goals, thanks to the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvais.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took the home court lead before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
François Bouchard tied the score with Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen led to the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Premier League for the Adam Keefe people, who came from far and wide to watch Dundee's 2-1 defeat of Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, with the Giants having won their last three games.
Dwyer scored the opening goal in the fourth, 3:35 of the first half, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFall, a pass from David Rutherford, and Bowie doubled the gap four minutes later.
After the opening minutes, Sullivan scored a goal in favour of the hosts at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Cooney to tie the score at 15:16.
Before halftime, Dwyer pushed the Giants even further when he scored the second goal just before the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard returned to the game with another powerful shot at 27:37.
The combination of Cowan and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen push Dundee to the second-half finish for the first time in the match, and he led his team to victory, finishing fifth in the final standings.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
An air dispatcher dies trying to save hundreds of people on a plane from an earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight dispatcher was posthumously recognized as a hero after he helped hundreds of people land safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a tsunami caused by an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The area is still undergoing strong earthquakes and there are many remains in the ruins of the city of Palus.
But even as his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawar Agung refused to leave a post in the control tower, which was shaking, at the Mutyaara Si Al Jufri Palus Airport.
He remained in place to ensure the safe departure of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped off the air tower when he thought he was going down.
He later died in hospital.
According to Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirit, the decision has saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter to fly from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to another city, a larger hospital.
Unfortunately, he died the morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"We were very honest when we heard about it", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the Disaster Management Agency says the cities of Donggala, Siggi and Butong are under restricted access.
"The number of victims is expected to rise further, as many bodies are still under the rubble, and many are still unaccounted for", said a spokesman for the Soutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached 20 feet (6 meters) destroyed Palo, leading to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in aid and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Riza Kusuma, told Sky News: "Bodies are being brought in every minute by ambulances.
Clean water is not enough".
They ransacked supermarkets everywhere".
Ian Gelfund, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been worse"
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the country's armed forces: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
In Indonesia, more than 550 people were killed by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year.
Air New Guinea reports that one person is missing after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
An airline operating a flight to Pacific Laguna, Micronesia, now reports one person is still missing after it last reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sunken plane.
Air Newginy said in a press release that late on Saturday afternoon, he was unable to correctly count the number of male passengers.
The airline says it's been working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline failed to provide details about passengers, such as age or nationality, in time
Local boats rescued other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were taken to hospital on Sunday and all were in stable condition.
The exact sequence of events remains uncertain.
The airline and the United States Navy say the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed its target.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying too low.
"It's really good", says Janis.
Janes said that he and others managed to escape from the flooded plane, which was continuing to sink, through the escape hatch.
He said the crew were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the United States Navy, sailors working in a nearby port also helped rescue the passengers by taking a boat across the river to shore before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG-registered airlines, but none of them were related to Air New Guinea.
The analyst is running a timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, prosecutors filed a case against a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The United States Department of Justice analyst, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together a timeline of the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett said she had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellesi and Jessica were together the night of the death, contradicting her previous statements, reports the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers, when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday, confirming that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telly was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tells stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of his death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellez deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense is expected to begin their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge ordered that this trial be referred to a jury later that day.

They wanted to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common have recently been enjoying a renaissance in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York City mother-in-law sued a couple over a "racist" text
A New York City mother-of-two sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misrepresented text from her mother, who shouted that she was "just another black person".
The spouses deny that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to "rape".
Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when it was discovered that her new childcare provider, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"Not a black person", wrote Mrs. Placebo-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Morris.
After realizing the mistake, the embarrassed Placebo-Flaxman released Ms. Moore, saying that their departed African-American nephew was not doing his job well and was waiting for a Filipino instead, reports the New York Post.
His mom was paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home by Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for compensation for his release, and he's asking for $350 a day for a six-month period that he was originally hired for, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, don't do this", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations that they were racist by saying that releasing Morris was reasonable because they feared they could no longer trust Maddie after they had been abused.
"My husband sent her something he didn't want her to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you be willing to hand over your children to the people you were mean to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
I'll tell you what".
Comparing the lawsuit to "rape", Plasco stated that his wife was only two months pregnant and in a very difficult condition.
"Would you go with someone like that?
It's not a very pleasant job", added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately condemned the couple on social media, where they were accused of misconduct and logic.
Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers would not be positive about the narrator, says the new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, wrote: "It's hard to imagine yourself in someone else's shoes when you first read this book before it was published.
Now it's very exciting to know that we know about Paddington's enormous success".
To say that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a book about a little teddy bear, would be optimistic, because his work was rejected, and to add that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet and bitter" after his death a year earlier.
Of Paddington, whom she refers to as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father had quietly dismissed her for her possible success.
"He was a very quiet person, and he was not a conceited person", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it's almost like having a child describe something successful: you're proud of it, but it's not really your doing.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always paid homage to Paddington himself".
My son was dying, and I had to get a phone call to say goodbye.
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Natalie would repeatedly tell me that it was really bad, that she didn't want to do it", says Edna-Laperouse.
"Then Nadine called me to say that she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors gave him for his heartbeat was slowly dissipating and leaving his system.
He died and everything went to hell.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and close people.
I had to keep it all inside".
Finally, Mrs. Edna-Laperouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - despite the ordeal she had endured.
"No one knew", he said.
"I was in tears and my eyes were closed.
It's hard to explain, but it was on that flight that I felt this tremendous sense of compassion for Nad.
I knew that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Open cards from sad women to prevent suicide from the bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have posted postcards on Wales Bridge with ghost messages and phone numbers where people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he fell into depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davies, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a smiling face.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile would light up any room".
But before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that it won't work.
Mrs. Davis designed the cards to let people know that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphrey, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"She didn't say that she was feeling bad or was depressed or anything like that", he said.
"We noticed a change in her personality a few days before.
On Christmas Day, when the children were opening their presents, he didn't even look at them.
She said that her death was a big trauma for them, but they had to get over it: "It creates a big hole in the family.
We'll bring her to tears.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in the balance, and the FBI is investigating.
"I thought that if we could do what he was asking for - a time-limited investigation, within a limited framework - we could have some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would collapse on the back of a party caucus.
Why didn't Mr. Cavallo and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of desire is due to time.
The midterm elections are in five weeks, November 6th -- if, as expected, the Republicans go badly, they will be seriously weakened in their bid to get the person they want on the nation's highest court.
George Bush picked up the phone and called the senators and lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Bush and that he met his wife, Ashley, when she was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has prepared its report?
The vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate meeting that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to dissolve the union and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is falling under the Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said there were 1,127 resignations last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the high tariffs imposed by smugglers were important factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors end up being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them pass through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats displaced people as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and South, still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on halting nuclear disarmament.
This came after a historic meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June, when they generally agreed to work on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in this situation, we cannot unilaterally disarm", Mr. Ream said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a hysterical, and she has declared that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "sterile" and said he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I couldn't, but I think if a woman had become his replacement, she would have been called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Canadian testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanagh emotionally denied accusations that he had a sexual relationship with Dr. Christina Blaise Ford in his youth.
In his opening remarks, Kawano was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking when talking about his family and school.
She also unequivocally denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the accusation against her father "grotesque and a coordinated murder of characters" that was organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against democracy.
"I think he's disqualifying himself by making these statements and the way he's gone after Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh, if he resigned, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential solutions to the Affordable Care Act or Roy V. Wade because she is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn any Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say 'what's great,'" Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's fair to say, she's been crying for months and years, and she can't show it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was really helped by a woman who was in government somewhere who said she cried when she was angry, too, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off".
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, "That's great".
Tears are allowed in part as an expression of anger because it's fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my bitterest memories of my early work, where men dominated, was when I found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, and an elderly lady pulled me over the counter -- a cold manager I was always afraid of -- and she led me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they got what they wanted".
Patricia Schrader, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called the Monkey Business, and left the stage, Mrs. Schrader, very disappointed, decided there was no reason why she should not run for president herself.
"It was a bad decision", he laughed to me 30 years later.
"As a result, the child was already a candidate, the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone said it was a dwarf and his child.
Because it was too late for the campaign and she was behind the fundraising campaign, she vowed she would not participate in the parade unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who had given men $1,000 were only giving her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When she came out and announced that she wasn't going to formally campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder to raise funds and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism -- that she was angry.
"You think I had a nervous breakdown", said Mrs. Schrader of the press reaction to her.
"You thought the Clinics was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"Did he cry?"
How can a U.S.-China trade war be good for China?
The initial causes of the US-China trade war are under control, and while the battle is far from over, the cold war between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new tariffs that affected $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has responded each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to make the U.S. pay for its own eyesight, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to slow down anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means meeting the demand, and for the United States, for example, publicly backing down may be very uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for a country to start a recession is actually much more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged", says Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' to take in refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntarily returned refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to return voluntarily to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he made it clear that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe celebrates its Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. now has six straight losses on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Michelson, who had been trying to win most of the tournament, threw his first shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole before losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming the 1st player out of 4 to go 5-0-0, since the tournament's current format was created in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated 5-4 by the lowest rated Danish player in Europe, Torbjörn Olsen.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, has given a 2-1 lead to England's Ian Poulter, who may have been playing in his final Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia of Spain, the Ryder Cup veteran, won the tournament in all of European history by 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop now.
It was a tough year.
So I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm happy, I'm so happy to have the trophy back.
It's a team effort, and I'm happy to have been able to help", said Garcia, who was full of emotion after the European victory.
He handed the baton to fellow American John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a one-man game on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up with that guy's ears", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
The odd statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, with 14 major titles, is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled for weeks to find a sponsor, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finus, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's heartfelt performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning was a moment when we were a little bit in Europe.
We are destroyed.
The next day, we were in the house of the apostle Paul.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pay for your pants.
We are better".
