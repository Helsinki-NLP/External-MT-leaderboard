Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a coil, but do have other features of feathers - rays and breezes - the researchers concluded that the coil was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult feather suit and not chicken dung, even though the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers reasoned that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young tuna.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by forces reminiscent of tidal waves in the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts gravity on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is contained in a kind of halo, and is made up of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
"In an interview, he said the new variant was ""very worrying and alarming because of its very high mortality rate""".
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, at least two of whom were hospital workers.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day probably indicate that they are caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night".
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground", says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) team of astrogeologists and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the identity of the voter has been verified by the officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral law codifies the procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the competent voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following specific procedures.

Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may be worthless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered publishing photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists take a dangerous line when publishing images, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has told journalists that no further comment will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the leaked document is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the complementary pest control trial would be closely monitored by park rangers as the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park preservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional election council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
The partially violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing four people minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) said that 27 accidents related to the units were known.
"METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "slight".
"The department responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Rescue Service said no injuries were reported in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady because she needed a bathroom visit.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
"Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday".
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first boss, Luna died in the night with two moons, quite unique just like her, strong woman.'"
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was a freak as big as I am ... maybe even bigger ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she's better where she is now""".
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the respondents share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those polled think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition has been called into question.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to overcome his pain since they're banned from the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the water resources on Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and trash".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean planes fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be introduced, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
Fears of a lack of transportation opened the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Espa√±oladarwin finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be machined into all kinds of shapes.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
You can make an indicator with cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes shade depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together, then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman society they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women stayed together.
When you're calling someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and visual field.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it has done is to give us much easier and faster modes of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose felines) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all felines, and they live in large groups called herds.
Flockings consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
LeJobs act much like herds of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (the Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a sense of growling, screaming words.
Ozelotes like to eat small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find prey by sniffing the soil where they are.
They can see very well in the dark with dark vision and even move very stealthily.
When a small group of organisms (a small stock) is separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce food by using sunlight through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, much of the food we eat is plant, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its time, so it had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were obsessed with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the jaw, which meant that there was no chance of escaping anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a cleft tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasting items, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the hazel mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could lie on their side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food brought to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no cocoa, no potatoes, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, who were considered to be the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked on the farm; shops were just open dishes facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland as a punishment for murder, and when he traveled westward he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, because even if it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words, "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776".
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment (measuring 24 inches [75.6 cm] by 20 inches [62.2 cm]) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the Vichy French, French people who made a deal with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also in some way defines the size of society.
The European Union is a world-class institution, and it is a world-class institution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked all the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it fell to the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to abolish tax laws and customs between states.
The Articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be added, and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the world's second most successful team and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often counted as an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a conversion of the original grain production and employed Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, giving sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the format of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to produce the simplest whole-digit ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS) correspond to or are close to this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining order in an image.
It is claimed that the best position for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds meet vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European nations despite their differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of Christianity's main tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it dangerous even for neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolationism among most inhabitants and countries.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a future repeat of such a situation.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods; each stage of Chinese history, or each ruling family, was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jind dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history when thousands of people died in the battle to sit on the highest chair in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same was true of the military, where ranks within the army were now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to make revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his daily life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to meditate".
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on a mountain top north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know it exists.
Nothing is seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the great Sphinx".
The pyramid of Khufu was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The markings for "up-line" look like a V and the markings for "down-line" like a clamp or a square without a bottom side".
Up means you should start at the tip and push the strap up, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the strap) and pull the strap down.
A high pitch usually generates a softer sound, while a low pitch is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed line markings are there for a musical purpose, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open at dawn.
On one occasion, one of the mob members waved the head of an imperial guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of the US imperialist conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest of bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Lords of the Temple, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period of time during which the events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 13th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from that technology drives development or the technological imperative to the strict view that human fate is driven by a basic logic that is related to the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technological development itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are primitive, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, one could say that the motor car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The increased number of cars also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of determinism originating with writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic period, geography shaped individuals and, with time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which harmonized with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate in about 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its influence declined in the 14th century, largely because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its zenith between the 11th and 12th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slow routes of communication, the styles in the West could lag by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style, and one of the biggest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and so it is still in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, mannerism, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called 'wild'. Some wild children have been locked up by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to that of the specific pet, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, supporting learning goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it's also the little custodian in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalised in the software and is intended to challenge, guide and explain practices that may have been too challenging for the learner to handle on his or her own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing or educational, but it happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster homes are there to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home they came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in user theory.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Also, ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his essay "The President's Speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly".
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shreds variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of man to satisfy its need for the amino acids from the plants available.
Furthermore, the lack of this has serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In comparison, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested but also offers high-quality proteins containing all essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today".
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (1060 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without completely waking you.
If you usually turn off your alarm clock during sleep, you can set it at the other end of the room so that you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known fluid driver) before sleep, which causes one to have to go up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates with the opposite amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love in Mahayana and many techniques in Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of kundalini energy through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The godsyogan is central to Tibetan meditation, and through visualization of various gods, energy channels are purified, chakras activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to a cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be fought physically by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland while violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable late examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used them for milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Tamgetts were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, often felled by shepherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herder.
Wagon tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, the horses pulling them allowed them to reach higher speeds and to pull greater loads than on the then-slightly rougher roads.
Although the use of sanding machines was introduced early to keep the tracks in place, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became a practical practice, but the iron wore more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
The first rails made entirely of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, was not used to walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly because of man's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have been aggravated by overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
"Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on the Independence Hall lawn on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The best sign of poisoning may be an open can of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "bugger" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient relatives of bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bedbugs and bed bugs are residents, adapted to live in their hosts' nests or homes.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents waive their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method.
Experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-operating oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first hints that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that either marked the DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to work and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private driving.
Science now shows that this massive collectivity has upset the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the patterns of traffic cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
As is well drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus traffic tends to flow in a somewhat consistent manner and can be broadly presented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, three main variables have been linked: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the fairyland and the dayland.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the world's second longest and most voluminous river, with a flow of more than eight times that of the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at 9 kilometers wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main watershed is 6,387 kilometers long, and it draws its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and construction technique.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most government workers, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since the beginning of time, humans have known about basic chemicals, such as gold, silver, and copper, which can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything was made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Remember, there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when it first appeared, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have developed, the pencil has been downgraded and has fewer uses.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, never having to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on this side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the moon and thicker in the highlands.
There could be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around figuring out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
Theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what in their environment is it that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when managers start leading their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain "one in the crowd".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones can affect when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by the management locally.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which all members report.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, making the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behavior is supported by researchers in their research.
It has long been known that brain injuries, trauma, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that includes machine behavior, learning and intelligence.
AI research is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and even handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in finance, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of every classroom's curriculum, and often the teacher wants to take the students to places where buses don't go.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is remade every year, but previous versions may remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers generally improves this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces students to become more aware of the world. The need to satisfy readers' interest stimulates students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as present their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a variety of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north the beautiful, unspoilt scenery of Muscoca.
All of this and more makes Ontario what outsiders consider the quintessential Canadian.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or part of France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the area, which had a profound effect on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama circumnavigated the Cape of Good Hope and found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when saying no to men and do not be afraid to stand up to them (cultural differences do not make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of cream products, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you are visiting outside Goma, you should investigate the situation in North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arab rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which houses different wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship among South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily nature and entrance fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been likened to a glittering column diagram reinforced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the settlement on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on the former seabed along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 50 miles [80 km] into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is located in the Indian state of Haryana.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps  they contain some of the last remaining stands of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about a third is wetland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 ax deer in the area.
Buses leave from the district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 1,378 feet long, and have two aisles that are 11 feet (3.5 m) wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chacor region was populated by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of India", was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the indigenous people".
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo teams and players who are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Ca√±itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, please contact the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley credit cards and USD are often acceptable.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but UK and US currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures over +30¬∞C are common during the summer months
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: the rainfall remains about the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, you're to stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious deadlock in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's location between two ports, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are divided into three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most offer shade from the Maori ants.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-attended family beaches with a good variety of shops located on the beach.
"The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complex beer, but rather a pleasant and refreshing one.
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited to the journey.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
"To Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is unknown. A ""short black"" is an ""espresso"", cappuccino has a heap of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made year-round, and damage from any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Nevertheless, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cubmanet occurs near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so it usually does not live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveler security and assurance that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even package tours that combine flights and hotels.
They can also book your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests must first go through the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things are happening, you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because walking through ice causes really horrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city.
Casinos often do everything they can to make guests spend as much time and money as possible.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep guests cheerful and to keep them in the room.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as you would on unpaved asphalt.
During blizzards, in a very short time, enough snow can fall to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or hail or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted year round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shadowy and are best seen with binoculars.
"Walking safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of hiking either for a few hours or for several days".
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021, with some events being held at other venues around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics since it hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies due to the coronavirus are different, but at the end of March most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games should have started.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an iron board that can be borrowed even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear stretched socks, try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, welding).
There are different water purification systems, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travellers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes or other surcharges in certain places.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated wooded meadows.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive wisely. Steep inclines, narrow lanes, and steep curves are common.
Speed limits are markedly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and compliance is even more important.
Surprisingly, the cell phone coverage here is much better than many other areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid".
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
However, when used without a definite article, the term tends to mean the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the country, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the flavorings most commonly used by the Javanese being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stepping bars are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet may become trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but has a foot stuck in the step, he may be dragged away if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear high-heeled boots with a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that ensure that a ladder handle is released from the saddle if pulled back by a rider who falls off.
The Cocham√≥ Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, and it has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the countless mountain walls.
Outdoor activities, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you slide down a snowy landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski-lovers, who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a certain area.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Exercise as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norsemen in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than walking  but you will rarely get up to speeds like skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and under normal circumstances travelling through several countries would require multiple visa applications and passport controls.
However, the Schengen area functions more or less like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport controls repeatedly.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured objects are antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is important for many with other professions.
Historically, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting and the like and used reindeer mostly as pets.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries.
"Although often used, especially among non-Romani, the word 'Gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people".
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel restriction, your travel medical insurance or cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also wish to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may have different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
A travel guide is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often quick, general and simple to understand compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause injury, serious social disturbance or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are variations of them, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are types and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include severe snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may affect itineraries.

Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without an X or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.

Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the X-ray screening with their integrity and dignity preserved.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves that break off at the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology allows the backflow to be concentrated to a few deeper areas, and strong currents that lead to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, it's no more difficult than normal to swim back.

People may not expect patience and understanding to be needed for travelers returning home.

Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specific Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only land on boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

In general, it is no use even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travellers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably somewhere.
