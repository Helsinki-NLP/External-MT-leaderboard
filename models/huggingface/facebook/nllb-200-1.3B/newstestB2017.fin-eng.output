A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the steps of a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says that he did not know anyone who would want to hurt his brother. "He had finally gotten his affairs in order".
The body found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco man Frank Galizia, according to the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he was hired as head chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months earlier.
A representative for Sons & Daughters said the death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small, close-knit team, like a family, we're old", the spokesman says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends".
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend", Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who would want to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and generous.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us", says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was a diamond in the rough that shone every day", she says.
Anyone with information on the case is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Striking junior doctors demand new struggles at work
Representatives of junior doctors in the UK (who are mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission to take up new occupational activities in a dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Commission (JDC), a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is asking its entire government to support the extra workforce from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not resolved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the contract with the BMA in a vote in July.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The chair of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, posted a letter to JDC members on Twitter Thursday night, saying the board has "perseverantly remained silent" on issues that McCourt said led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: 'In light of this, the JDC government has voted to reject the new draft treaty altogether and demands that all our concerns be renegotiated formally.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government today sent a formal request to the BMA government asking for permission to proceed with gradually expanding work struggles from the beginning of September.'
The dispute has led to six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first complete strikes in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, the head of BMA's junior medical staff, resigned after the vote, as he did not accept the negotiated terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
Malawana told BMA members in meetings before the vote that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and would apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands for reconciliation and to formally end the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I was clearly impressed that Ankara was more eager for reconciliation.
The parties did shake hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he was barely warm even with his own restrained gauge.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly referred to his "good friend" Mr Putin, according to one report, five times.
I didn't keep up with the numbers.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return to an even better state than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I myself perceived his enthusiasm as the opposite.
But the continuing cooling of the picture of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the timing of the incident was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara in harsh words, accusing it of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Regaining true trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, though, it seemed the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has profited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has vehemently denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only arranged to get Putin to apologize to President Erdogan as he demanded.
This could have been a victory for Russia.
The benefits of a strict ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was nearly ousted in a failed coup last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic factor behind the settlement.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, particularly the charter ban, which normally brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has plummeted by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be relieved when air services can finally resume.
They put their faith in the late Song's rush to the Mediterranean.
And just this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruits and vegetables will fall as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Tourists go there, tomatoes come back here", was the motto of an article in the business magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it feels the West is reacting in a way that is not acceptable to the coup attempt.
Not to mention the old resentment over Turkey's speedy EU accession negotiations and Putin's meddling, who is keen to exploit the cold spell and to undermine Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, which has its own preoccupation with the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey could convey at their summit in a lavish seaside palace what one analyst described as an "alignment of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West are joining forces.
Despite the public conciliation, the two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has established itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It is telling that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told a press conference that they had not discussed the issue at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer a question about the differences between the countries, while Putin emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they could seek a consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete catastrophe caused by NATO member Turkey in shooting down a Russian warplane, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility the two heads of state should at least be in touch again.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from the market
According to the RBS CEO, the bank's operations outside Scotland will be reduced to business services only, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally part of the bank's global objectives.
The bank was forced to backtrack on its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and was forced to bail out.
In the meantime, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, including Six Nations rugby and the Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been seen as right to allow more national brands to take the lead.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but will not be referred to as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be changed to NatWeste, except for head office and listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also other smaller private banking brands which will gain more weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation for customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS is becoming an investment brand and because of the people we work for, because we are now becoming a much more diverse branded bank.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands".
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to move to a multi-brand bank, because at the heart of it is how we can make the bank better for our customers", says the bank's CEO.
"It would have been very interesting three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and we would have introduced brands.
But the work we do and the focus on the needs of the customer rather than our own needs has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time".
Frankie Dettori rode the Predilection to victory at Newmarket and reached his 3,000th win.
Dettori sprinkles champagne after winning two times in a row at Newmarket, which means he's won 3,000.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice in the same evening on the track in his home town.
Dettori, 45, of Italy, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in flat track racing.
He has been previously matched by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time world champion Dettori, who won at Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here, too.
I'm very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and feel great humility".
Dettori receives a standing ovation from Predilection after his victory .
Two jockeys have achieved milestones in the sport of barbell racing, namely champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, has won 4,493 races.
"Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of our time, and it is no surprise that he was the one who achieved this milestone, which few have achieved.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart.
He is a fantastic representative of the sport of racehorsing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have brought the breed fans over the years".
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races if he hadn't been racing on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Franky's riding career in the British races has been a winning one for almost 30 years, which has been great to watch.
He's a lively character, which is good for British racing, but above all he's an incredible jockey".
Frankie Dettori celebrated his achievement in his signature way by flying off his horse.
"From flying finishes to flying naked finishes, Frankie Dettori has been the icon of British racing for two decades.
There's plenty of room for the up and down.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 in the "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and been banned from competition for drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had trouble getting started, but he showed admirable tenacity, showed his doubters and returned to his best.
And he's not going to stop racing anytime soon. Dettori recently said he wanted to keep racing until he was at least 50".
Putin fired the head of the administration , Sergei Ivanov .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but no reasons were given for the dismissal.
In the course of the investigation, the Commission identified the alleged violations of the provisions of the CFSP and the CFSP.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
He later headed the presidential protocol department and the cabinet office, the Kremlin's Russian-language website reports.
The President thanked Putin for his appointment, saying: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the most important task of the administration is to support you as head of state, which means drafting laws and monitoring how the instructions you give are implemented".
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had personally asked for his resignation and recommended Vainoa as his successor.
Are those real smiles?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a member of Vladimir Putin's inner circle, and like Putin, he has a history with the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting broadcast by Russian state television with President Putin, both said Ivanov was withdrawing from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles on the cameras, few are convinced by the explanations, especially in this parliamentary election.
Are these firings the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been extremely suspicious of the official claim that the man being hailed as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website quotes Ivanov as saying to Putin: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and in some ways even difficult task for four years.
I have now been the President's chief of staff for four years and eight months".
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB, the state security service.
When Putin was the head of the FSB, the successor to the KGB, in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At one time it was thought that Ivanov might become the Russian president after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
But the task went to another person close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, then returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
" Criminal Minds " star Thomas Gibson was fired after beating up a producer
Gibson was involved in a violent altercation on a film set in Los Angeles last month.
The show's producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced the firings in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as Gibson, had apologized Thursday before his resignation was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry that this happened", he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the FBI for the next series will be released at a later date, according to a press release from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Gibson, 54, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
"I was hoping to see the series through, but that's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our amazing production team and most importantly, the best fans the show could ever hope for".
The series' 12th season will begin production in the United States on September 28.
The fish mysteriously landed in Banff's garden
Kevin Bain, a resident of Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind fish that have been washed ashore by a cyclone.
Bain, who lives 500 yards [500 m] from the coast, posted footage of the sightings on Periscope, hoping to find an answer to the appearance of these five-inch fish.
The Queensferry Overpass is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers have connected the Queensferry Overpass to the northern bridge and the overland bridge, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four "trunks" that are now almost complete around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 spindle-shaped spindles.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Cabinet Minister for Finance, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
Says Brown: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge.
We are all witnessing a really significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, with over 30,000 pieces of concrete and steel used in the construction of this section alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the ground and deck is a delicate operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge deck is now in place at almost 79% and the rest of the deck is being reinforced in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted".
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a major milestone in any bridge construction.
In this fantastic project, this piece represents the pinnacle of road and water construction.
After the last section of the road was installed and connected to the North Tower pillar road bridge, we had to close the remaining northern (i.e., earth) gap.
This was done by pulling the northern surface 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive operation, but one that required great precision.
It's massive, because it's 222 meters long from the ground, weighs about 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled up at about a 3 percent inclination.
And it was very precise, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small - only a few millimetres.
Thankfully, everything went well".
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Service reports the miraculous rescue of three men.
Three men stranded in the water off Anglesey were saved by a miracle.
The Moelfre RNLI's marine rescue station issued an alert at 1.20pm local time on Friday after its crew spotted the accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men were desperately trying to swim to safety as their boat continued its reckless journey without a guide.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them and imagined the worst", says Vince Jones, who sailed the lifeboat from Moelfre.
"By the time we reached the water, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them".
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, aged 60, was found exhausted, clinging to a bow and without life jackets.
They were all put on a coastal fishing boat and taken to a rescue station.
Says Vince Jones: "It is a miracle that these three men who were washed up are still alive and well.
The boat's engine had an emergency shut-off cord, but for some reason it had detached from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky on their journey".
The Pokémon Go hunt brings health and good luck
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many have lamented why teenagers and children no longer go out to play but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and moving.
Originally, screen time was limited to watching television, then video games and, most recently, smartphones.
So it's amazing to see that technology and the outdoor community are not mutually exclusive.
This, of course, refers to the Pokémon Go franchise, a game application based on the characters of video games created in the 1990's (which later became a cartoon series, game cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many popular cultural events, this one also stopped a bit before the new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries was delayed due to the huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go's user base had surpassed Tinder's and was almost as big as Twitter's.
So how does the game work?
In short, players go out to look for pokemon with their smartphones, which are tracked by GPS, and when they find the pokemon, they can "photograph" it (using the phone's screen image) or "capture" it.
The wild thing has taken the generation of younger video game players and lifted their butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps the "average worker" takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Cardiogram app for the Apple Watch, which found that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people who exercised 30 minutes a day suddenly jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it only sees raw data on movement levels.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have been a deafening one because the campaigns have been boring and the advertisers have been unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who are active are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a host of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people out there to do something they enjoy.
This is how it achieves the three basic health-supporting elements  exercise, fresh air, sunshine and joy.
It's possible to even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes the mischievous revelers.
And yes, someone can walk into a door while playing.
What's the big deal?
The breakthrough is complete.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit might have tracked your activity in the past, they didn't give you a reason to get moving, like Pokémon Go does.
The appeal of novelty will fade, and the use will diminish in time.
However, the success of Pokémon has led to more games combining applications and virtual reality with real-world activity, which increases the physical activity of people who go hunting and improves their fitness and health.

Simone Biles won gold in the women's gymnastics competition
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
The Dynamite jumps.
It's easy to get.
You're gonna be shaking your cheeks with a perm.
You're great at everything.
And now, finally, an Olympic medalist.
A 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around championship on Thursday, increasing the distance between herself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of silver-medal-winning "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform in the final of the women's individual all-around gymnastics competition on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman to win the all-around championship, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, if not all-time.
Biles burst into tears as his final points came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to a whole new level and puts him on a par with other sports superstars like Michael Phelps:
Biles has been the absolute master of his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, 10 of them gold, with such ambitious and precise programs that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest gymnast of all time".
In Brazil, there was one final contest remaining, which was between Biles and himself and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Coming home to Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States hug after winning gold and silver in the women's individual all-around competition in gymnastics at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles won his first gold medal on Tuesday as the point guard for the men's national team, which he had coordinated with the now-retired Martha Karolyn.
While Biles claimed that he never thought anything ahead when he was at the top for a long time, that's not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes his series of volts known as the "Power Card", is set to Latin music that could be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Stadium.
It's not a coincidence.
She's a force to be reckoned with, having been adopted by her grandparents when she was a child and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother, who found her while she was on a daycare tour of the gym where Boorman trained.
He hasn't lost a single multi-sport event since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Despite Mustafina getting a small lead in two laps, it was like a mirror.
And then there was the pom and the permanto, with Biles as the defending world champion.
He returned to the lead after scoring 15,433 points and crowned the Perm score with 15,933 points.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final scores, which was a mere formality, and tears began to appear around Biles's red, white and blue border, as the dream he had once written in his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor rematch of the four-year-old event, when he first shared third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the repechage.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call the team's "mother", was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flying saucers to the audience after his permanent program, and thus rose from loser to winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for the Bills, a widely circulated tweet by this 19-year-old earlier this week has taken on a whole new meaning:
Police say three people listening to music in a car were killed by a serial killer.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's deadliest mass shooting in a decade, the victims were sitting in a car talking and listening to music as they were shot, according to a police statement released Thursday.
According to authorities, on June 12th, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the side of the street.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, fired eight shots with a handgun, and then fled in another vehicle, the release said.
Police suspect that the triple homicide was not a robbery, as the assailant did not take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of the other adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard says police are now investigating whether the deaths are related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in areas predominantly inhabited by Latinos in the last four months.
"What is common to the incidents is that they have happened in residential areas in front of homes", Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that they are the work of the same perpetrator.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died instantly at the scene.
Witnesses told police that the three of them had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, police released a statement describing the shooting of an empty van just half an hour before the triple homicide, believed to be by the same gunman in both cases.
Investigators found shells and recovered a bullet from the car seat and shrapnel from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital small-headedness, a genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Picciutto, of which he was unaware when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was, 'I'm not gonna make it.
I can't do this.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all. Of course you're committed to it", he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not live at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be institutionalized.
"My initial reaction was that I didn't think that such a practice existed anymore", says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a roller coaster.
Edmund didn't sit up and start talking until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of the reference, which he uses to mean "sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not mean just ordinary sign language; it also includes the signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microephaly can be caused by a variety of diseases, from hereditary, as in Edmund's case, to viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or the Zika virus.
There's a lot of variation in symptoms and predictions.
It is too early to assess how this will affect the lives of people with Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I kept wondering what would happen to us
what happens to us".
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it".
But Picciuto has some hope for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you".
Heavy rains and flooding triggered large-scale rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are flooding their banks and spreading over a large area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flooded areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, says the agency is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipahoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning remains in effect through Saturday for most of southern Louisiana.
According to a press release from the weather service, the water may enter the area by another 76127 mm.
A flood warning was issued for southern Alabama on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile area.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are forecast to rise to record heights.
According to environmental conservationist Alek Krautmann, many riverside homes in the Baton Rouge suburbs could be flooded.
He also says that downstream flooding in Ascension County is a threat, as the flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, the Tickfaw River had risen to its highest level on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue efforts continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet [120 m] from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
The other half, who lived nearby, had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came in at a steady feed", Hansford says.
"It reached my waist.
His wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise that high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford explains that he and his family members are all disabled, and he is the only one of them who can swim.
Rescuers had rescued all three in a large military-style truck and taken them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were sheltered on Friday.
Meteorologist Krautmann says flooding is spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports that a nearby observer in Livingston reported that between midnight and Friday morning, nearly 350 mm of rain fell.
Krautmann says the soil has been heavily wet since the rains started on Wednesday.
Authorities say heavy rains and flooding of streets forced residents of Tangipahoa County to evacuate their homes and forced school classes to be canceled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council had told WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, a television and radio company, that 200 homes were underwater.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County Commissioner Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in the floodwaters.
Shelters have been opened for evacuees in the towns of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to recede", he says.
In the city of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, nearly 20 streets were forced to close because of flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to keep water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a big flood was in March", says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city council.
"This flood seems to be the same".
In Mississippi, rain continued steadily along the Gulf Coast, reports Rupert Lacy, Harrison County Fire Marshal.
Lacy said that Thursday there were reports of a handful of homes being flooded, but by Friday there had been no reports.
Keith Townson, the owner of Shopper Value Foods, says he's lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and hundreds more all the time".
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was shot multiple times, survives the Philadelphia shooting.
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, making him the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The baby's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of shots, his little body was full of bullets", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television station.
"I can't believe this is real".
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he has had several surgeries.
The family tells the network that they believe the boy will survive.
He was about to start his first year at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Two 29-year-old men and a 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old man was reported in critical condition and two others were in stable condition, CBS Philadelphia reports.
According to the TV company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossover between multiple gunmen.
The scene was filled with assault-type shells from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shelves on both sides of the street.
There have been several armed fighters at the scene and they have been actively involved in the shooting", Philadelphia Police Superintendent Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Bullets also hit many homes and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I'm told police are reviewing security footage.
Another victim of gunfire in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl who was hit in the arm by a stray bullet while playing outside her home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call the women's Olympic gymnastics team, and there's more than one reason for that.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as dominant as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latino women at the top of the spectrum.
For the last four years, the best female powerlifter in the world has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas emerged as the surprise winner of the games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible feats and surprising and masterful programs of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual all-around competition.
And my teammate, Aly Raisman, won the silver medal.
The views are like this at the top of the spectrum, but they don't look the same at nationwide gymnastics events.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the final five, since the next Olympic team in gymnastics will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs run by their parents, who pay for the training costs, facilities, travel, performance costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
Most gymnasiums are located in affluent residential areas that can support activity.
Training of gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez' coach Maggie Haney have both coached amateurs since they started gymnastics.
We must provide more affordable and more accessible physical education for the countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem organizations have provided free or low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latino), some of whom have gone on to national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic Games.
Exercise develops strength, agility, and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has inspired thousands of young girls who now want to get into gymnastics, and it's absolutely amazing.
Participating in some form of sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for the true "girl power" you showed by winning the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to begin their journey as healthy, strong, successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by adopting a revised agreement with the British Medical Association, the trade union representing doctors, but of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors, or specialist doctors, who took part in the vote, 58% rejected the proposal.
Health Minister Hunt announced plans in July to force the agreement into effect, saying the UK's public healthcare system (NHS) was "in no man's land" and that any further delays would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care during non-social times.
The chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, issued a statement last night, saying: 'The junior doctors are still very wary of the proposed agreement, particularly because they fear it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
We have only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so we have to move on now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant to discuss it and sometimes even not reacting in any way.
I did, despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, revoke the contract and address the concerns of the junior doctors.
If this is not done, junior doctors are ready for new measures of labour combat".
The previous strike at the end of April postponed almost 13,000 routine procedures and 100 000 appointments, as nurses and consultants were called on to join the strike force.
The Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over the amendments by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the contract.
The chief executive of the NHS, Daniel Mortimer, appealed to junior doctors not to go on strike again.
"Working campaigns achieve little or nothing", says Mortimer, "but they put pressure on teams and services already on the fringe, causing anxiety, distress and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.
We have been in talks with the Junior Medical Committee for the last two months and, together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the disclosure of irregularities.
Employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues  such as development, training flexibility, retraining, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, school leavers and the gender pay gap in care  were a sign of how seriously employees, Health Education England, responsible for health education, and the Department of Health want to stick to the agreements they made with the BMA in November, February and May".
A drug that costs about $2.40 a day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are now getting access to the drug, which costs about €2.40 a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for longer-term use.
The anticoagulant medicine tikagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
It is currently given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), part of the British National Health Service (NHS), has recommended that tickerelor be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the British National Health Service (NHS), has recommended that tiger gel be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a fatty substance that builds up in the walls of blood vessels and causes plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood from reaching the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot breaks out, it can travel with the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new heart attack is higher in people who have had one.
Tiggrelor, produced by AstraZeneca in the UK and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tubers.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that ticareglor be given at 90 mg for the next 12 months, then reduced to 60 mg, and aspirin given twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says: "Although effective treatments are available to effectively prevent disease progression and symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack have another attack or stroke  often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
We have evidence that tiger gel combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation of temporary use of tiger gel increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it".
As there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of tikagrelor  especially with regard to the risk of bleeding  when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment for that longer period.
The political correctness climate led to a flourishing of voting fraud in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked last year for corruption, prompting the government to issue a statement
The climate of political correctness has led to a blind eye to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report released today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticized the police, election monitors and city councils for turning a blind eye to electoral fraud "because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Pickles, a former minister of local government and now a powerful anti-corruption figure, said that religious intimidation of voters was so bad that police should have been allowed to set up security lines outside polling stations to protect the intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At this time, the voter will only have to give his name and address.
The report also proposes that after the vote, the finger should be dipped in ink so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He called for improved access for journalists to documents of the State Council and decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud in the wider context of local government", he says.
The British Prime Minister has asked for a report on the East London Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, a special election court ordered the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, to be dismissed for corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "violently distorted" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islam.
Rahman was said to "use the premise of his campaign that it was the religious duty of every believing Muslim to vote for him".
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or given fraudulently by the person voting by impersonating someone else.
Sir Eric said evidence of the fraud was obtained from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the postal fraud allegedly committed by senior members of the Muslim community who were pressuring people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring ID at the polling station.
The report states: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the wishes of their elders, particularly in the backward communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh".
"There was concern that . . . the state institutions had turned a blind eye to such activity because of the 'politically correct' oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 suggestions to clean up the system, including banning the processing of postal ballots by political activists to prevent 'voice-picking'.
The report on which Theresa May is currently working also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options whereby voters are required to present an identity card before voting.
Dipping fingers in the ink after voting so no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
The Commission will be responsible for the implementation of the European Parliament's budget.
Prohibition of political activists from processing completed postal votes and postal envelopes.
The police have the right to form security chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to bring charges of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 to extend voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Allowing only English at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training to ensure that staff are supervised by a rule that only one person at a time can go to the polling booth.
Sir Eric is a harsh critic of the London police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and numerous illegal practices", he says.
"He was found guilty without a reasonable doubt and the criminal justice threshold was exceeded on many grounds".
He also criticised the ineffective 'cross-checks' by the departments responsible for the electoral rolls of the city council.
"The court's decision in the Tower Hamlet case last year was a wake-up call", says Sir Eric.
'Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and denial by some.'
The Olympic cyclist's likeness to the Duchess Catherine and other twins going wild at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week were blown away by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is staggering.
But social media discussions suggest that the 24-year-old Olympic champion is far from the only champion athlete to have a similarity to a well-known figure.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces that shine on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of all the Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is evident.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the U.S. men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine's twin seen on bike lanes, many people have been posting on social media that one of the archers could be the twin brother of actor Leonardo DiCaprio's favorite.
Brady Ellison of the U.S. men's archery team caused a storm on Twitter after pictures posted of him reminiscing shockingly about the star of the movie "Wolf of Wall Street".
Ellison was aware of the rise of social media and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he reminded him of DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance that much, except maybe the beard and the mustache", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take that as a compliment".
The 2012 London Games highlighted the similarities between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which will undoubtedly be further highlighted at these Games.
The large, eye-catching Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafinaa has been called the double of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the beaches, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison of the television series Glee for years.
This user says that Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor from the movie Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, highlighted by their powerful eyebrows and lips, has long been noted.
Russia's Yulia Efimova, a silver medalist in swimming, resembles actress Annalynne McCord not only for her beautiful tan skin and blond hair, but for the United States team's Nathan Adrian, who fans call "the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their facial shapes and eyes.
Not only that, this Twitter user was thrilled that others saw the similarity.
This user is wondering if the resemblance of a couple is a good reason.
One tweeter recently expressed his happiness that "other people on the Internet agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter look alike".
The American football star and the Dexter actor really do resemble each other in striking facial features and eyes.
Many have also noted similarities in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jenning and actress Laura Linney, and in the broad smiles of gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Gabrielle Union, star of the film "Let It Burn!"
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes for saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish in the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay stunned viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost her breath" and "died like a pig" during a race.
The narrator, Byron MacDonald, thought his microphone was off when he started to give his own opinion at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on to the CBC news team to bring color, was heard to say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese boy has your balls, baby.
He was too excited, he left in a hurry and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that".
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam in the second half with a time of 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly, shocked by the commentator's tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese girl died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet".
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, who swam in the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle final, was described as saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese chick, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with angry comments criticizing Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
The tweeters didn't hold back when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis tweeted, "Wow #ByronMacDonald, you are the best.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist bunch. #disgusting".
CBC host Scott Russell was quick to apologize for MacDonald's remarks: "We apologize for the comment made about the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened".
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
My fellow commentator, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and pasted its apology on over 90 other tweeter comments complaining about MacDonald's remarks.
The TV company also quickly issued a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for their being broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night's broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the record, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron deeply regrets his words".
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his remarks by saying he didn't mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for the comments I made last night after the women's broadcast", MacDonald said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I did not mean to insult you, and I am very sorry".
In Primark , a woman who unobtrusively fitting underwear in the middle of a store shocked customers .
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped in the middle of Primark to adjust her underwear.
To make matters worse, he assessed what he looked like in his underwear, took them off his foot, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to tour and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
Primark chain store in Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the same time, says that after trying on underwear, a woman she did not know got dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He relates what happened: "People could not believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own sweaters and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do so in a disguise, but he did so without any shame.
Everyone was staring as he took off his underwear, which he was trying on, and apparently he didn't like it, because he put it back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like any of it, getting dressed, and walking out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks  or the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had worn".
Davidson, 33, of Kent, adds: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that someone else has worn and that hasn't been washed".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the store staff tried to remove the items from the sale after she left  which is correct.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and find that someone else has worn them without having them washed afterwards", adds Davidson.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister commented: 'The Prime Minister is aware of the situation at the Folkestone shop on Tuesday 9 August.
All those products have been withdrawn.'
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga .
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little bit safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, a New York City Grand Master of the Krav Maga League, and asked him for advice on how to survive a near-sighted robber or assailant.
This video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching from in front or from behind.
If an attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the line of fire, Mizrachi says.
Then, grasp the weapon so that it is between your elbow and shoulder, and strike the assailant in the face with your free elbow.
Then, kick the attacker to your knees, and when he goes through the pain twice, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and fall back, holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is similar if an armed assailant is approaching from the front, you have to move away from the line of fire, grab the weapon and turn it around so that the assailant cannot fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the weapon and punch the attacker with your fist into the chest, turn the weapon away from the attacker's grasp, back away, and keep the weapon aimed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video of Mizrachi doing it.
But remember, the safest way to get rid of a robber is to give up your cash... unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
World traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
A British world traveler put his resistance and his cake-making reflexes to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk-based presenter and travel guide Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resilience by licking euro banknotes, handwriting at Piccadilly Circus, a washing-up button in a train toilet and a Russian pay phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the audience where his tongue was pushing.
The experiment was made into a documentary film, Ian Wright, on the trail of the inner force, and the results were surprising.
The thought of licking the toilet seat of a train may be disgusting, but in fact, there are more bacteria in the kitchen sink.
As Wright travels around Europe, he interviews doctors and other medical professionals about reinforcing good gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested his gut's endurance by traveling the world and eating strange and strange things.
No doubt licking the hand tools of railway stations and the toilet flush button challenged Wright's resistance.
In the documentary, Wright says: "Since I was a child, I have been quite careless about my health, putting everything in my mouth, such as dirt, worms, and spit".
In the movie, he really proved himself to be worthy of his reputation.
The only border crossing was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured over 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, freshly washed hands usually have less than 60.
The line came across a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units, and in freshly washed hands, the same figure is less than 60.
Wright is exploring the trail of the inner force in a documentary produced with Valio, where the number of bacteria in different places is made visible, such as in the bathroom.
In the documentary, Wright says: "This is about the worst smell I've ever smelled in a bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
It's so disgusting, I don't really swallow anything here".
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright  The Inner Force in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, helps to strengthen the gut's good bacterial resistance and immunity.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of Snacks, Juices and Fresh Products at Valio, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that's fascinating to watch, but also tells you about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we came up with the idea of asking Ian to come along".
Gastrointestinal health has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into the wider public eye, rather than just talking about products, and tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to immunity.
Gastrointestinal health has become a global trend, and this document can help us to inform consumers in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor!"
The film's director Tom Hakala adds: "Let's just say I would have lost respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, some of the objects were easier for Ian to lick, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrow-fights on tape".
In a survey carried out by the European Food Safety Authority in 2015, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria in particular to stomach and intestinal health, and 58% reported at least occasional use of products to which lactic acid bacteria has been added.
A disturbed family destroyed a townhouse in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
The family left £50,000 in damage to a townhouse after they were evicted for terrorising the neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been evicted from their Saltash, Cornwall, apartment following numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple were forcibly removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental company were shocked to find the apartment in a state of disrepair.
Holes were drilled in the walls, floorboards were torn off, garbage was spread on the floors, and graffiti was sprayed on the walls.
The couple have now moved out, and they are believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears the house may no longer be salvaged.
He says: "It's been a nightmare for the people here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to weigh in, as the property is likely to be known as a not-so-pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, as is its name".
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time, and police said that the family's terrorism included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of neighbors, use and distribution of drugs, and loud shouting, arguing, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an injunction for disorderly conduct.
In several rooms of the house under demolition, old debris was found.
The house had been sold to drug dealers before, and the floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street, and the police were called regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Authority forcibly evicted the couple this week after first giving them 11 weeks' extra time to move out voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction - they said their life was hell on earth.
One neighbor says: "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been hard.
The police have been here an incredible number of times".
"We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted".
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of enforcement at Cornwall Housing Authority, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were called to the scene regularly.
Trash and old toys were thrown on the wild walls of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant has not taken any responsibility for his or her own and his or her family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last thing the Cornwall Housing Authority considers.
This case was very difficult, for the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to watch in the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members who participated in the work and who offered to give us information.
I hope this step forward will improve the well-being of neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour is not acceptable".
Fitzpatrick says the family's three sons had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were in their 20s.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction.
The workers must now clean out the waste bins surrounding the house.
Police raided the flat in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possession of a Class B drug with intent to sell.
He claimed the money was for the headstone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband reportedly moved into a private apartment in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms were graffitied.
Police say they're demanding evictions for tenants who break the terms of the lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police says the eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who are continually defying the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they wish without prosecution, as well as to those who suffer from such behaviour", says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying military jet that hopped ashore frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers were shocked at their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion crashed at an alarmingly low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight, and it was not a threat to safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were thrown into a panic as a low-flying jet plunged over a crowded beach.
Dramatic images show a military plane approaching sunbathing tourists on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal, at close range.
The vacationers stood up, understandably concerned about the roar of the jet's engines, which began to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who took pictures of the dramatic flyby and posted videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who relates: "It passed the shore twice at a very low altitude, and there was a moment when it looked as if it was going to plunge to the ground".
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure that the plane would fall on me".
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when a plane suddenly appeared and flew at an alarmingly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which caused the plane to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke from nearby forest fires interfered with visibility, but the Air Force said that this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that due to poor visibility caused by the fog and smoke from the fog, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight, where the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Exto first half result better than expected
The Social and Health Department of South Karelia (Exote) achieved a better result than planned in January - EUR 3.4 million in June.
Exoto's profit was EUR 4,3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote is trying to reduce the number of operations.
The excess is a surplus to cover a previous deficit.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy treatments for patients.
The full year result is expected to be EUR 4,6 million better than planned.
The Executive Board will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Forces soldiers took their oath of allegiance at Immola .
70 Marines from the Coast Guard Academy took their oaths of allegiance on Friday.
A military parade of the Coast Guard and Marine Corps was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Forces Medical Course was held at the garrison sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 of the guards.
Special border doctors are trained for the demanding tasks of border security, intelligence and combat.
They're on duty 347 days a week.
This year, 310 young people applied for the special needs doctor.
They were invited to the selection tests.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The meeting was attended by five veterans of the frontier troops during the war.
The average age of those who were involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
A district ahead of the robbery - Crime intelligence helps in the investigation of crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has had an RTA, or Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The police department in Hämeen has a total of four officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
The Chief of the Staff is Lieutenant Bahde.
In addition, the unit's strengths include a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinn.
Everyone works in civilian clothes.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit is producing a variety of reports for the other police.
In particular, it has obtained information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working practices
The creation of the analysis units is the latest in a series of reforms to the police's working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less and less likely that police will go to the scene of a fight only when they receive an alert.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will help to direct daily police activity to where it is most needed.
The reform of the police administration led to the establishment of one Crime Intelligence Centre, three national units and a Crime Intelligence Unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which is linked to the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, is responsible for national activities.
PTR units, as the name suggests, are staffed by people from the police, customs and border guard.
The RTAs, in turn, operate in areas divided by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local and national police forces.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit is tasked with knowing what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of one's own institution, because so does crime.
The people who work in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the regular cops.
The unit uses registers, alert database and observations to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, prolific crimes or similar crimes.
This is called a series, and it's one of the most important tools in criminal investigation.
Every human being has his own way of doing things.
The fingerprint is also visible in the work, whether it's honest or criminal.
The way you do it, you get a certain image of the perpetrator.
The ranking can be done either by the act or by the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
RTA employees don't walk around town with their collars up, but their work isn't entirely public either.
As well as the methods used by the criminals themselves, it is not reported because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police efforts to combat crime.
The police shall disclose their procedures to the public if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
One such case was the newsworthy method of marking vacant apartments used in the early summer home burglaries.
In it, the creators put a stick, button pin, or piece of tape on the front door of a dwelling to test whether the occupants were really on the move.
The preliminary investigation material shall be publicly available at least to the parties.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest people order a court-ordered record, which may reveal, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time we see a thief, we'll leave with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppäs from Hämeen Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepolaa from the East Finland Police, Crime Commissioner Sami Joutjärveä from Joensuu Police Station and Crime Inspector Arto Tuomelaa from the Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical action.
The background is a reduction in the labour force and in the amount of funding.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken 30 years ago.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted in the form of a loan to the State.
National cooperation involves the collection of information from outside the institution and the Finnish borders.
A London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
The news reports that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard that the Sultan was killed in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The sultan was 17 years old, and according to his family, he was just planning to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"It is only to be hoped that this will serve as a warning example and testament to people to understand that this is a real risk to go into a war zone - and one that will make people give up the decision to leave", says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and continued their journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that the Sultan had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he's confident that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have refused to confirm Garland's nomination since Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that the next president will choose the person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a telephone interview Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland "with great certainty".
Reid's spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to "swing the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid says the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "subordinates" and "forerunners" of presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He says Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats , the nude calendar belongs to women as well as men .
Treats is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to launch a calendar inspired by Pirelli, designed in the 1970s.
Instead of public models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old-school Playboy magazine, saying: "Playboy is for men.
I do this for women".
Apparently, he thinks the same about the calendar.
"We need to bring back the timeless and classic nudity, where women, as well as men, can enjoy and be inspired by these images that glorify the female body", says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"I'm sure women will want to be involved in this project because it's going to be a beautiful work of art".
Those who wish to be a model can submit their photos online or participate in open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
The allure of vinyl: Who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you write your angry objection in the comment section, labeled No All Lonely Middle-Aged Men, this claim is based on real research.
According to the research company YouGov, the much-talked-about new arrival of vinyl records is not the millennial boom, where millennials want to feel the physical in their hands, but instead the nostalgia of middle age.
The most likely age of a person who recently bought a vinyl album is between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely to buy.
It is also not just the desire of the hobbyists to grab records, but the significance is emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results accurate?
If this blog were a televised news show, the camera would follow me as I walk down the busy Soho Street, wearing a grey, unadorned suit, and I'd be excited, bend my hand into a cup, and say something traditional like, "Let's find out".
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and luxury as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises formerly owned by private entrepreneurs, a handful of specialty record shops still remain.
I would probably ask the cameraman to stop the camera for a moment as I get very close to the men visiting these stores and try to assess their age and character by observing them.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray's shop (two young women, three middle-aged men at the time) to Reckless Records (eight middle-aged men, one probably in her twenties) is on a conference trip to London in the afternoon and spends his spare time looking at the shops.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I guess I am", he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records".
These discs fill the walls of his living room, as you can see in the picture.
The reason he has bought so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income, which means he can now buy records he could not afford when they first came out, and buy back things he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I buy a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to have it", he says.
He agrees that vinyl buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my bad".
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients fit the YouGov profile.
But he has discovered a new kind of people, influenced by the media hype, who have heard about the re-emergence of vinyl records and feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"The discussions I had with people showed that they had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back", he says.
This may explain the boom in vinyl recordings of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, a movement like Phonika realizes that it provides a comforting community for like-minded people.
Wez says some older customers are particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
The digital world may be overwhelming some of the vinyl fans, for whom returning to the familiar record boxes means permanence and reminds of the happy days of youth.
"I think it's sometimes used to fill a hole or to acquire material possessions as a form of comfort", says Wez.
"I feel that way as a collector myself, and I think so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things".
"We're like social workers!" shouts Wez's coworker from behind the record.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of the vinyl purchases made in the previous month had not yet been listened to.
The poll also found that 41 percent have a record player that they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers have no record player at all.
At this point in the news, I'd probably be showing a serious face while browsing through the messy bossa nova collection.
The new arrival of vinyl records also has a "cup phenomenon" that Jonny, 42, a salesman for the Sounds of the Universe movement (which at the time had three middle-aged men as customers), has observed.
"A customer recently came to the store and said that he didn't have a record player, but he wanted to buy a Radiohead record so he could put it on his shelf", says Jonny.
"The number of such customers is not large, but they do exist.
They're more interested in the material than the music.
Some of our customers tell us they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers, just starting out".
The customer base is much more diverse at Fopp, which I'll be next, and they've dedicated an entire floor to vinyl records.
The customers are couples in their 70's, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of the customers is a delight, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the jazz rocking from the speakers, the newest sex-obsessed synth pop from Wild Beasts.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to tell the extent of the psychological trauma from standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, watching various discount records.
He's more of a spectator than a shopper.
He says his income is low, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen to on a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of vinyl is"... he sighs, and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique".
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who you'd think were swinging their jeans, but instead they're just gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment, and I see a father and daughter who are considering buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, the walls of which are filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the staples of any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just a piece of furniture and part of it is so high you can't even reach it.
They're pure art vinyl.
But considering that all the means to get attention for these records could mean more money for the industry and send a few clients on a search tour to Soho, there's hardly any reason to complain.
Not surprisingly, the population most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends the most money on luxuries, such as vinyl records.
While my research suggests that YouGov's findings are correct, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist both in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be very involved in school or in the workplace.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings browsing Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old who plays a TV host, who stares at the frightening, unpredictable middle-aged men.
The holker, or ice shark, is the longest-living vertebrate  video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on earth is a shark.
According to the researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark ever recorded was a female, measuring five meters in length, who lived to be 272,512 years old.
French court rejects application for dismantling of jungle collier shops
A French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camps where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be allowed to dismantle 72 temporary shops set up in the refugee camp, which sell a variety of goods to the residents, from cigarettes to energy drinks and haircuts, and that temporary restaurants can buy tea for 50 cents or basic food for a few euros.
According to the Calais prefectural authorities, these shops and restaurants must be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they pose fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, as the free meals provided by the state-supported organization and others are not enough for the camp's growing population.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary shopkeepers, but considered the concerns of the prefect of Calais to be "fully understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the food shops, cafes and restaurants in the camp are far more important than simply providing food for people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under the curfew was the camp's Jungle Book Kids Café, a non-profit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum counseling for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, who are the most vulnerable.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition demanding that the children's café be preserved.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, closing it "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in the number of refugees this summer, the population of the jungle cholera has risen to a record high of more than 9,000.
Food prices in Finland fall much faster than the EU average
Food is falling steeply in price in Finland, to the delight of consumers and the chagrin of producers.
The price of food has fallen by almost 5% in Finland in three years, while the average price in the EU fell by 0.9%.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has gone up by 1%.
Over the last three years, Finland has been the second most food-price-deprived EU country with a similar level of wages to Finland.
Of the countries of comparison, only the United Kingdom has seen food prices fall faster than Finland.
The data is based on an article by Ilkka Lehtinen, head of development at the Statistical Office, published in the blog Tieto & Trendit.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices in proportion to the general trend in consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership gave us", says Lehtinen.
Then came the turnaround, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now being weighed by the Russian food import ban, which has halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policies have helped the Finnish consumer in the short term", says Lehtinen.
The price has also been affected by increased competition in industry and trade.
The large retail chains S-Group and Kesko have both reduced their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as a spectacular advertising campaign.
Finland is still not a country of affordable food, even though food prices have fallen considerably.
In 2015, Finland was the fourth most expensive EU country for food, with a similar level of wages as Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would be the third cheapest country to sell food from similar countries at a wage level.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the comparison countries were seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell food cheaper than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we need to halve VAT to the average level of EU countries and continue to compete on prices", Lehtinen writes.
The paper points out that his calculations on the VAT rate are indicative.
School ain 't like it used to be .
Returning to school, you may find that the school has changed during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools and will be introduced at the beginning of the school year in all primary schools.
It is the guideline for all Finnish schools.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan outlines the official goals.
The new guidelines have been in the making for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
For example, the teaching of fine writing is being abandoned and instead the schools are being trained in coding.
Swedish is taught from the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies from the fourth.
The biggest change, however, is in the role of the pupils.
We used to think that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is an attempt to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-living vertebrate shark has been found - it can live up to 400 years
The ice-cold Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach maturity until it is 150 years old.
It can live for another 250 years, a new study reports.
The numbers make it the longest-living species of vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is surpassed only by the Icelandic stork, whose oldest known individual is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females reach out longer than the dogs, growing to over five meters.
Because of the slow growth rate, recorded at only about one centimeter a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of the adult sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon deposition of the lens.
The average age of the sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fishes in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter Amazonian, turned out to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have shown that ice-skates reach sexual maturity only at over four millimeters, the researchers estimated that they are about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fires nearly 300 salesmen without reducing staff .
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off at the department store company Stockmann.
The cooperative ventures in the company, which was in difficulty, ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of some 300 jobs, the majority of which will be carried out in the form of redundancies", Stockmann said in a press release.
It says that the number of shopkeepers will not be reduced to avoid the impact of customer service.
In addition, about 80 support workers are offered new jobs as salesmen.
The Stockmann negotiations involved some 3 000 employees.
At the time of their launch, the reduction requirement was estimated at around 380 employees.
The reduction in staff will result in annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved over the course of next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme aiming at savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making a profit from the goods trade.
Although the Group's adjusted operating profit improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, the goods business is still loss-making.
According to Lauri Veijalaisen, acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
'The staff reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure a positive operating result for Stockmann Retail in 2018', Veijalainen states in the press release.
The improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second quarter turnover and profit.
Lindex's operating profit increased to EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
Last year, at the same time, the total turnover of the Stockmann Group was 4,1 million euros.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will be lower than last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be somewhat positive this year.
Friday will be the driest day in the north with temperatures below 20 degrees across the country .
The low-pressure center over northern Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, reports HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
The central parts of the country will also experience droughts, but the southern parts will be wet.
Temperatures are no longer very summery, with the country's mercury below 80 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C].
In the northern rainy areas, it's going to be 10 to 15 degrees.
The Kenyan national team is shaken by a doping scandal. A strange explanation for the coach's ploy
Kenyan track and field coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah had performed as a national athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform with is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenya national team, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
Doping officials came to report Anzrah to the authorities.
So, according to the report, Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, even signed the papers.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour", Kip Keino, president of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
The Olympics are starting on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich, who finished fourth at last year's World Cup, is a pre-season favorite in Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan national team claimed that Anzrah was travelling on an athlete's credit card only to get free meals at the racetrack.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for testing.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials, fearing that he would be exposed", the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio's stadium is empty
Where is everybody?
Not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio, watching a sporting event.
The Rio Olympics began on Friday, but the world's top athletes were allowed to show off their skills to a bewilderingly empty audience.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day's matches and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening matches have been sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was filled with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics have attracted attention even before the Olympics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the rugby, melon, and equestrian galleries.
When Brazil's medal-winners Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was filled.
After the Brazil double, the Netherlands played Russia, and the 12,000-seater crowd was only about 30 percent full.
The lack of success is explained, at least, by the fact that struggling Brazil is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic Games are strange to football-loving Brazilians.
True, even the first game of the Brazilian soccer team failed to fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, spokesman for the organizers, said over the weekend that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold, a significant drop from four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell", Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though tickets cost nearly half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to over a thousand euros for the opening.
More than half of the tickets are under 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio, this is not yet allowed because organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, though, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for less well-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
At the Rio stadium, there were enough empty seats in the morning.
Even a beach volleyball on the sands of Copacabana has not attracted the public.
The dirty middle class competed in London 2012.
We had enough people in the papers.
A new way to protect nature - acquire land rights
The Helsinki Foundation is involved in nature conservation in the most innovative ways.
The foundation, which was set up last year, is acquiring ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem the rights to the land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire it for the payment of the landlord's fee.
The holder is granted a veto over his 187-square-foot plot, which means that in practice the approval of each holder is not required if the land is to be redeveloped.
You can also get the rights to more blocks.
The acquisition of a management right is something tangible that can be bequeathed or given as a gift.
No need to go carrying banners or chaining yourself somewhere to protect nature", explains Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the management rights for his enterprise.
The acquirer of the management right receives precise location information from his block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website displays the names of those who have acquired the land rights on the same map as the block information for the land area.
Leviakangas sees the risk of his conservation project only in the event that the foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a non-profit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation might act in some way that's unethical or commercial, but that shouldn't be possible.
The Helsinki Foundation's Holtija project is based on the idea of protecting natural areas so that they are untouched and at peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or by donation.
It finances its activities mainly by selling the rights of ownership, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The Foundation's goal is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and is planning to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities at the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Mall from 13 to 19 August.
Bicycle thieves are the worst in Turku . Look at your hometown .
Turku is the worst city in Finland to be hit by bicycle thieves.
More bicycles were stolen this year, as a proportion of the population, than in the nine other largest cities.
Based on the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police, the Helsinki News Agency found out how many bicycles and bicycle parts per thousand inhabitants were stolen in the ten largest cities in the world between January and August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti topped the list.
According to police records, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In contrast, in Espoo and Kouvola only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"Some cities have twice the number of burglaries per capita", describes Tommi Reen, police inspector for the Police Department.
Turku police are wondering why the city is the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bicycles have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft may be affected by how much bicycles are moved around in the city and how many bicycles there are at all", reflects Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, of the Police Department, is quite expecting Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to come out on top in the comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely depends on which are the study and cycling cities.
The market is crowded, short distances and plenty of bicycles for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a very different type of city, with city centres far apart and the bicycle not necessarily the primary means of transport", says Reen.
In Finland as a whole, police have been informed of slightly fewer bike thefts in January-August than in the same period last year.
But there's no reason to be too happy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts each year.
That means 50 to 60 fillers a day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They are large numbers", says Reen.
In reality, the thieves take more bikes, since only a small percentage of victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bicycle theft, even though less than one in ten cases reported to the police are solved.
The typical solved bike theft is one where the police get the information about the theft right away and the thief gets caught in the act.
"There are cases that are also revealed in other investigations, such as when a drug case involves the finding of stolen bicycles in an apartment", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week either in the act or in the course of a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that bicycles are stolen from shopping malls, from their shelves, from their courtyards, from warehouses and from bicycle basements, or from virtually anywhere they are usually stored.
Of the individual models of bicycles, the most stolen are Jopo, as in previous years.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term personal use, for example, but a large proportion of the stolen bicycles end up being sold, for example, through the Internet.
They're going to stay in the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been aware that the majority of the stolen bicycles go abroad", says Reen.
The police say the buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, as he may be guilty of concealment or misconduct.
"Alarms should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear discount", says Reen.
Severi Hirvi, a special librarian, always carries his colorful Nopsa during his working days under the protection of the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He has had five bicycles, but none have been stolen, Hirvi says. "Never taken, so it's been a good monk".
"Maybe this is not so attractive to thieves, it may not be hipster-worthy", thinks Hirvi from Helsinki.
At a kiosk in Helsinki's Kallio district, Siiri Valve, acting quickly, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the wheel is banging against the wall of the kiosk, but normally Valve locks its bike in something solid, like a bicycle rack.
"It's going to take a lot of thinking, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own", says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, which cost about $500 (U.S.) for the body alone.
"All the time, I hear from my friends that the bikes have been stolen".
"To pick up bad wheels, like the J-Dogs".
Valve himself was robbed of a bicycle in the backyard of a housing company a year ago.
The bike was unlocked, so Valve was waiting to steal it.
Under 15s for their crimes?
Helsinki tries out the US-known peer-review panels
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
Initially, the experiment will be applied to those under 15 years of age, who will now be exempt from criminal liability.
A jury of his peers will intervene at the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that a jury of peers discuss what happened with the perpetrator and then decide on a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator himself may join a jury of his peers to atone for his actions.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
The youth director, Tommi Laitio, says the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All of them are directing young people's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake", says Laitio.
The peer review panel is modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after a first offense, a teenager does not have to face an adult panel, but instead reflects on what happened with people of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a Palmu service designer who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully resolved.
Especially for first offences committed by minors under the age of 15, they may not have been prosecuted at all.
"It has been a message to keep going down the path you have chosen", Lovio says.
The jury is part of the Helsinki Youth for Immigrants project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
Over 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, which had received it to see a draft.
According to the paper, an open letter has been sent to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the dissent caused by Donald Trump, along with his indifference, incompetence and record unpopularity, threatens to bring a vote-riot to the Democrats in this election", the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all possible funds to congressional elections immediately can keep Republicans from drowning the Trump-ornamented anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing by the day.
Politico says the letter is scheduled to be sent within the next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is apparently Trump's anti-Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
Moreover, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working for national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief to families with children in the US
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy Thursday night.
I'm running for president so the American economy can be a success for all.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make sure the economy is doing well for him and his friends", Clinton said in her speech.
At the heart of the Clinton plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve America's infrastructure - roads, bridges, airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases from the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a helping hand to American workers who suffer from the factories moving to low-wage countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We're building time, we have to get back to building!
Clinton said it.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the burden on working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, by the way, when he said that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax haven, it has to pay the exit tax, Clinton said.
Now he's opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"[As president] I will oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
Speculation in The Washington Post before Clinton's speech suggested that Clinton was going to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic program, which was unveiled on Monday, for "favoring only millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed massive corporate tax cut has been described by Clinton as "Trump's piggy bank".
On Thursday, Clinton emphasized that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of the small business owners whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton whispered.
This is the audience in Rio: The competition has not glued Finns to the edge of the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports events appear in television viewing figures as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached a record audience.
At best, 12 per cent of the population have been caught up in the races: the Tuesday night swim was watched by 615 000 people on the YLE Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By way of comparison, the European Championships in general sports a month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers at a time on TV2, and the European Championships in football a whopping 2 million.
The most interesting of the Olympic Games so far has been the Sunday night cycling and the opening day gymnastics, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers on the Olympic Channel.
The general sports chief, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the number of spectators, recalling that for the first time at the Rio Olympics, spectators will be divided into several different equipment.
In addition to television, Finns are watching the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased that a large proportion of television viewers are choosing the Olympics.
On the television side, viewers are split between TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports events to have a full channel dedicated to them.
When you're on the air 24 hours a day, and you're watching 20,000 to 500,000 people all the time, that's a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than the 2012 London Olympics or the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large proportion of the Rio Olympics broadcasts come to Finland at night.
The second reason for the lack of interest - if anyone considers it to be - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had won a surprise medal at the preliminary games, interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, general sports are just beginning, as are other sports that interest Finns: sailing and horse riding.
Initial ratings have been close to what Pokki said they expected.
When the sporting world starts, the ratings will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd wager we're already at 200,000 downloads.
"We'll have the online viewership figures later", Pokkinen says.
The Rio Arena has not worked out as well as we would have liked for all the users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come in and the flaws have been fixed.
There has been a delay in the opening of the Rio Arena and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been released, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen on the Yule Canal and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some sports, and on radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most labor-intensive ever for the U.S. but also the last to be watched only from the U.S. channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports are shown on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is 95.3 metres deep at Ristinsel.
It could be deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a weight of about 20 square meters on the Ristis, the depth of which the dive computer showed to be 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to confirm the finding by sounding a bell, but failed.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 m) and Lake Suvas (90 m).
The maximum depth is 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as thoroughly as the Sun.
The bottom of Lake Inari, in particular, has not been thoroughly mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths", Kannela reflects.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is the Great Volcanic Lake, 23 meters.
In this way, your Sun is not among the ten deepest, and the Saltwater is even further from the top.
Correction August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in the middle were wrong.
The tax base: taxation of pensioners even tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the problem came up during the parliamentary elections and that pensioners were promised equal taxation with regard to their salaries.
The government's proposal does not contain any of this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be able to be kept after the elections, he tells Western media.
Earlier this year, wage earners received a reduction in earnings, which eased taxation.
The issue was heated by opposition members in Parliament, who chided then-Finance Minister Alexander Stubb for his election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, not increased.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following categories of taxation:
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment, if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo about the desire to honour the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It is a result of the efforts of the social partners, and it should not be undermined by questioning it.
It is necessary because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
Long-term unemployment contagious in the country
I think that the Commission should be able to make a decision on this matter.
The number of longterm unemployed in June was about 17 000 more than a year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will fall through.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand, at least four people were killed in bomb attacks last night and last night, Finnish time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season to Thailand is at the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has been trying to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular to get information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No word on the perpetrator .
Westphalen says the perpetrator of the attacks is still unknown.
The ambassador suspects that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country for protesting against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict is also raging over the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, in the past, strikes have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
He says the town is celebrating the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The strikes affect the course of the day in a way that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police: Strikes are not about international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and were different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police, according to the AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have been killed in 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including in the tourist hotspots of Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the popular tourist destination of the Finnish island of Phuket, four bombs exploded overnight, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
In a popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, a total of four bombs exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
In both double bombings, at least one person was killed.
In addition, in the village of Surat Than and the town of Trang in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person was killed in each attack.
Many tourists also know Surat Thani, which leads to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the ruling military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is still unknown.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We must not incite people to panic any further, he told reporters.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators' intention was to destroy the country's tourism industry, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Europeans wounded
Very little is known about the nighttime attacks in Finland and their victims.
We've had some more information about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians are among the wounded.
Hua Hin's latest attack wounded at least three people.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the famous clock tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have sealed off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found one more bomb.
The governor of Surat Thani said the bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
The strike killed a city employee.
There's at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which went off about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded outside two different police stations.
The U.S. Biles won the women's quadruple sculls.
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the Olympic titles in Rio in the long jump, pole vault and pom-poms.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics quite a bit over the last few years.
He's got eight individual world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the quadruple sculls and the permafrost championships three times in a row and the pomme last year and the second year.
With the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The Biles have some pretty cool World Cup medals for jumping and pumping.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Iskus has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's playground on the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more strikes, I don't think anything more wonderful will follow, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur, he has seen many of the tragedies that have befallen Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was the bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these guys haven't been kicking tourists out before, I don't think this one will either.
The office of the Hoovilla company is located a few hundred yards from the blast site.
The Hoovil heard about the attack from one of their own employees.
The employee called at about nine o'clock local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the strikes.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the road signs were put up for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to the Friday holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere at Patong was calm, and the main street was allowed to open at about 10:00 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had never even heard of the attacks.
By 3:30 p.m. Thai time, traffic in Patong was normal and many shops had opened.
Based on the impact site, the blast was fairly small, says Huovila, who was at the scene.
Later, the car was seen in the Crown Estate on Jouxholmin Road.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
Patrol spotted two men matching the identification marks hiding in a nearby hamlet.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of motor vehicle, theft and gross damage.
The police are grateful for the clues.
The Director of Research on the Russian leadership changes: Clear sideline
Russia's highest-ranking leadership changed on Friday after President Vladimir Putin fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44, of Estonian descent.
He's an ex-diplomat and he was Ivanov's second in command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the powerful people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the reversal of executive positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from taking power for themselves, independent of the president.
The fabric also suggests that Ivanov may have gotten into a fight with other senior executives or screwed up.
The fall of Ivanov
Ivanov, a Putin insider, will move to the special task force on environment and transport.
In a video released by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred and suggested that Peresko be replaced, Russia Today reported.
Mr. Kangaspuro says from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear loss of position.
Environment and transport are not very high on the order of priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has been a key member of the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the Soviet Union, in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but was succeeded by Dmitri Medvedev.
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the EU's financial markets.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's seat is that Putin is changing his inner circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields in their retreat in Syria .
They used civilians as human shields when fleeing to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars and taken to Jarablus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters last week captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
But it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected from earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact ISIS fighters were abducting civilians as they fled the city.
The Ministry of Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior refused to release the list of participants in the events of the Minister of Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the Cabinet and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's communications director tells STT that the Ministry has seen a need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic appearance begins in Rio
As in years past, Bolt has been running out of time under the price tag.
He injured his ankle early in the season and missed the Jamaican Olympic trials.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better shape.
I've been training well and that's the key, Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press event included a few striptease dancers and reporters turned fans.
The noise around Bolt underscores the rise of the Jamaican star in an era when all-around sport has struggled with doping scandals and rising interest.
Bolt's previous Olympic defeat came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the preliminary round of the 200 meters in a time of 21.05.
Bolt, then 17, was a young prospect, slowed by injuries and a loose training posture.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at the 100 meters, where he broke the world record and the confidence of the competitors despite the final parade with a time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the top of his career by a clock.
The world records set in Berlin at 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his goal of breaking the 200-meter world record and breaking 19 seconds, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
The 100m's biggest challenger is Justin Gatlin, the winner of the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
Last year in the final of the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt hasn't lost a single grand final in his tenure in Beijing, if he's ever been able to get on the field.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was cancelled by Bolt due to a fraudulent source.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's game, and the Rio Olympics are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the goal line for next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart from the rest.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself, this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in a Sports Illustrated interview.
Rio revelations: two athletes suspected of doping violations
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese drug dealer Chen Xiny's doping sample showed traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian athlete Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping violations.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic trainer was sent home for giving a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given us a doping sample with evidence of epo-hormone.
She placed fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estado, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample of Xiny's blood samples from Sunday's test showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have been other suspected doping incidents in Rio.
The BBC has reported that Bulgarian female sprinter Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample containing evidence of epo-hormone.
Kenya, meanwhile, has been sent to Rio to the home of the athletic trainer for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that a Kenyan coach had impersonated an athlete during the test and had given a doping test to prove it.
According to media reports, the suspect is Kenyan sprinting coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the safety belt of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps will stop at nothing . Historic gold has come to the showroom .
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam the 200-meter medley in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
Phelps was the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the same event in four consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan placed second in the mixing before Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and the BBC's Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with the Evening Post.
The story about Helen Skelton (O.K.) on Monday is one of the most read stories on the Evening Post website this week.
Next to me is the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get much stress if there's a little fuss in the press or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
After all, television is a visual medium, he insists.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a short dress, which is certainly at least sufficiently revealing - at least in the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
But there is no backward step.
It's important to look good, and small boobs are just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to tone down and maybe even shock, but he insists he doesn't want to be the lead.
He says, "This isn't about me.
We're here to watch a sport, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the boom has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that puts the spotlight on how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how big the sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton grins.
You know what, man?
It's a thing of the past when it comes to the way the presenter dresses.
I'm a little amused if this has hit anyone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests on terrorism charges.
Rio police announced Thursday that they have arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made the arrests during the security surveillance of the games.
The police made five other arrests in connection with the same incident and interrogated two persons before releasing them.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news website, the individuals arrested for terrorism are part of the same group whose members were arrested by police in July.
The suspects are believed to have links to the Islamic State group.
The arrested were known to have incited violence on social media.
In the past, the group has been involved in the campaign against the death penalty.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Olympics.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio.

The crowd was allowed in after the police had controlled the detonation of the package.
The crowd did not arrive in the theater by the time the game started because the police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and only then did they allow the public into the hall.
The drink woke the Spanish team, who had started the race in a sleepy manner.
Spain, who started the tournament with two defeats, beat Nigeria 96-87.

Argentinian lady beat up the Cheating Siren - Finnish thought protest
The wind at the Cheating Sirens was a colorful day at the Rio de Janeiro competition.
The winds in the Cheater Mountain were pretty rough Thursday.
The Argentine lady wore the Wind-Treater Siren on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted to the violation.
He was stuck in the crash, and the others ran away, said Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland.
The athlete considered protesting for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing because it would have been useless according to Olympic rules.
"I should have fallen into the water to be repaid", said the Cheating Siren.
The Finn hung on his board until the end because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn was 27th when he started.
In the overall standings, the 2012 London Olympics silver medalist is eighth.
The crash didn't do much for the skull.
Friday is a big day, with the race from 10 to 12.
Modified 0.39: Contrary to initial reports, the Cheating Siren did not protest.
7 weird things that science says will prolong your life
Science has explored everything possible between earth and sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some of these are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health, prolonging his life.
On the other hand, sometimes things beyond a person's control can add years to his life.
These include the tendency to be overweight or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't always have to do the trick. Just get the milk carton.
Many studies have been conducted to uncover the secret of longevity.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest findings.
Science says that all of these things can add years to your life.
Drinking Beer and Coffee
Drinking coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A Harvard study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death", especially in neurological or cardiac diseases.
In favor of alcohol, studies show that moderate consumption - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one study found that people who drank wine lived longer than people who drank none at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can extend a person's life by as much as six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents the development of sinus infections.
In turn, they can contribute to the spread of other diseases in other parts of the human body.
A study in Norway found that laughter affected the length of a person's life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive the experiment than those who laughed less.
Sex, when it is associated with protection against STDs, is shown by many studies to be beneficial to health.
More than that, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
To add years to a person's life, he must also have an orgasm.
Exercise is a lifetime, there's no denying that.
But achieving longevity does not require absolute sobriety.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to low-fat mortality.
Whether an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than the average man.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, doubt that longevity is due to a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible for him to achieve such accolades as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behavior of people over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily is less likely to be a shopping parent.
This is because walking around in shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause premature death.
So, count the credit card from your hand - so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A drunk driver with a bad temper slid into a truck.
A serious collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Koske, Finland, on Friday evening.
The accident happened in Kosk, between Koskenti and Sorvastonti on Friday at 9pm.
The truck had been heading towards Forssa when the passenger car encountered had driven into the same lane, hitting the truck at the right angle.
The truck was left in the lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
A van slid into a ditch and then went over the ditch to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 driving a passenger car was crushed in her car.
The rescue team detached the injured driver from the car and transported him to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
She had a breath test of 2.02 per milliliters.
He's on suspicion of gross DUI.
The post office sent the candy bars to the wrong city.
The Salon K-Citymarket's range of unbleached candies was deficient because the post office had delivered part of the cargo to Seinäjoki by accident.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernio, was buying candy at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when she saw a funny sign.
Unfortunately, the unloading forms are defective because the Post Office delivered our shipment to Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post gets the shipment!
So unless there's a traffic jam in the lawn mower, the sign says,
The sign on the shop window is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
The Post will be offering lawn mowers until the end of August.
Elti thought the sign was mostly funny, and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update knocked me out.
The media has been calling all the time, and the attention this has attracted is incredible, Halti wonders.
By Friday night, the Haltia update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
The Elf got his own favorite to be caught in a bag of chocolates, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the transport services business of the Post Office, expressed his regret at the loss to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were lost yesterday in the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we did not go to do the submission (Saloon) with three, but we took five stages only today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first news story was in the Evening News.
Mr. Elt didn't mind the sign, because he found all his own free-range confectionery in the pantry.
Lotta Backlund, who lost 30 pounds, posted a picture of her transformation.
A comedy producer has lost a ton of weight since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of her life-changing experience.
Lotta shared a couple of photos of her transformation on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness regimen, aiming for a normal weight.
The Backlund lot in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss career back in 2009.
He's made a complete lifestyle change and has quietly lost a little over 100 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
The Backlund before and after photographs have garnered a number of compliments from national conciliators.
You are amazing.
We're on the same path, motivation is strong!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
Your pictures give me tremendous strength and passion, when I'm in heaven myself on the same journey, told by another.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last of her weight on the Do It Now project.
At that time he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which at the time was about ten kilograms.
After three months of exercise, I lost five pounds.
The family of a woman murdered in the Lowice: memories of the victim for the police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa last week hopes that instead of flowers and addresses, the victim will be remembered by a donation to the police dog charity.
The Sipoon Veterinary Hospital has posted a Facebook post, in which it shares the victim's family's wish for donations for the police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinary Hospital and had also completed her nursing internship there.
The vet's office remembers her in touching words.
Cheerful, smart, with a sense of humor and no fear of work.
My good friend.
We still can't fully comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money will go entirely to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of security dogs.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors have told the Evening Standard that the victim was a very animal-loving man.
He owned a number of animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a hen.
The 27-year-old suspect in the murder didn't know the woman, and they had no connection.
The killer's tracking included a police dog named Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal ruled against Post for breach of the Equality Act
The Postal Service had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to inform the hired worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court ruled in its judgment.
The Court of Appeal ordered Post to pay the employee the majority of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the apprentice's salary which corresponded to the apprentice's share of the whole day's work.
The Court of Appeal held that the employee had been placed at a disadvantage by reason of his trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The worker had complied with the organisation decision of the PAU, the Postal and Logistics Union, prohibiting him from making inquiries.
During the postal strike last November, the PAU made a decision that postal workers would not be interviewed for hired workers who broke the strike.
The People's News first reported the incident.
Turkey must return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) wrote in their reply to the Journalists' Union.
The European Union is committed to the implementation of the UN Charter on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The Union of Journalists had earlier asked Sipil and Soini in a letter to express their concern about freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly stressed the importance of freedom of the press and expression in Turkey.
Putin replaced his administration with the head of the Estonian-style Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He is replaced by Anton Vaino, the grandson of Soviet Communist leader Karl Vaino.
He is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution also includes a member of Russia's Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a close associate of Putin, will be transferred to the special task force on environment and transport, according to a Kremlin statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other roles and suggested that Peresko be replaced, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB's espionage.
Many people considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
ManU 's giant bid for the game ban will not be seen at the opening of the Valioliiga
The world record holder in transfer fees will not be seen on the field as the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed his trip to England.
Manchester United giant Paul Pogba is out of action for the game as ManU opens their season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba to Juventus, the Italian side, for €105 million, according to British media.
However, the FA has kept him out of the game, as Pogba has been burdened with a suspension from Juventus.
He got two warnings at the Italian Cup last season, and that's a one-game suspension.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next game is in the second round of the league on August 19th, when ManU will face Southampton.
At Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The strict criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have cemented Flow Festival's status as an internationally acclaimed event targeted by the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival starts in Helsinki on Friday.
The partygoers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the top artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival's event area is decorated with, among other things, artificial turf and art installations.
"We've never had enough of just having a main stage and a beer tent", says artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which takes place this weekend in Helsinki's Summer Garden, has grown from a small street festival to an event with tens of thousands of visitors.
The success of the event is based on a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves like to attend?
It's kind of weird in event production to think like this.
The aim is often to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the authorities' orders, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 from last year's 70,000.
This year, the festival will again feature a number of interesting local and international artists.
The increase in the number of visits is a good thing, because there is a way to finance what is being done.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too big, because at some point the mass will be like a cattle train being driven along huge paths.
We don't want that.
The ideology of the successful event has been expanded over the past 13 years to include 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars, partly decorated with artifacts.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year's venue will be a 15,000-person tent.
Kallio admits that the event could be done in a simpler way.
I may be a bit of a bigot, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve the spirit of Flow.
If we lose it, this is no longer our business.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio is that even grand visions are now practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, its operation was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of around EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the public limited company operating Flow was about EUR 6 million.
It can be used to do "circular things", such as building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's guests have typically expressed themselves in distinctive attire.
In addition to the music scene, there is a trendy young adult community.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out above all else because of the content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit into Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
One of the top artists this year is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his genre, but he's not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop, rap and soul.
Kallio says Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he'll be seen on tour in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggie's latest record is damn good, and he's done some damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs were hidden in flower pots in Thailand 's tourist paradise . The tourists fled in terror .
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night local time.
The attack killed at least one local woman and injured more than 20.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bomb was planted on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
The blasts occurred as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who lives in Asia, tweeted a picture that spoke volumes about the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet properly, you can look it up here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People came running to me and said that a bomb had gone off outside the bar.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thanh.
At least one died.
The number of casualties is not yet known.
Soon afterward, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is also popular with Finns.
As far as we know, no one died.
At the same time, another double bombing took place in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
And there was a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet detonated.
Thai authorities say the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are dissatisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that there may also be criminal organizations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently been caught up in the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
This section of the newly formed reserve forces will go into battle first in a war situation .
In an acute war situation, the soldiers are ordered to combat duties only several months after taking the oath of allegiance, reports Central Finnish.
For example, according to the Defense Forces' training officer, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnisen, interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are fit to fight in the military service for 5.5 months.
According to the training commander, the first to be assigned are the reservists in the readiness forces.
No Marine or reservist is ordered to a mission without the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin training servicemen for immediate readiness units starting next year.
The units may be used in combat operations as required during the course of their training.
Pamela Tola got a huge settlement for the homeless .
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a bitter dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of the two-storey detached house was EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, causing a health-threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a scrap in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in a financial loss for Tola and Waroma of up to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court, where they demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the plaintiff's court and the court of the court.
The court of appeals ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the seller to pay a price reduction of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the couple's proceedings and settlement, totalling EUR 47 344.
The Court moderated the price reduction slightly because the buyers had already known at the time of the sale that some of the apartment was in need of repair.
However, the Court found that the defects were substantially more serious than had been alleged.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a good home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was in good repair and in good condition and that the details mentioned in the inspection report were not a problem.
The inspection report cited as risks and disadvantages ventilation and the inadequate management of rain and meltwater runoff along the cliff face.
However, the discussions did not reveal any urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that perhaps within a few years the rainwater from the rock would need to be controlled a little.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than previously thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which witnesses said was caused by both the rainwater from the rock and the capillary soil.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that air contaminated with microbes could also enter the interior through the porch.
The health risk-positive excess levels of yeast or yeast were found in the household cleaning room, basement stairwell, living room window drawer and basement laundry room.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The Court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the house had been altered without permission before the sale.
The terraces, for example, had been built, although the proper permits were not yet available.
But the gay issues were the heart of the courtroom.
According to the Court, the purchasers could have assumed, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living in and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
In the case of Tola and Waroma, the Court of First Instance did not consider that there was any particular reason for carrying out the usual wider inspection.
The buyers have not breached their duty to dispense, the court finds in its judgment.
Scary archive find: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - Finnish women also in the register
In a recent article in Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilmed documents of a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns, and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi masons.
The documents and registration cards are from the racial bureau that operated in Nazi Germany.
The Racial Bureau operated under the direction of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more so for women who were expected to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women were given gynecological tests to find out.
The Bureau of Race Research investigated the women's backgrounds, including church records.
The idea was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also required to be willing to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to provide the race bureau with handwritten biographies and good references from relatives.
The race bureau wanted to guarantee that the women were "child-loving", "saving", and "good National Socialists" who spoke German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either within or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, reports the website of the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidies to help people have children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" were forbidden by law, the museum's website states.
The sixth of the Traitor-Sire, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the first day's sail for the Finns at the Rio Olympics, but was left as the tail end of the whole group in the second day's sail.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th.
The Wind Cheater Siren fought off the RS-X class of the day, 17th and 3rd.
In the overall standings, Cheating Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening race of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are 19th.
The Satulinna of Jari Bridge was recorded in a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so in a coma"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite artists in Finland for over 20 years.
From cruise ship bartender to 1995 tango king, Finland's best-selling solo artist and star of dance clubs and festivals, Sillanpää is still able to thrive and is currently on a wild rise.
The book about the life of the favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Naked, written by Mari Koppinen, was published today, Thursday.
In this book, Bridgehead tells the story of his life and career, for better or worse.
His career took a total upswing when he won the crown of the King of the Tango at the Seinäjoen Tango Market in 1995.
At the competition, Bridgehead sang tangos, but he had already planned a slightly different kind of music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for the bridge at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book says that the recording did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead recorded it in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so pissed!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that has become a huge hit would not immediately be thought to have been sung in a hunger-stroke.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't always have to be perfect and top notch.
The second incident related to his favorite songs, as described in the book, occurred nearly two decades later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with her then-partner and the case eventually ended up with the lyrics of the song "You Deserve Gold", which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmä were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Bridgehead had imagined that he was making an album that told the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the break-up were not true, but it was based on a news story in the magazine 7 Days.
The newspaper story said that Jari's ex-lover had broken up with him because of his excessive partying and alcohol abuse, but Jari said that it was a complete and untrue lie.
Jari called the record company in anger about the book and refused to sing the song, but eventually did.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting to leave the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted to leave and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although opinion polls during the week of the vote predicted the opposite.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support for staying in the EU.
No reputable research institute or university supported the distinction, although a few individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign of the founder of Western politics, former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", was scrapped in the UK Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
From the economic slang
The Centre for Macroeconomics is conducting its latest monthly survey of the professional community's responses to the Brexit catastrophe.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic status by economists is that people don't understand economics.
Many people still believe that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, that is, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the realm of British.
Many people also feel that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it would promote export industries.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy felt that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly irritated by the BBC's impartiality, which gave as much space to the few per cent of economists who supported the EU's separation as to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in reporting the views of the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic giants on the consequences of the split.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, public debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were not given any consideration, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not feel they have a common interest.
While academics in big cities, such as economists, would have stayed in the EU, the message in small towns and rural areas was not effective.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming winning argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant clogs your hospital, an immigrant exploits you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
You can see immigrants in every health center waiting room.
How much easier would it be for a British to get medical care if there were none?
Every school has immigrant kids.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place at school if they were thrown out?
Every municipality has foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But economists failed to answer them, and if they did, their answers did not gain any visibility.
Economists have failed to explain why immigration is giving Britons more jobs, fewer health care bills, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU immigrants in particular - are net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen 's housing fund has been prepared for Brexit with cash .
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
He said that in Aberdeen, they prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan B, the pro-secession camp, was being prepared for a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a tie.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have measurable liquid assets, but they may be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily, quoted real estate fund that the news touched on.
The old lady said the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest of the nine open-ended real estate funds, Vanhanen says, of all the open-ended real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest cash in these funds was 10 percent or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with a very different strategy.
The funds closed trading
When the pro-secession camp won, Europe was in disarray.
However, the real estate market was relatively calm in the less than two weeks following the vote, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed everything.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, where he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial property operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they took the situation by storm and made headlines in the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared with 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowballs started to roll, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash it had accumulated, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually close down the trade, but they changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worthwhile to panic-pull the money out.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation down, and most of them pulled the call.
Since then, the market has been fairly flat, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks, says Old.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in Aberdeen's mainland European funds.
But there were a lot of inquiries.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
The old man felt that the closures of real estate funds had received excessive attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control about 4% of UK property.
The Aberdeen closure lasted six days, and the company sold off less than 10 of its 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it may hold onto its funds for the first half of 2017.
There is uncertainty at the moment and economic growth forecasts have been slashed, but the situation does not look 'worse' for Aberdeen.
The major questions now are about the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even opened up new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen notes.
The pound and dollar are at their weakest level in 30 years, and the market is down 15% on the pre-Brexit period.
A buyer of one dollar can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
There's a lot of buyers willing, Old Man says.
Brexit has brought downside effects to London's housing market
At 2:00 a.m., things didn't look so bad.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investment at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's what you're thinking.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, says the old man in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the dawn.
The news was broadcast on the normally silent television screens in the office, and the normally noisy crowd paused to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the showpieces were all red.
It was a morning I never thought I'd live, says the Old Man.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was mixed.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and so the situation was somewhat calm, Olden says.
The Brexit vote started a corrective movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market was beginning to anticipate severe losses in the UK and particularly in London.
In London, office space was projected to suffer a 20% decline in the coming years.
Soon a number of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the poison has subsided, but the air is still uncertain.
It is not, however, to be seen on the face of the old man who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He said it was too early to say much about what Brexit would bring.
So much remains to be seen: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial information on developments in the London housing market has already been received.
The price data of CBRE, a real estate services company, cover about one third of the market.
They found that all London property prices fell by 3.3 percent from June to July.
In the City of London, the number of office buildings affected by the mine rose by 6.1%, Olden lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly.
The monthly index was launched in 1987 and only five months have had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the similarly large declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting because Brexit was compared rather quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began with the U.S. housing market.
The old man feels that the comparison is not quite right, for now it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The tunnel is another.
The real estate market has not seen the panic sales of that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
And the financing is normally available.
The repair move could have been coming anyway .
In fact, he is not surprised by the price adjustment movement - one that could have been in the offing without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other major cities around the world have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years now that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced, says Old Man.
So the fall started from a very high place.
London's prices have been climbing for four reasons, the Old Man's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has London's population.
The second big trend is that real estate is the last property to go global, says Vanhanen.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutional and private investors are looking for real estate investment abroad.
London is known as a city, an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have led pension companies, for example, to seek revenue from new items.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhaas, the use of debt leverage is now much lower than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
♪ Spread it out, spread it out ♪
In London, prices have been flat last summer, Old Man tells us.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten its holdings in London, and last year it was a net seller.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the old man.
He is afraid to say much, but he says there is little prospect of a rise.
The mood indicates that there is a downward or even motion ahead.
The old man has already seen several ups and downs, having been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that work is the way out.
If you're prepared to take risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you've diversified, you've diversified your risks, says the Old Man.
S-Group starts recording purchases more accurately than before
Soon, S-Group will know what you're eating, because the retail group said today that they're starting to collect more accurate data on their regular customers' purchases.
By the end of May, once the final amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will also start to collect it from the products purchased.
Group S is following Kesko in this respect, as the data on goods purchased with the plus card have been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific data is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes under licence.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
"Very few customers have refused to use product information", Riitala told Economist.
According to him, Kesko has no intention of reacting to the change in the registration of Group S.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into 10 groups based on the mere purchase of food.
The ranking is updated monthly.
The classification of the customers is also based on the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing.
The data on purchases at the point of production are collected only from the K Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a permanent customer programme and no such programme is currently planned.
Finnish retailers have their own Single Bonus customer programme, which can be accessed at the Votilatalo, Sivo and Euromarkete.
We do not currently collect data at product or product group level, we will stick to the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and the day and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not reached the level of the K-group or the S-group, says Anu Ora, commercial director.
He said that the fixed customer programme was to be revised in the future, but that the Commission would give further details.
However, Ora does not promise that the registration of product information will be initiated.
First, the experiment.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data included occupation, education, residence, years of birth of children and previous personal data.
The persons belonging to the same economic activity and their roles are also registered.
The S-Card purchase records the date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of the purchase and the method of payment.
In addition, the S-bonus partners have received information from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, the data are recorded at the level of the product group for the time being.
The customers have long been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of customer ownership and partnering at SOK.
S-Group says they'll notify their clients of the change.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
But the data is stored in the registers, whether you want it or not.
The applicant may check the information stored on the S Group website.
For example, the cash registers cannot access the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is the newest dog to be confirmed by Tull - puppy will be the first explosion dog
The black Labrador cub is eagerly sniffing at five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It doesn't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila by playing with his favorite toy.
A can of gunpowder-scented shells was found in the drawer next to which Heila was sitting.
The powder gas is the first smell that Heila has been trained on, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and reasons for access to online shopping
Heila is the first dog trained by Tull to search for weapons and explosives and will be stationed at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may take Heila and Sunto to other border crossing points and ports as necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks prompted action at customs and the monitoring has been strengthened since the attacks, says Mikko Grönberg, the customs chief inspector.
Another way to train a gun and explosives dog for customs duties is through the postal consignments that pass through Helsinki Airport.
The airport is also home to a number of international airports, including the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, and the airport of Frankfurt am Main.
In recent years, customs has made a finding at Helsinki Airport involving some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their starting materials, among online purchases, passenger luggage and air cargo.
Heila will be working at different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be checking all registered baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great use in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether further training of gun and explosive dogs will be provided in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School With a Church Name
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tully Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also trains with Heila with police and Defense Forces experts.
The police have extensive experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have extensive experience in explosives.
Customs, in conjunction with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always given further training as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs from Tull and a money and drug dog, Massi.
Labrador Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog to call at the airport include agility and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, since the dog is exposed to weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's house, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing gets home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Heila's getting subtle orders from the double-dealer.
The cameraman of the Evening News loses the camera's mic cover to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-like cover at the "turn" command.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's graduating from elementary school next year.
There are still a number of tests to be carried out in October to assess whether the training is adequate for the demanding job.
Heila can be seen on duty at Helsinki Airport in the second half of next year, if all goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to pet a dog in a work vest, Suntio reminds us.
The cost to customs of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
They are active for about seven or eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work periods last only from ten minutes to a few hours.
There's a lot of competition for working dogs in Customs.
Heila's been applying for the job of a customs officer.
Luckily for Suntie, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory duties at Tull.
The mini-state won its first Olympic medal . The people get a day off .
With a population of less than a million, Fiji's Olympic rugby is so highly regarded that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the case after the championship was settled.
The day after the team's homecoming, the day off.
The hero team is also being celebrated in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the final in the capital Suva, where a screen was installed in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering, Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish actor fainted after a gruesome performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard-fought fight at 175 kg.
The tocola has a special and lethal lifting property.
During or immediately after the heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one's really been able to tell me why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 pounds from pushing and 145 pounds from grabbing.
His combined score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his job with his last 175 kilos, as well as his second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose to the tune of a wild roar.
His body was shaking under the weight of the gun, until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish swimmer was happy to know that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired the Estonian striker Prosa from the Vetting League.
The Rovaniemi Football Association, a football club playing in the men's football league, has signed a contract with the Estonian striker Albert Prosa for the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with a lot of potential and a very small chance of coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with over 10 players' agents.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, joins RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoen, where the rovani meets the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's painting king, Alexander Kokko, moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star is back in the spotlight: the teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as the "gentle Alex Dunphy" of the "Modern Family" sitcom, is once again showing off her formidable body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts not only revealed the actor's legs, but also his ass.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to be considerably bolder.
The star has posed in pictures posted on social media in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing extremely tight suits.
Winter, now on the verge of adulthood, has also recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you can't see it, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
At this point, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood makeover" from child star to adult.
She's been on television for most of her life, and she grew up with the Kardashians.
He's learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on Modern Family when she was only 11.
The actor has upset some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where he'll be in ten years, with the recession already so bad, says one woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, however, defend the actress and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone says.
You're an inspiration to many women, a radiant young woman.
Japanese prefer Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the windmill: in autumn it is possible to see the fairy-tale mirror aurora
The campaign aims to attract Japanese tourists to start their excursions from the very beginning, says Visit Finland in a press release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for Japanese tourism.
The lights of Revon are the hallmarks of our winter travels, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and the snowy landscape.
There is a great demand for winter trips to Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales of trips in the autumn.
Few people know that the spring flowering season begins in early autumn and continues into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake surface reflects the edges, making the view twice as bright, says Anne Lind, marketing manager for Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's revitalization campaign is aimed primarily at wealthy, urban Japanese women aged 25-35, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
The tourist attraction in Finland is, among other things, through online advertising.
A survey carried out by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo shows that Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need more clear-cut, unique sights from Finland, and this is a region with huge potential, according to Lind.
The number of overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much time in Finland as they did in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for tourism in Finland, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in the Rugby 7 competition, with Fiji's champions winning gold
Britain's impressive success in the seven-man rugby competition was crushed when Fiji beat it in the final at Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday by 43-7.
Fiji followed the teachings of the champions in ball handling, passing, side-scoring, backhanded, running and cruising, winning gold - if not the first Olympic medal in its history.
The loss was silver, a slightly more than consolation for Britain, which won its third silver on the same day, and can be proud of its success in the first ever Olympic rugby sevens tournament, where it beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tight win by South Africa Boxing in the 75 semi-final earlier in the day could have a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fiji team in this form would have beaten the British, even if the 15-man squad had been at full strength.
It may be a consolation for the UK that at least one Briton will be awarded a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, a former England rugby sevens coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost every game under Ryan's coaching at the Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
The loss is painful, but the progress is staggering.
Fidzi started out brilliantly and showed off his tackling skills to the British as if for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had crashed into a crowd of moving buses, and the world champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a corner jump.
With four minutes to go, Jerry Tuwai scored the second goal on a right-handed goal kick.
It was 120, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle prevented the stunning Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it did not slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, after which Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored the second goal from the second half with over a minute remaining in the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou leapt through the more weakly-built tackles of the Great Britain team and jumped over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended at 29-0
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play rugby for seven, while the British were still in the sport as apprentices.
Which is pretty much true.
Great Britain made extensive changes at half-time and managed to hold the Fijians for a total of four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team play of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation down to 36-7 by scoring for Great Britain in the left corner, but the game was long lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the audience.
Fiji's pure, cheerful attitude was hard to ignore.
Mata Viliame finished the game with a goal in the last minute.
The horn rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan in the semi-final by 205 and Great Britain had been edged out by South Africa in a tight semi-final, with a draw decided by a British goal kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with a stunning footwork and plunged under the scoring stick in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-man rugby union player Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the gold.
This is the most emotional gold in the history of the games.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 wins in history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
While they were two in the air, the third voice on the boat was that of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to win their second consecutive Olympic gold in women's doubles, making them the first women in British sporting history to achieve such a feat.
Their superiority was undeniable, their 39th consecutive victory and once again a record.
What we see, two great athletes on the surface of the water, like swans, doesn't quite match the nature of success.
Every hour of the day is a big crowd of helping hands, each one of whom has contributed two to one, but the most important of all is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who didn't know at the time if he would live to see this day.
Williams said it was a tough time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be removed.
If it hadn 't been for the surgery , it would have spread everywhere .
And it would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think a little bit".
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were fortunate in that Williams was able to start its off-season operations at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if that can be said at all in the circumstances of the present case.
"I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It was a motivator.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward, six, nine, 15 meters at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's where it starts.
The flock itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bit bigger".
Immediately after the victory, the duo's thoughts were with Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more normally as he tried to overcome his own unease.
Captain Stanning of Britain's Royal Artillery, who toured Afghanistan, says: "At the hour level, I've been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much".
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years, Helen and Robin's fund has been fantastic.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach".
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
The duo has found a superior rhythm that their rivals have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 metres, as the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very much caught up in the moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me".
It is very important not to run off course".
"We did well to leave, and at the same time we did not try to do anything extraordinary.
We didn't aim for the heavens today, we just wanted to do good voodoo and win the race that we did".
A twin takes a year to think about his future.
Glover is celebrating his wedding next month with Steve Backshall , a friend of the television nature show .
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on him".
"After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to come to.
This feels so much better", she says.
Iceland replaces government overthrown by Panama leaks
Iceland is holding early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters angered by the Panama leaks have been demanding since the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers exposed tax evasion by several Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned over the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The date for the elections has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the public's recent anger will affect the outcome of the fall election.
In June, the presidential elections were marked by criticism of the ruling party, and an out-of-politics candidate, Gudni Johannesson, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic about Obama being the founder of ISIS.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest major speeches.
He said he was sarcastic in suggesting that incumbent President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in the creation of the organization.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speech and demanded an apology from Trump.
"No one should ever be allowed to be commander in chief of the military who can sink to that level", Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the popular Muslim burkini swimsuit from swimming along beaches, reports Britain's Guardian newspaper.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have good manners and a secular swimsuit.
The decision also says that swimsuits that exaggerate religious affiliations may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two extremist groups linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest in his 80's.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu area was higher than the blue-water bathing water in the town of Tyykösjärv
The water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the blue-green algae has been observed on the shores of Lake Pyykös.
The Oulu Regional Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Regional Area on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The levels of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in the bathing waters of all beaches, with the exception of the beaches of the sea, were below the limits of the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The levels of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in the seafood bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green deposition observed on the swimming beach of Lake Tyko does not yet render the water unfit for swimming, but under favorable conditions it can quickly turn into a blue-green flowering, with the surface of the water forming a blue-green mass in slabs.
The Environmental Action will monitor the situation with an intensified inspection.
If the bluebell population changes to a bluebell flower, this shall also be indicated separately on the information board of the swimming pool.
Check the results of the swimming pool samples here.
The R&D&I's Hakkaryan forestry reduction: more than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest grant reduction is one of the tax changes in the Treasury's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the succession of the forestry estate.
The Ministry of Finance proposes four objectives for the reduction of forest yields: to promote the generation change of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest cover and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's objective is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct the net capital outcome of forestry.
The idea of creating such a tool to promote the generation change of forest land is good, said Juha Hakkarainen, forest director of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
But the hackers will find something to criticize about the tax reform proposal.
The forestry contribution is calculated as the net capital gain of the forest owner.
It is the capital gains minus all other deductions.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarinen, the impact of the tax reduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the income from the sale of the wood.
VM's proposal assumes that by deducting the net capital income of forestry, it is avoided that this would result in a loss of capital income of forestry which would be deducted in other taxation.
A person like that would get a tax break even if he didn't sell the wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complex.
The average forest owner is unable to grasp it, says the Hacker.
He also said that the model only affects a small percentage of forest owners.
The threshold for the tax deduction linked to the value of the forest yield is EUR 40 000.
The Hacker thinks it's been pulled too high.
As such, he says, it cuts 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the reduction circle.
The model would affect about 10 percent of the forest ownership, he says.
The WM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of breeding in the order.
In forestry policy, the decline in forest yields has been delayed for decades, according to Hakkarinen.
The reason for this is the ageing of forest ownership.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful earthquake has caught the motorists in Himanga . Two cars have slipped into a ditch and collided .
A strange back-and-forth happened on the Himanga River on Friday afternoon.
According to the emergency department, two cars in a row crashed into a ditch, after which the one behind hit the one ahead.
According to the fire chief, Harry Puyhty, the crash was believed to have been caused by a powerful earthquake.
The rear-end car had two people inside, both of whom were taken to hospital for treatment.
There's no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car in front was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalai.
A Finnish study may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku may help to develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings of the research team of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of the tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and the cells of the tissue grow normally in this environment.
Ivaska said that the cancer could be stopped from growing in the laboratory by restoring the surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue, in addition to cancer cells.
The findings are published in the August 4 issue of the respected journal of cell biology, Nature Communications.
The trial of the Muho family murder continues in the courtroom, the prosecutor demands the death sentence of the second perpetrator
The trial of the Muxo family homicide continues at court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the murder of a family pet in Muhoks.
The other was sentenced to eight years and four months for, among other things, murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The other is serving a 12-year sentence for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a juvenile.
The convicted killer was also convicted of serious road safety offences as a juvenile and of operating a vehicle while a juvenile.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who had received the harsher sentence.
The prosecution is demanding a reduced sentence for a man convicted of murder as a juvenile to 12 years in prison.
They were in complete understanding at the time of the making.
According to the district court, 17-year-old teenagers killed a man who worked as a supervisor for the school's child welfare unit last July.
The 17-year-old convicted of murder, according to the plea agreement, attacked the supervisor sitting on the back of the living room sofa.
The director had gotten out of hand and had dragged the young man into his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled with a wire, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
The psychiatric examination revealed that both of the convicts were in full consciousness at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the youths had been planning to flee the family home since at least the day before.
The world's longest-living vertebrate, the great white shark, only breeds at 156 years of age
A study published in the journal Science confirms that the ice shark is the world's longest living vertebrate.
In the North Atlantic, such as around Greenland, the ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156.
The ice shark's life span is increased by only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive the ice shark.
The scientists were able to determine the age of the stone by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950's, some sharks had radioactive residue.
From these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although the jump to one side or the other can be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump as the economic wise man
Donald Trump's America does not need to change the world.
As much as a third of all federal tax revenue would be lost if the corporate tax reform pushed by Donald Trump were implemented.
Tax revenue would also fall, particularly with tax breaks benefiting the richest.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he unveiled it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would be cut from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without it, we would be missing a very large sum of money, a billion dollars a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 percent, after the cut Trump proposed, 33.
The estate tax would be waived.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating business and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on in the past must be re-imposed and the energy regulations must be abolished.
The health care reforms of Barack Obama must be reviewed.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Agency for the Evaluation of Operational Programmes (EAFRD).
Trump says "destructive" trade policies are the biggest cause of America's problems.
Free trade agreements would be abandoned.
The Commission has also proposed a new tax on imports from China, which would be 45 per cent and Mexico 35 per cent.
We offer you a new future.
"Americanism, not globalism, is our religion", Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect the cities, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Contrary to his custom, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by his aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program as leading the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released her own show early Friday, Finnish time.
The storm of the past - People's News
The sea is turbulent and deadly, but the actual storm is striking the streets of Madrid. A reckoning with the past can begin.
That sums up the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel story.
Almodovar's previous directorial work, Travellers (2013), was a short-lived and satirical comedy, preceded by Skin in which I live (2011), the Spanish writer's career highlights.
In terms of level, Julieta (2016) falls somewhere in between those two works.
It is a conventional, seedy drama of love, relationships, and family, centered on the relationship between a mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is often seen as a long back story.
Life seems to be working out for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left in awe until the last few minutes of the film.
In a backward and long letter, Juliet recounts the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts with the time before his daughter was born, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
The second female lead is Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher in the TV series Time Between the Dustbines (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been dealt with in a way that may be considered a mess, but I would say time has been deliberately and literally wiped away.
From the often-singularity of Almodóvar's films to the humor of Juliet, there is a fair distance.
It is a well-acted, restrained, somewhat musical, rather melancholy film with elements of elegia.
Instead, the visual colourfulness typical of the Spanish director is retained, and so it begins to quietly strike the eye more as a pure piece of fashion than as a dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are plagued by illness, death, or other sudden losses, but the surface remains the same.
This is especially true of dress: in the case of a character, the dress changes from scene to scene, and so do the revealing earrings.
Almodóvar is precise on these matters, but the main point, the tuning of each scene, is not much improved.
When it's mechanically replicated, it's a little bit of a superficial and a little bit of a soulless effect.
Almodóvar has written the screenplay based on three novels by Canadian author Alice Munro, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.
The novels have been published in the book Running: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced literary filming.
The material would have been unmatched in emotionally intense drama, the larger the issues - especially the scandalous guilt - the film's themes address.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
The main cast is Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti, and the other three are from the same film.
The premiere is August 12th.
The government is trying to hold elections .
The new cuts will not be made, the ministers are saying, so that the Finnish people do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts completed in the spring are made on the crude market.
There will be no more surgeries.
The four billion already decided on is enough.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the programme to the Member States.
This is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as the social security cuts were decided on in the spring framework.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to national pension indices will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment insurance will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
The training cuts are continuing.
The town halls are haunting
Why do the ministers so tirelessly insist that these are the ones who will not be subjected to further surgery?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important heat meter of the election season, not the ballot box.
We have seen in the past that the result of municipal elections leading to a divergence of the parties in government spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallup, however, says that the ruling party, the Finns, expects a landslide defeat, even though its result in the previous elections was a modest 12.3% compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns won 752 new deputies, many of whom will face the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life of a government of three parties of roughly the same size depends on the strength of the Finnish fundamentalists.
This has not lasted, and more than half of the party voters had had enough of government policy within the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's activities have also emerged.
The rhetoric of 'no new cuts' is, firstly, a cover-up of the fact that next year they will be made in a drastic way and, secondly, an attempt to soften the blow that awaits the Finnish people.
The major operations in 2018?
In a year, if the Owl government is still in power, it's probably not going to be the same.
The government has set itself the objective of reducing indebtedness in this election period, but the budget proposal by Petteri Orpo will add EUR 5.9 billion to the debt next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise their hands in the middle of the election season and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: the debt has not been reduced or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means that the previous ones will be cut even more heavily in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018 and then in the spring, in the parliamentary elections, whatever happens will be accepted.
These measures did not reduce the debt
It is quite clear that the current measures are not helping to bring about a debt crisis, despite the efforts of the White Eagle to create a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary of State Martti Hetemäen at the budgetary briefing prove this in no uncertain terms:
The forecasts for global growth have repeatedly proved to be academic, meaning that there is no attraction from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recovered much since the 2008 crash, except temporarily during the early 2010s recovery.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade, from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion more per year than in 2008.
The curve presented by the previous report shows that the general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% by the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief submitted by the Left Alliance was rejected as irresponsible.
The cost of maintaining unemployment next year is about six billion euros, which will be covered virtually entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the association and the Finnish people of what is responsible.
Question: The Commission wants to leave a lot of work to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of daycare, youth work and exercise for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - the National Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
The clear majority of the population also assigns responsibility for libraries, culture, public schools, building supervision, secondary education and waste management to a single municipality.
The responsibility of the countryside, on the other hand, is most clearly intended for the county, special care, vocational training, vocational colleges and institutional care for the disabled.
No part of the municipal responsibility for the organisation of the work is to be transferred to the State.
A drunk driver underage ran after police and escaped.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove off a police patrol on the Ilomantsin Road at 1:30 a.m. on Friday.
A patrol of police tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man went off to drive the police away at a reasonable speed.
The rear end continued to Sonkajan Beach, then on to Sorronahonti and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran off the road.
After this, the young man ran away, but a faster-paced policeman caught up with him.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per millilitres.
He also did not have a driver's license to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the quarry fell into the ditch.
The truck, which was carrying the stone, fell into a ditch at the Kneef Lake in Kavinti on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had gone off the road, curving to the left, and had fallen into a ditch on its side.
The rescue team lifted the injured driver from the fallen truck through a door overhead, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
The lifting of the vehicle was left to the owner of the car.
The truck that fell spilled hydraulic oil on the road, which the rescue team sucked into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Air River .
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Lahdenkyla, southern Bavaria.
Police are looking for a woman about 5'6", thin, well-groomed, with white hair that extends below the chin.
For any sightings or clues to any missing persons, please call the Nordic Situation Centre on the hotline 0295440513.
The materials of the accident in the air . See the photo gallery of the Parafest disaster .
The floodwaters that swept over the tents of the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially viable and that the event can be held next year.
The last Parafest performer Kalle Salonen performed at the end of the night on Friday at the market square.
On Saturday, the program continues with performances at the Municipal Theater, beginning at 1 p.m.
The art center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 1 1 5 p.m.
The program will be organized as planned.
The downflow occurs in a cloud of clouds when rainwater and its weight trigger a downflow of air.
Changes in the shape of the water in the cloud bind heat, thus cooling the descending air and accelerating its velocity toward the ground.
According to the Meteorological Institute, there are several flash flows in Finland during the summer.
The path of the tidal currents is difficult to predict.
The current hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the site of the Parafest, just before 5 p.m. on Friday.
Three tents collapsed, with about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, he injured four people, all of them slightly.
One of the children was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.
Air pollution is aging Londoners
A study has shown that Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British investigation is being reported by the Evening Standard.
British skincare company Caci is analyzing the most toxic particles in the air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, say, their peers living in rural areas.
The skin-aging particles are a very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
The CAC study found that early ageing is a risk especially for Londoners who commute by foot near busy streets.
Londoners may try to protect themselves from air pollution by wearing a variety of masks, but a more practical solution is to clean the skin regularly.
The tractor brakes failed to push the man in front of you .
He had moved rocks in his yard on a tractor.
As he got out of the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor spilled on him.
The man did not fall, but the tractor managed to push him enough that he was taken to Central Hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor could not dig any farther, as it hit the rocks in front.
A new lease of life for the coming season
The Riese River Liiga-Riento, which plays in the Volleyball Champions League, will start the series in October from a better starting point than men's memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
The common thread is certainly better than in previous seasons, when the series' beginnings have been bleak for Rienn.
Jani Säisä, who will continue as Riennos head coach, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
The third-seeded center, Fred Musoni, is entering his second season in Rienna.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 6'7" point guard.
Garchet is a passenger, the Brazilian is 6'5".
Through Josba, Kataja and the Joki Boys, to the U.S. national team.
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Cup since 2003.
Now in Tampere, the sixth race is underway, only missing out on 2013 when Canada was better in the North American races.
I was working in the market, playing with the local ladies, when I noticed the ad.
The U.S. was about to form a national team for the Salibandi.
I got interested, and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the town of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen went to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such thing as a "sally band" at the SM level.
They played the game at the university.
I played basketball at Kataja and later hockey at Joki Boys in the SM-liiga, Jumppenen remembers.
Jumppanen played for the university in the saliband SM-series in the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
And while he was playing, he was coaching the A-girls to the state championship.
The women's SM-series career peaked with silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-series through 10 matches, with a balance of 169 matches, 51 + 34 = 85.
The last season of the SM is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
The Jönsulan salibandyseura Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and the Enolan-born Tatu Väänänen was selected for the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In the Helsinki League, 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this before six men's matches, where he has accumulated a total of 9 + 4 = 13.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a knee injury and is a regular member of the national team with 117 international matches.
The national team was also named after the winner of the Seinäjoen Pelivelveljetten, Mika Kohonen, who was seen in Finland's shirt for the last time at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salibandy team is Petri Kettunen from Konti.
Beach volleyball star Essi Hasu closes the circle at Kouvola - SM gold missing from the trophy case
Essi Hasu is about to retire from beach volleyball, at least temporarily, after this season.
The Finnish beach volleyball championships will be decided this weekend at the Kouvola Sports Park.
During the three days, the medal matches will be played in both the adult and junior categories.
The final tournament, organised by the Kouvola Volleyball Players' Association and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, will be contested by the top six teams in each ranking.
The local colour is represented by Essi Hasu, a native of Elimäen NMKY, who has been one of the top beach volleyball players in Finland for several years.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, looks forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible can get to the viewing room by the weekend.
I'm sure the ballpark is getting a great arena.
I haven't played in the adult series in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu is feeling.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu's passion for sports and provided a good food for a fine hobby.
I have many memories of my childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of nine, playing for the E-girls of Elimäen NMKY.
The main thing is to think about the oversized jersey, the knee pads that roll around the ankles and the high-pitched ace cries and choreography after the score, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The group spirit created an environment where it was comfortable to play.
All of our families were heavily involved - the father of a teammate coached us, and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural counterweight to indoor ball as a junior.
The curved pool has been playing music since the 1990s.
The current activity has always been active.
I also went to watch the Junior World Championships myself, thinking that one day I would be there playing.
Now this dream is coming true when Hasu plays this weekend with the beatnik Anniina Parkis in the SM finals.
The goal of the second-seeded pair in the tournament after Riik Lehtosen and Taru Lahti is clear.
The realistic goal is a medal.
We're still missing the SM gold from the prize box, and Hasu is throwing it mysteriously.
This weekend's performance at Kouvola may be the last time Hassu will be seen by an audience he knows.
At the beginning of September, we will face new challenges in the civil service.
I mean, I'm sure the international career is over after the Tournament of the Cattle.
Otherwise, the guardrails will be put on the nail, at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.
The current of the flood knocked down the tents at the event of the disabled in Joensuu, a great disaster was near
A flood washed down three tents at the Parafest festival for the disabled in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to hospital for further treatment.
According to the farmer, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the larger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened at 5:00 p.m. on Friday.
The fire chief Markus Viitaniemi, a daytime friend of the Karyalian who interviewed him, told the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
The paper says the rest of the story is at stake.

Solomon Koli Bravely Started a Farming Business
Agricultural entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweat and perseverance.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future for the countryside.
Just two years ago, together with his younger brother, Valtteri Kolli, he started the business as a continuation of their farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers from his own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant taking on debt and increasing the order so that bread could be obtained from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything on the line.
If you're going to start something, I think you should do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard raft, and at first, the bank was not too keen.
However, I was very brave in my own way and I have been fully involved in the project, says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not believe in producing clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out for the better.
Salomon Kol, a meat-car farmer, is planning to invest in an even bigger shell.
The work has paid off, with Solomon's College being named one of the ten best in the Rural Future magazine's young food producer competition.
Right now, he's competing for a chance to win.
He can vote for the paper on its website until August 21.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest level in several years (since June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0,2%.
The CPI-measured annual average inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was 0,8%.
The Commission therefore concluded that the measures in force in the Union are not sufficient to restore the viability of the Union industry.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the amount of the aid.
In July 2016, the following categories of consumer goods increased in price compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), vehicles (1,8 %), leisure and culture (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), other goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2,2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0,5%), and health (0,1%).
The following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
The Snapchat anime factory is being criticized as an Asian caricature.
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racist.
With the help of the lens tool of Snapchat, some 150 million daily users can alter reality and play with identities in ways that are close to absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are unadorned, feature-distorting tools that create over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any misjudgments will quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for promoting blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty product.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes upside down, twisted their teeth and made their cheeks pop, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to a larger problem the company has with diversity.
The news and fury spread widely on Wednesday, and was reported by online publications including The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat announced it had removed the filter.
The company explained that the lens was meant to honor anime characters, not caricatures of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of abusive stereotypes.
Some were vehemently opposed to the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet of the images was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "offensive and embarrassing to say the least".
He adds: "It is difficult to dispute the analogy of the highly flavorless Asian curry with the filter enhancers.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one taken to a degrading extreme".
Snapchat isn't the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governance to Hollywood to the devices we carry around with us.
The large audience on Snapchat is made up of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their parent counterparts, which may mean they are likely to expect even more sensitivity.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, these kinds of things are not as easily overlooked as they used to be", said Katie Zhu, 25, in an interview Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer at publishing platform Medium, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article published in Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that the ethnic conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male executive team and ended his post with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have people of color on their unilateral staff, so they can make decisions like this, or they have people of color as employees, but they're not in a position where they dare to express their opinions directly and easily", says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely refrained from responding to the allegation.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its employees, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups and promote inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn't OK".
A congressional panel of experts has concluded that military officials misrepresented intelligence on ISIS.
A congressional panel on Thursday released a report that found officials at the U.S. Central Command's command post altered intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what was being reported on the ground.
The Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on intelligence and defense spending set up a task force to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts, who say senior military officials are "bending" their assessment of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, abbreviated Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by senior Centcom executives generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism than the facts on the ground showed, and were invariably more positive than the analyses of other intelligence community units", says a press release on the report.
"The Centcom events are unacceptable  our soldiers are suffering when high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses", says California Republican Rep. Ken Calvert.
"The errors of Centcom's management extend to the highest levels of the organization".
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 that Central Command's descriptions and analyses of US efforts to train Iraqi forces contain.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obama administration were falsified, it does give analysts a sense that Centcom executives had pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and congressional testimony were significantly more positive than the reality", says the report.
'For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.'
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear", says Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence officers in the U.S. military manipulated intelligence obtained to minimize the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq".
The Republicans formed a task force after they learned of the suspicions raised by analysts that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results as research continues.
In addition, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense has launched an investigation into the Centcom intelligence.
On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee's Democratic members released their own findings, which were in part consistent with the Republican task force's conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restrictive process for assessing intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces", said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic member of the committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "offended the morale of analysts" and "insufficiently ignored dissenting views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "a predetermined or official political line".
The Daily Beast news site reported on Tuesday the preliminary findings of a congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the Pentagon's inspector general's investigation, which was launched in response to complaints by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these key national security issues".
The investigation has other implications besides seeking to establish whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has been successful (a claim made by several defence authorities).
But the claims made last year may have called into question how much President Obama can trust Central Command to provide honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of the ISIL intelligence is similar to the disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that the administration of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only a small number of troops in Iraq and spent little time considering the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker was also a key player in the insurgency against ISIL intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year Hooker's task force concluded that despite conflicting public statements, the airstrikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the investigation were not disclosed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after many lawmakers found testimony to the Senate to be too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced as commander of Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins its fourth women's field hockey double and establishes its position in the interim with Great Britain.
After scoring three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday, as the U.S. beat India.
Five goals in two games might be considered a big achievement, but 27-year-old Bam wasn't sure if he had ever done it that way before.
"I have no idea", he says.
"I'm not one of those people who keeps score on the paintings they make".
But he knows this: The Americans have won four games and lost zero in their Olympic tournament, and are tied for first place in their group with Great Britain, which continued its winning streak by beating Japan by 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Each team made it to the final, which will decide which of them will place first and which second in a six-team block.
The first-placed team avoids the long-term confrontation with the hard-hitting Dutch team that won the second block.
Regardless of what happens on Saturday, the Americans have already raised the bar for their surprise success at these games, four years after finishing last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up the field hockey when he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played at Drexel), and made the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest national team player ever.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final roster.
Then came the 2012 races, in which he and his team had little success.
The following year, Craig Parnham of England was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"It was a cultural, emotional, and physical change", says Bam.
"Our work in London was not what it is now.
We have made a complete turnaround".
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half by hitting the ball close to home with a rushing touchdown.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but they proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 lead until the third period, when Bam stepped on the field.
Bam carried the ball long on the left side of the field, twisted into midfield, hit the ball into the goal and led the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The game was the first in the tournament in which U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal clear, with the Americans having a goal every time in the first three games.
Briggs is in the prime of his career.
So did Bam.
"We're in a good position right now", says Parnham, "but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
♪ In the middle of the Olympic hurricane ♪ ♪ My trampoline brings the genius ♪
No matter where or when, the Olympics are inevitable.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next passionate message continuously and everywhere.
It's as if the Olympic chair itself is a flaming messenger that passes from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast, gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympian with a charming smile, could well be a name on everyone's lips, a name that would be seen and heard in the best of times, a favorite of sponsors, and a goodwill TV commercial if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for the Olympic gold medal on the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all the competitions equally.
Farther from the center, in part in the shade, are lesser-known sports, such as air pistol shooting, archery, volleyball, and taekwondo.
We'll always have the breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest story about my own special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampolines have been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, their visibility over the past 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed did not even know that they were an Olympic sport.
Ignorance may be regional.
The United States has had athletes compete in Olympic trampolining, but it never won a medal or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to be going to the Chinese and the Russians, and on the women's side, the medalists are the Canadians.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend this year's gold medals, which they won in London.
But trampoline has the charm of an underdog, partly because to the uneducated ear, it sounds more like a circus school than an Olympic event.
(I confess that I am no expert, just a fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in endless bouncing scenes of characters, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming, the species that essentially connect on the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning "trampolining board".
Ambitious champions will jump on a huge trampoline that will propel them to a height of nearly 30 feet [10 m].
According to the official Olympic program, jumping is judged on performance, difficulty, and "flying time".
The Rio Trampoline Championship is contested by 32 athletes from 17 different countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic course is straight forward.
In pursuit of gold, the medalists must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth across the field.
Besides the finish line or the starting line, they have another goal they strive for in television newsreels, namely, a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical  and enough to even bring the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a little tiring just watching the games.
This trampoline will give you a breathing space.
The trampoline is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The booster jumps up weightless like an astronaut, falls down, and then sinks back up without any effort.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect to the sport, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a dash to the finish or a long jump, only a dreamlike and mellow combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only an Olympic event can get.
The women's qualifiers and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, starting at 1 p.m. local time, with the men's qualifiers taking place on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will begin at 2:00 p.m. local time on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic Games, they bring a moment of peace and beauty that might be overlooked in the midst of the general uproar.
And if awareness can be raised just by offering attractive male athletes to watch and objectifying them  as the US men's gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal  then Logan Dooley is just waiting for a dazzling new fan base.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed protests demanding political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia going to collapse?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, in recent months the country has been rocked by anti-government protests that are spreading to wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Videos of the protests, allegedly filmed late last year or early this year, show security forces beating young people with sticks, who are forced to stand with their hands against a wall.
The UN's top human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country together has always been difficult, and moving forward is even harder", says Rashid Abdi, research director of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group.
By population, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, and has been stabilized by Western countries.
The US military and intelligence services are supporting the Ethiopians closely in their fight against the terrorist threat throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has been growing at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically, with the capital city of Addis Ababa even having a new commuter railway.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from a model of democracy, with human rights organisations continuously reporting on the government's repressive policies, the opposition in the country being very limited and dissent being quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven into the wilderness.
But things may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to express their opinion, they will come out", says Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
"All youth show their mind.
A whole generation protested".
There are many causes of dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to the government coalition's throttling of power.
After last year's widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies finally won the seat previously held by the opposition, which means they now control the whole parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions are rising on the Eritrean border, where a war in June left hundreds dead.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the chaos and rearm.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is the seemingly innocent: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and Internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many still access the Internet through proxy servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths said that this was how they called people to demonstrate.
Another reason is the growing solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest populations, the Oromo and the Amhara.
The Oroms and Amhara are not natural allies.
The Amhara, who are predominantly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country's politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, a large Muslim population living in low-lying areas.
But this is changing, too.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are coming under the same umbrella", says Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest protests have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amhara and Swami feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the tiger tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet controls the military, intelligence, commerce, and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between the two sides.
"The present government lacks this essential instinct", says conflict researcher Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped into Meles' shoes almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't trust the security forces run by the tiger tribe.
Many fear this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots was in 2005, when thousands protested against elections that analysts say were rigged and then stolen by the government.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although fewer than in previous months, and the unrest subsided relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure plans, such as the new commuter train, and for making significant progress in fighting poverty.
But it has clearly not prevented internal resentment against the Ethiopian government from growing.
And the resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked tiger-owned businesses in the Amhara city of Gondari, and hate speech against tigers is spreading on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a precarious position.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aerial vehicles monitoring neighboring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, according to the US.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to collapse.
"This requires a strict balance", says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried to retract his words on Friday in the latest campaign controversy by claiming that he did not mean to claim President Obama and Hillary Clinton as the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS several times this week.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to clearly communicate to the people of his country.
The embarrassment is also for his supporters, who must try to defend their candidate at this turbulent time and explain comments he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at a campaign rally Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
However, early Friday morning, Trump tweeted that his statement was sarcasm.
Trump tweeted back and forth on his speech the day before, saying in several interviews that he was completely serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his argument by saying that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest storm of criticism came as Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy as voter turnout fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy keynote addresses in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
He tweeted that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
In late July, he received widespread criticism for appealing to the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail, later explaining his comments by saying, "Of course I was being sarcastic".
This is Trump's way of stretching the boundaries of political speech and retracting his words when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that arouse a reaction from his supporters, looking at how they react to the messages and then 'clarifying' one way or another depending on the reaction", says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his arguments and knows that they are sufficiently round to pass through different seams".
Instead of softening his statements to the election crowd, Trump has changed his style in recent days to be even more pointed as his support numbers have continued to fall.
A new poll released Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist found Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton's in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while Florida is a close tie.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after being subjected to increasing scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position of having to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, vigorously defended the presidential candidate in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I consider his statements to be justified, political", Giuliani said when asked whether Trump was truthful in his claim that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little, little, little organization that Obama completely misnamed 'the bottom tier team,' and that's why it happened, because he pulled troops out of Iraq".
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its activities when it failed to deal decisively with the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's Pennsylvania election, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of overstating his remarks and discriminating against him.
He mocked the "worthless and pathetic" television commentators who try to get to know him, but he says they cannot succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, saying it only made it clearer that he was not fit to be president.
A coffee shop in Greenpoint has closed because of an unfairly high rent.
Verb Cafe was a somewhat sloppy coffee shop in Williamsburg, cash only, no Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its corner location on Bedford Avenue when the rent went unreasonable.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals consider this low-middle-class avoidance of the loss of a café to be pitiful.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB club is gone, the Chelsea Hotel is torn down and Verb is now a soap shop".
But even though New York City is not the same, it's also a place where new things are being created.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi and credit card payments, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unpretentious.
The coffee's still good, too.
The new Verb Cafe is owned and operated by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old one.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When one client offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
And it even re-instated the old Verbe lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new, though.
Added new products to the list.
They're all made with bacon, chicken eggs, cheese sandwiches, and capers and browned onion rings.
There's also a list of blackberries.
Coffee is no longer beer, but fresh fruit juices.
After running the cafe for nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regulars were starting to come to Verb in a steady stream.
"A lot of our old customers got priced out of Williamsburg", he says.
One of them is Rebecca Oliveira, who went to the coffee shop on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and was a regular visitor to Verbe.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took a walk to the Verby, then in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he said he stopped making coffee for a while.
"I found myself liking Verbi's coffee and culture", he says.
Now he is drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea mixture instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also a novelty on the menu.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He always went to the coffee shop before work and always ordered the same thing.
"I would walk into the coffee shop every day at 7:15 like a machine, and there they would make my butterballs with all the fillings", she says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally changes bagels to include bacon, eggs, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge that the soap store took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cher even offered to make a special soap made from Verb's own cold-pressed coffee.
"We may still be able to take the offer", Rodriguez says.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also welcomed the coffee.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez says that he is now looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought with it other advantages.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell a coffee shop's frozen coffee.
The cafe may also expand to an adjacent building.
But for many customers, it's enough to get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular at Williamsburg, and he says he was heartbroken when the cafe closed.
When the new place opened and I ordered coffee, it felt like coming home, says Whitt.
"I needed the smell of coffee".
The bitter food of the great depression in a new work, A Square Meal.
In March 1933, shortly after he was inaugurated as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his office at the White House.
A noted culinary expert, President Roosevelt had a fondness for the luxury foods of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as goose liver pies and Maryland turtle soup.
That day, his menu was more modest: devil's eggs in a tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and plum chicken for dessert.
"It was a culinary gesture of solidarity with people who suffered", says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat".
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights, both of whom work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, is about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of a Lower East Side apartment building through food.
Their new collaborative work, published by Harper and released Tuesday, is A Square Meal, which depicts the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by arranging for the meeting place with the journalist to be Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the Great Depression, 1929.
Mr. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Mr. Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple said it was a good fit for a conversation about eating a big vacation.
"The murals were very popular", says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut butter, liver butter, and beans.
They were made of materials that were cheap and competitive.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that you can eat the whole meal".
Andrew Coe is a mocker.
"It must have been pressing like lead in my stomach", he says.
Before the great depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the "eat as much as you want" buffet principle.
The women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which people survived when their abundance was suddenly forced to give up.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic in American conversation", says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: According to Ziegelman, such mysterious foods as crackers and jellyfish became staples, and jellyfish were called "a powerful way to tap into food resources", because chefs could cover less appealing ingredients in cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been a staple of the American diet for years, became a sparingly used luxury.
We tried strange mixtures, where the most important thing was the calorie and nutritional content, not the taste or even the sense of cooking.
In research for the book, which also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven bowls filled with peanut butter, which were used as food during the Great Depression.
"It was not popular at the dinner table", says Coe, to which
Ziegelman added: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and baking soda are not compatible.
This was the characteristic of many household recipes".
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was head of the Federal Household Bureau from 1923 to 1943, guided the eating habits of the citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be strict budget keepers and to take up the challenge of making tasty dishes from pumpkins like carrot-and-butter paste.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic treats.
Particularly tasty are accounts of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he ate himself, like the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish and turkey sauce", says Coe.
"He ate in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality".
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had his wife Eleanor not encouraged him to set an example by his belly.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the food served at the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared".
Many of the food items from the Depression were discarded as soon as the land recovered.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still seen in the way we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they began to understand more about Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she could not throw food away.
"He was really afraid that he was going to have to throw away the food", says Coe.
"People even started getting sick of his food", recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, one time about the wind chill".
After the main plates were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out their homemade plum dessert, the same one President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called foam", says Ziegelman, adding that giving a fancy name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
We reluctantly dipped our spoon in a thick brown mud.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe did it the second time, and the third time.
"German walnuts would do better", Coe tells his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Gilead was paid full attorney's fees for a patent dispute with Merck for a hepatitis C drug.
A United States District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. was entitled to full compensation for legal fees incurred in a patent dispute with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. over a hepatitis C drug.
Gilead was acquitted in June of $200 million in damages for infringement of two patents owned by Merck in connection with Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni drugs, a U.S. judge finding Merck guilty of violations that included false whale-sharing and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit filed Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to an exemption from the attorney's fees it incurred for defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominating the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat as many as 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the proprietary rights to the laboratory-derived sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed forces have captured Manbij from ISIS .
US-backed forces have taken control of the northern Syrian town of Manzib, near the Turkish border, as the last of the Islamic State militants left the town, a spokesman for the forces said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now searching the city for the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the SDF-affiliated Manbij Military Council, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages held by ISIS fighters had been released.
"We have the city in our hands now, but we are still conducting search operations", Darwish said.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal taxes.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, revealing that she and her husband had income of $10.75 million and paid a true federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reported earning $3 million from the Simon & Schuster Foundation for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, released their 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model for financial transparency", said Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to release his tax returns.
Traditionally, candidates for president of the United States have always released their tax returns, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have invoked the IRS audit as the reason why Trump has not released his income statements.
"Transfer is yours", tweeted Clinton campaign aide Ian Sam, referring to the Democratic nominee's tax filing.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit was complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, have said that his refusal to release the information raises questions about Trump's own wealth, his charitable giving, his business relationships and many other ties, including ties to Russia.
Clinton has grabbed this question and posted a video online on Friday showing prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release his tax returns.
Clinton brought up the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan on Thursday.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, not to release his tax returns", Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid no or little tax for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted several tax lawyers and auditors as saying the situation could remain the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has been a supporter of a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama is also in favor of the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton campaign rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway investment firm is headquartered in the same place, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax returns.
Buffet says he too has been audited by the IRS and that Trump is not afraid of the IRS, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been releasing tax returns since 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was in salary earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, and the Clintons reported a total of $109,000 in dividends and interest income.

Chili powder-filled telephones to help protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have developed an unusual method of keeping elephants away from human habitation - they are scared by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has partnered with the U.S. Nature Conservancy to launch a campaign to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and crops without harming elephants.
Not long ago, spears were used to scare elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
"We have seen a change in attitudes in these villages since we developed the method, as villagers can now trust that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming them", says Honeyguide Foundation executive director Damian Bell in a press release.
First, the intruder is disturbed by a flashlight and a horn.
If this doesn't work, we throw what's called a chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with soil is placed in the condom together with the lightning rod, and the condom head is then closed so that only the spark plug is left out.
When the fuse is ignited, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually, one cloud of spices is enough to drive the elephant away.
The final means is a throw that fires a firework, known as a Roman candle, into the air, producing a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli route number from Arab "expression"  RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a media sensation when he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not mention the Israeli area code in its country code listing.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel from the hotel's route number list.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed  as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann is writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The director asked me to explain the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that he was shocked by the receptionist's response.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels".
The reason behind the procedure shocked the filmmaker even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "Most of our visitors are Arabs, and they are demanding that the Israeli route number be removed".
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, who was interviewed by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the case "a great shame".
"The incident shocks and upsets us all.
It's a shame.
And it is all the more shameful when we consider that we are in Germany and it is this hotel chain.
That's all the explanation you need.
We are waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions,' says the Ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction on the net, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the demands of the alleged Arab customers.
"Shame", said a publication pointing to the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"A direct order to exclude Israel from the route number list was never given", writes Suddeutsche Zeitung, quoting a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the route number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets at a protest by Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the student crowd, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the protest, protesting against the government's plans.
The governor of the state of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a cost-cutting measure that would close nearly 100 public schools and transfer 300,000 students to new schools.
Some of the protesters graffitied the walls protesting against the temporary incumbent president, Michel Temer.
The student protest came just days after the streets filled with protesters who had been dismissed from the rally in support of President Dilma Rousseff after the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 %
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent, says Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
He said that the interest of Russian companies in doing business in Iran has increased since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
'Russian companies are continuing their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further growth of trade is of course one of the main objectives of cooperation between countries", says Dzhagaryan.
The Commission notes that the Russian Federation has not provided any evidence that the measures in question were in line with the Union interest.
'In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
Trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons", says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
'Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries whose citizens visited Russia in terms of tourist numbers.
And it is not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year", he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, meanwhile, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a trip to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he says.
Scottishman Callum Skinner scored the winning goal for the British cycling team.
Scotland's Callum Skinner made headlines at the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night as the British trio defended their 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, played the role of anchor, which he inherited from his compatriot Sir Chris Hoyle, a Scot, and made the youngster a legend by scoring and taking victory over the New Zealand team, which was regarded as a pre-favorite.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing only sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March, despite Hoy's retirement from racing.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first tower.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoye's decision to retire also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scottishman Skinner was a man the British coaches believed in and saw potential in, and now he's redeemed it.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoye four years ago, set an Olympic record in the time trial, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in the doubles.
Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny was pushing for the team lead that Skinner kept.
Much of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes was driving at a higher gear to slow down, which allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up.
Hoy followed from his position as BBC commentator and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hinds as they stepped up to the podium.
"I'm flattered by the comparison", says Skinner, 23, of Glasgow.
I'm just trying to do my best and make it work.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world championships.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it".
After winning London 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoye, admitted that he had deliberately fallen off the track due to a bad start.
Later he retracted his words, and the British competitors had no remedy.
This time, the sovereign won without the problems of this time.
Hindes says: "It was like London, all the British flags flying in the view.
Our team has been unified over the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great".
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the ten championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made in the last five months, then we have five successful days ahead of us on the velodrome.
As Kenny has shown with his ability, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoye's achievements and winning three Olympic medals in one Olympics.
This would mean a tally of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya and was also born on 23 March (the magical date for British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medal rewards would be the same as Hoyle's.
Kenny's next race is a sprint that starts today and ends in three days.
Kenny, 28, from Bolton, says: "Right now, I can only be happy.
Team competition is always the best.
You'll enjoy the win with the guys.
"Winning alone is a little lonely".
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-man team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be contested today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will surely be on Wiggins.
He had a fight with the race editors yesterday before the time trial when the editors called him to measure his height.
In the women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain can now count on its great cycling team to take charge of the Olympic half-marathon and bring home a slew of medals.
After the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been drama behind this, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of the careers of great athletes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night of the Velodrome shows that Britain's already legendary moment of glory is once again coming true.
Portland smelter's future at risk due to the expiry of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers, are at stake when the power company supplying the smelter with electricity announced that one of the plant's owners is dissolving the supply contract and that all supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the result of the Victorian Government's decision earlier this year not to continue the subsidies to keep the plant running.
The fixed 20 year grant will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
As many as 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of layoffs.
The snowball effect could grow further, with the smelter consuming around 10% of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which prompted the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Portland smelter Alcoan is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and more recently by the production price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other smelter owners to also terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina, with CITIC of China and Marubeni Corp of Japan holding minority shares.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
The AGL states that the agreements are so-called protection agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
'AGL therefore expects the contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017,' the power plant says.
The potential effects on AGL's profitability from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong market outlook for the future in terms of wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million "in anticipation of the termination of the contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts 'does not affect Alcoa's ability to maintain the smelter in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter'.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into force from November this year, although it has yet to clarify why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
The weak economic situation in the sector has led to analysts being cautious in their estimates of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomagon plant near Newcastle.
AGL's Chief Operating Officer Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts annually.
'The removal of these plants from the market would mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as producers, that would not be good news", says Mikkelsen.
The Kardashians made Kendall the cover girl for Vogue in September.
The Kardashian-Jenner-clan model and fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue USA.
Kendall, the public face of Estee Lauder and a model who has appeared at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at her in a room full of my loved ones made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?) scripted video featuring all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar-gound Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest) pretending to forget their sister's cover.
The plot is clichéd, and it is used in almost every birthday episode of the show (Seacrest says the words, "Did you think we forgot you?" as sincerely as a cartoon character on children's morning TV), but Kris had to somehow get her other daughters involved in this publicity.
Because her appearance in Vogue's September issue is undeniably the start of a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made Vogue's cover before (she appeared on Vogue's cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September issue is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
A number that is more like a large picture book than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion website Fashion estimated that last year's 832-page brochure contained 615 pages of advertisements).
The cover of the September issue is so eagerly awaited that in the two previous years, the magazine's images have leaked to the public before the official announcement.
Previously, the September cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more of a celebrity working as a model than a celebrity model.
Oscar-winning Dior celebrity Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga took the honor.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model of her generation, and although she would rather be counted among the models, she is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality TV stars, or today's kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry above all others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career behind her, with the release of her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner's place in the fashion world will always be a shambles.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid for calling them "narcotics".
These feelings have resurfaced when news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
But the continuing intensification of discontent seems to be irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September issue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He walks around Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
She's the face of the Estee Lauder makeup creams.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he shot for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, maybe just to meet her sister and her kids.
Legal aid centers turn 160,000 people away a year.
Each year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people in the country are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact of the additional cuts in funding on already marginalised centres.
In Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal aid and legal services are turned away  most of them are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices, people who struggle without resources.
The public legal services, which are already overburdened, are preparing for additional cuts in appropriations.
Starting next June, the Legal Aid Centers are in danger of losing another 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, says that thousands of people are already turned away from the centres each year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres.
If the federal government doesn't reconsider, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal services are continually underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are turned away when they seek essential services", says Farrell.
"People leaving abusive relationships, people in unmanageable and crippling debt, families breaking up, workers unjustly dismissed  all have problems with legal matters and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government is planning to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brandy of Queensland to abandon these cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
It is time to take account of the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.'
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued after supposedly no action was taken after its executive was told that a North Carolina campaign manager had threatened a worker with a gun while they were driving a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be addressed internally before he realised, in his own words, that this was not going to happen.
Bordini says in his complaint that campaign manager Earl Phillip "picked out a pistol, put his right forefinger on the trigger and pressed the pipe on Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, after complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini was told that at least four other people had experienced the same as Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage", says Bordini in his complaint.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a public outcry by telling a crowd in North Carolina that "second amendment supporters" - who are considered to be gun owners and gun owners - could take action if her opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and gets to choose judges.
Trump's campaign staff said the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not encourage violence in his words.
Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent management and from Phillip for assault, abuse and the emotional suffering caused by them.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking for comment.
Phillip was never reached despite his best efforts.
Charlotte's local news outlet WCCB reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to Phillip's consultancy, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been on a controversial campaign trail.
The Court of Appeal held that the Commission had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
The British must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow.
Heathrow is also a source of economic recovery and prosperity  not just for local communities and London, but for the whole country.
For me, this was the thing that really interested me about Heathrow, and like the London Olympics in 2012, we put a lot of effort into making sure that our entire nation and all our regions benefit from it.
The Olympics were a tremendous benefit to Stratford and the East End.
We're doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the airport area.
As with the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As regards the Olympics, I have been told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be embarrassed in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspicions were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits the many, not the few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to grow the economy by £211 billion, bringing skills and jobs to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered on time and within budget an infrastructure investment programme of £11 billion, including Terminal T5 - voted best airport of the year for two years running - and Terminal T2 - built between two of the busiest airports in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be as well.
It is time we put the same Olympic spirit into the Heathrow expansion, so that we can secure the future of our trade and create skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in the cat-and-mouse game of ad blocking
Attempts by companies that make money from online advertising to mislead ad-blocking software have become a cat-and-mouse game, says one company that produces ad-blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad blocking programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it said that users could update their ad blocking software filters and thus block the social network's ads again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the labeling codes for ads on its desktop site so that it would be harder for ad-blocking software to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock is telling us they've cracked the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of ballgame between the open source ad blocker community and the deceivers has been going on since ad blocker was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own corrective move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertisers have created for the industry.
According to a study last year by PageFair and Adobe, an estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad-blocking software, a number that has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in ad-blocking in its desktop application, as the mobile ad-blocking software does not work on Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram, according to the informant.
The revenue from desktop advertising is still quite high, which is why Facebook considered the investment to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it would update its user settings ad tool to give users more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, saying they also prevent some regular Facebook posts from being seen.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we're going to fix the problem", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
"Advertising controls are cumbersome and inefficient, so we have instead invested in developing user settings similar to advertising tools so that people can control their own ad targeting".
A woman committed suicide by getting hit by a car on a Swiss motorway .
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for eyewitnesses to the accident on the highway in the early hours of Thursday, where a woman deliberately left herself under several cars.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud, near Morges, shortly after midnight.
The woman committed her desperate act by lying on a dark road and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, clearly had attempted suicide, and a truck was among the oversized cars.
She died at the scene.
Police say many of the drivers involved in the accident have been interviewed, but some are still unidentified and police are asking them or other witnesses to come forward.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneve that a criminal investigation had been opened, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be charged.
"Was the collision impossible to avoid?
That remains for the prosecutor to determine", says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two cases of this kind where drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases, the newspaper reported, the person was walking on a dark highway, and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into pedestrians on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police department cleared him of the death penalty charge after he collided with a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on a night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking heavily and had passed out on the road.
The Court held that the driving of the police officer responding to the emergency call was justified and that the man lying on the road was a 'completely exceptional and unforeseen situation'.
Anyone with any information about the accident near Morges on Thursday is requested to call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been habitable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model that allows us to study the past of Venus using the same tools and algorithms that meteorologists use.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions on Venus could have been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless on the surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously proposed that Venus's slow rotation is explained by its thick, gaseous atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to that of Earth, and yet it has been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"Venus, in the GISS model, is slowly rotating and has a daytime half-time of almost two months at a time", explains GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that act as an umbrella, shielding much of the surface from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperature of the earth is even a few degrees lower than today's.
The model was used to create a story of Venus that matches previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been habitable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the evaporated water.
When the hydrogen was drawn into space, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and the deadly greenhouse effect.
The researchers reported the results of a new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is resigning as Avalanche head coach .
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from his position as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice president of hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado's vice president/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the team will begin immediately to search for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche and as the team's vice president of hockey operations with determination, passion, and determination", says Roy, 50.
"I have spent the summer thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to the next level.
To achieve this, the coach and the team vice-president of hockey operations must be in full alignment with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.'
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today", Sakic says.
"We are grateful for all he has done for our organization, and we wish him well for the future".
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's coach of the year for his first season as head coach of the Avalanche in 2013 and 2014.
Under his leadership, the team scored 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made the postseason in the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 record in the 2015-2016 season and were five points behind the Minnesota Wild in the Wild Card round of the Western Conference playoffs.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend strike
The chief negotiators say the strike on the wages of North Sea oil workers will be suspended as all parties to the dispute enter into a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been held against the oilfield services company Wood Group at the drilling rigs operated by Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to the joint statement of the parties, 'Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute'.
From the beginning of next week we will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will be discussing problems from a fresh perspective.
The unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, in protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group is cutting tariffs for its North Sea contractors by around 9% this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows the calculation of the prices of contractors working abroad by 10% in 20114.
The company claims that the additional cuts will give it the flexibility necessary to cope with the downward trend in the market.
Shell, meanwhile, has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to cease oil and gas drilling in as many as 10 countries, in an effort to boost its operations following its mega-merger with British energy firm BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest job losses the North Sea has experienced in a generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the Mediterranean and across the country, we need an economy that benefits the many, not just the few", says Anderson.
The Commission will also assess the impact of the new measures on the environment and the environment, including the impact of the new measures on the environment.
Kepler is measuring the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the rotation speed of stars, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list yet of the rotation speeds of stars in the Pleiades.
With the new information, astronomers can find out why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbital times relate to planet formation.
"By comparing the results with other star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star and its age, and even about the history of its solar system", says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif., in a press release.
The Pleiades constellation is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in this cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means they're just about to reach adulthood.
They're spinning faster than ever.
At their peak, the stars are spewing massive amounts of stellar wind from their adult stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate starts to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of identifiable star spots (which are equivalent to sunspots).
The latest listed rotation rates suggest that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers. The bigger ones spin slower than the smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiades' 'dance' that the slow-spinning ones are typically larger, while the fastest-spinning ones are typically very light stars", says Rebull.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they are an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars in relation to their rotational velocities.
"The Pleiades constellation provides a support for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars", says Rebull.
We want to know more about how, when, and why stars slow down and stop "dancing".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the rotational velocities of the Pleiades in three new articles soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
