Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday with a helicopter over the colombian capital Bogota.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination equipped with wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters of altitude, where many badauds had gathered to observe its outcome.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the road infrastructure in decrépitude, many are those who intervene a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the car board.
The devices, which record all the miles travelled by a driver and transmit the information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices of planning to repair the obsolete funding system of the major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector of big axes planning has suddenly caused a strong debates and moving alliances.
Liberals have joined ecologist groups to press so that the government uses the small boxes to keep the trace of the miles you’re traveling, and eventually the road you’re circulating, and then use the information to write a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concerns regarding privacy protection.
And while Congress members are unable to reach an agreement on whether it should continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles passed.
Thousands of drivers have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for a experimental shift.
This is essential for our nation.
“It’s not as if we had a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will start recording the miles travelled by each California driver by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with the taxes that Americans pay to the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans are not buying as much fuel as before.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are refusing to raise the tax, even by one hundred, while fuel prices are high.
“The fuel tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently installed tracker on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
“This is the most logical alternative in the long term,” he said.
Wonks calls this the cost of use per kilometre.
It is not surprising that the idea attracts the liberal citizens, as taxes could be used to change behavior habits in such a way as reducing burns and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to the goals set in the ambitious state laws on climate warming.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation’s free market supporters also appreciate the idea of paying drivers per mile.
“It’s not just a tax dying into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretaries for Transports who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the way of paying the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the chairman of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or to the city.
However, many states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country’s most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay to the state kilometre fees instead of fuel taxes.
The Netherlands has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
The Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which comprises 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers have recently equipped their car with a machine, drivers were worried that the government could follow their smallest facts and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of things are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transport.
This is not something people want.
From the start of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its site: “It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full localization devices.”
It is not necessary to build an enormous and overwhelming technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep the records of people’s daily walks and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help drivers who pay taxes to the states.
She sought to penetrate the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices she tested liked the big axes planners because they don’t use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Large errors have been made in the pilot programs of some countries.
There are much less expensive means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering drivers different choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In the city of New York, transport managers are looking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide a “driving payment” insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid bumping.
“Drivers would be encouraged to participate due to the benefits that the system offers them,” a document on urban planning said.
However, some transport planners wonder if all the debate on the mile payment is not just an enormous distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising fuel taxes.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on the drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles don’t consume a lot of fuel, so that everyone pays their right share.
“It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, Director of Legislation and Public Affairs at the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished
The English musician has not ended to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, released in January, he made a luxury re-edition planned for November 4, with several unpublished.
Four have already appeared on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantoys.
On the day of his 66th birthday, on January 8, 2013, he had announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, date of 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that we could still rely on him to scint the pop scene.
A party for his fans.
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke is scheduled to re-edite this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he prepared a real party for his fans.
This re-edition, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three albums: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already revealed clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five specially revealed songs for the event, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both each of the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a booklet to share his own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, most importantly, he gives an advance of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very advanced guitars and a wisely controlled rock electricity.
Unknown already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-face: a worrying intro before a bright cavalcade that gradually slows down to leave room for a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie wanted to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next to it, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, cheerful, give the desire to leave the Earth.
In any case, Bowie enjoys playing the cameleon with these titles: tour-to-tour informator, man on board a rocket, martyr potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, he plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing surprising is that he has a hand mask in the photo of the campaign L’Invitation au Voyage, of the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from 10 November.
Defense Minister Rob Nicholson insisted to say that the wounded soldiers were not summarically released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civil life.
Attacked by the liberals and the neo-democrats at the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, the army members followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care in order to return to civil life and no one of them is released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not meet the rule of "universality of service" of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a series of different tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They also cited two cases by the Canadian Press, including the case of a soldier released last Friday.
Captain David Hawkins, a reservoir from London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after that of Captain Glen Kirkland, who said before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins emphasized that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was completely different from the fact that he wanted to leave the rows.
“I told them I was not ready,” he said in an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major battles in Afghanistan, the army has been hard to determine what latitude it can give to the wounded soldiers who want to stay in the rows, but who are not capable of fighting.
According to current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year to the Parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the duration of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal spokesman for former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, demanded the reintegration of Captain Hawkins on Wednesday, while neodemocrat Jack Harris demanded the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney puts on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prefer tablets to its own TV channels for the next release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the site watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet app.
Its global release on the Disney group’s channels is scheduled only in 2014, details the announcement of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a west American city where she makes the order rule with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two stories of 11 minutes.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, cited in the statement.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age had already served a tablet or a phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, respectively, 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence officer, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr. Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: “While the result of my efforts has been obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a flight and seeks to punish the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, saying the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to give up the criminal charges held against him.
In the framework of the complaint submitted by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make it possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have been put to a hard test after complaints that the NSA had listened to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who leads the parliamentary group supervising foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him in danger and completely ruining the relations with the United States", it was to take advantage of it.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Green member, posted a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA consultant’s lawyer, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden witnessed in Germany, it would be necessary to give him the assurance that he would be "safe" there, the deputy said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged that the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility.
The letter advances an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could have access to apps such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the video service on request Netflix via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so far.
Cogeco’s subsidiary said on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to highlight more friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco’s chairman and chief executive Louis Audet explained in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus brings the step to its competitors, such as Bell, although Cogeco’s subsidiary has not yet a precise date regarding this new platform.
“We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Mr. Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers currently have no access.
The telecom giant Rogers has already stated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been quoted, could be fixed.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also greeted the announcement made by the Harper government during his throne speech, last October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the possibility of paying for the card services.
“It’s been about two and a half years that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy significant chain packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
However, he hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will result in interesting recommendations.
“These discussions will have to emerge from a kind of new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy as regards television,” said Cogeco’s p.d.g.
CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the result side, Cogeco said it had a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is a decline compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, from the same period last year.
The company based in Montreal explains this decline by amortization costs associated with new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, in 2012 for 1.36 billion dollars.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed in Portugal.
In December last year, the Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for a sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenue, they saw a 41,5% growth in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
It is 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenue increased by 45% to 470,4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased by 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of customers fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a trend change, he observed.
It varies from a quarter to a quarter with a strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat was detected in conserve boxes of beef-based products, sold by two small British low-cost distribution stores, the agency responsible for food hygiene announced today.
Routine tests showed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save channels, contained 1 to 5 percent horse DNA.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredients list, it shouldn't have been present in the product," the UK agency explained.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles caused four injured, early Friday, on the road 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a driver who was driving north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four passengers of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal around 6 p.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start paying up to $100 for a hand baggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement, it indicated that passengers could take the unopen bag with them at the flight descent.
The new hand baggage fees apply to the bags ranged in the upper area, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if passengers paid only once at the boarding door.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she said.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second luggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the hand baggage ranged in the upper apartments, so there was often no more space in those apartments.
These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees won't really serve to collect money.
It is about making the most faithful customers of Frontier understand that it becomes more and more difficult to find room in the upper departments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the hole to a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the hole could have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these fees before they arrive at the door.
Frontier's handbagage fees will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been fixed.
Passengers often rush about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that the cost of handling the luggage is significant and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street see the baggage fee adding as a sign that proves that airlines are paying expensive enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not cover the luggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage fees three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company that imposes such fees is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional fees.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s hand luggage costs accounted for $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines manager, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding door at the time when passengers discovered the unusual hand luggage fees imposed by the company.
“I’ve never seen such a fluid boarding procedure throughout my professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see clots of teeth and a struggle out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “the passengers were on board at the speed of the lightning.”
Frontier also does as Spirit and applies $2 fees for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can take the unopen pot with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to pay hands-on luggage fees when passengers don’t buy their tickets directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay to online travel vendors such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half miles of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced the miles premiums by 25 percent on a trip.
So, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would make you win 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal customer in his hometown, Denver, but his business goes back and it loses money.
Revenue decreased by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by 13% during the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by its mother company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to repair the finances of Frontier by selling the airline.
NSA claims a “internal error” rather than hackers for the failure of its website
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been broken for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The former ultra-secret NSA, once called the “No Such Agency”, has found itself under the fire of the projectors and has been strongly criticized over the past few months following a wave of revelations about its vast national and foreign communications monitoring programs – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen to the agency and disclosed by the former misleading NSA consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused many speculations that this evening incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The city center is closed.
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked in the hotel.
Of them, 200 have not yet found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let its employees fall.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the site, we met the employees individually to evaluate their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Delta Hotels Regional Director for Work Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta occurs in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was the owner of that building had choices to make.
Or he was reinvesting in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
“Of he sold it to someone else and that’s what happened,” says Paul Arsenault, owner of the Transat Tourism Chairs at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza which will become a residence for elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects with a total of 600 rooms will be launched in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the sponge with failures in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear site in Amy's-North promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumatic Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1 137 that the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, productive recovery minister, had already announced this on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant’s purchase project in January, you’re back today.
You have spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of “so-called workers”, who “work three hours” a day, of “fool” syndicates, targeting the CGT.
I don’t understand that turning face.
Is this a good idea for Mr. Montgomery?
I am not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I am sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours disability France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
I have no prejudice to France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan so much need this factory?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with the right price and skilled workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good start compensation, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine Titan purchases the closed factory from Goodyear.
Thus, Titan could move machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Monsanto knows this.
But he wants to keep the factory of Amiens with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agreed to recruit them among the current 1,200 employees of Goodyear.
Also Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan's commitment before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear sign an agreement on starting compensation for all employees.
There will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting compensation.
If all employees accept them, the factory purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg achieves that CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan purchases the factory, we are planning to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier’s profits decrease while aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian air and rail manufacturer, a 15% drop in its net profits on Thursday, under pressure of a drop in aircraft orders and supplies during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has neither provided test data for its new CSeries aircraft nor information to determine whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious commercial launch schedule before September next.
After the initial flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the latter only flew three times, and then the question was whether the test phase was on the right way.
The results did not meet the forecasts and the stock price dropped by 8% at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, dropped its rating on Thursday, moving from “superperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential of stock exchange growth in the next quarter or in the next two quarters.
“Al the drop in aircraft supplies was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program advances.
However, if no new orders are announced over the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was revealed in March and flown for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of fixed orders for CSeries aircraft is modest so far at a height of 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company’s claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential of savings of the new aircraft.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchasing commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 fixed orders before the first aircraft is put into commercial service.
The leaders also assured the analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was moving forward according to the schedule.
“The test aircraft didn’t stay on the ground longer than planned,” Mr. Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft’s stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to go on a first flight and plan for an update period, and that’s what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly later, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer could fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry into service schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slowdown of flight trials – although it is apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our opinion that the entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter closed on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted action result remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue has slightly dropped from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world said it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 before.
The delay in the Air Force division was $32.9 billion on September 30, an unchanged figure compared to December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautique, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the small number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing,” said Mr. Beaudoin.
Airline’s revenue dropped by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, said that the division’s revenue had increased from 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book of the Transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The marges of the Transport division suffered problems with the execution of some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s stock price, which also announced that Google’s chief financial director Patrick Pichette would sit in the board of directors, dropped from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world and the closest competitor to Bombardier, announced Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profits.
Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 were carried missing in a hole under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, it was on Friday at the Speleo rescue of the Isère.
They were localized this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one struggling to practice and the other not, were left underground on Thursday around 21h30 to make a crossover of the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news about them since then, the same source said.
“The speleologists had to come out around 5 a.m. in the morning,” said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at the Speleo rescue responsible for the rescue organization.
Thousands of people on the site
Around twenty rescue workers, ten civilians, members of the French Spéléo rescue, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the site.
At the end of Friday afternoon, the two speleologists were localized.
"It's another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," Le Dauphiné explains.
The two soldiers at the 13th Alpine Hunters Battalion in Chambéry were found “exhausted, but not injured.”
They lost themselves in the network, returned on their steps while waiting for the rescue, the prefecture said.
Realised, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescue in the evening.
German journalists to escape Google and Yahoo
The German journalists syndicate called on its members to stop using Google and Yahoo’s online services on Thursday after new revelations about the activities of U.S. and UK intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends journalists to avoid using the search engines and messaging of Google and Yahoo up to a new order,” she said in a statement.
The Washington Post reports that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
“The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” added Michael Konken, chairman of the syndicate that claims 38,000 members.
Previous Post:Member Demands Brigitte Grouwels' Resignation
The minister Brigitte Grouwels’ project of “relifting” the polls of the signaling fires in Brussels doesn’t like everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project on Thursday at the centre of Brussels consisting of painting 16 polls of signaling fires of the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The objective is to both "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the future, to paint all Brussels signal fires, for an estimated cost of approximately one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark," according to Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock who talks about the "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "démission" of Brigitte Grouwels.
“It’s not pleased to foolishly spend the money of the Brussels in the operations of reliefing the colour signaling poles of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of flamandization of the Capital,” De Bock insists in a statement.
After her yellow-manga-black taxis, she finally painted herself in yellow-blue dark-black the Brussels pools.
According to the deputy, there is no “more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.”
The Brussels people deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who realizes the NVA program itself.
It is time to stop the Trojan Horse of Flanders.
“For reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of the Brussels!” concluded De Bock.
The port of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The ecotax port of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent protest of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on the site shortly after 10 p.m., and traffic over the national was distorted in the footsteps.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, managing the port.
It is the last of the three ecotax portics in the state of operation in the Finistère department, the other two have been dismantled or sabotaged.
Starting a Google Glass Accessory Store
A online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers possessing a prototype of Google signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a header, a charging machine, or even a storage plate.
This store, strictly reserved for developers already having Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a micro-fiber-made protective box or an intra-auricular header.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father was removed from the living world.
In the beginning I denied his death, I talked about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I’d continue to “frequent” it.
There is no recipe, no way of using to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awake in the full night to look at his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that was what I thought the day when I found his body empty, crisped on that hospital bed with cracked clothes.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the mild light of the candles that enclosed his cage.
I thought she was gone.
Slowly, by little day or night appearances, slightly shy, slightly deleted, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she was regaining her place in the landscape of my thought that believed to be sad.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had no way lost my mother’s person but just a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who incarnated that person, during his stay in life.
By dying, that woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I found her, full and full.
This tour of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, “in and out” he looks like.
I have always been told.
I never believed it at that time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he became old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was hurt...
He spoke to me, encouraged me constantly, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I borrowed my body to him.
But it was never indiscret.
I could have a personal life.
He left my privacy.
It lasted a long time and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and comforting to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don’t know who said that the dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they say, what would they think, what would they do?
I constantly dream of them, not every night but several times a week it’s sure.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it’s too late, only there’s always one thing that prevents me from achieving that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes some dreams lead me to the opposite and enter into my story and in fact, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed I was waking up, I was hanging out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the slope and he smiled and glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean me that he shared with joy what happened to me.
And, of course, it was a little boy in my stomach.
I loved to share this moment with him and I am delighted to tell this common memory lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died from cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
This is the shock that his disappearance caused at the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my sadness quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of becoming a master in a large school, have not been, with the backward, anodine choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talking about Morocco, where she had lived for decades – before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she inculcated me are always present, so that I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and righteousness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a kind soul, a salvation spirit.
I see his eyes put on me.
My mother died 19 years ago now.
He died after he spoke to me by phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that trigger themselves alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then the time calmed the pain.
It is only the lack, that emptiness without answer, that need for her, to trust me, to calm me in the hole of her sweetness.
However, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes put on me, I see the corners that stretch his eyes, the ridules around his lips that the cigarettes go, the plots that mark the forehead on the days of worriedness.
My mother took possession of my face and she looked at me every morning in my mirror.
Every morning I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We feel constantly his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his painful bed, so we gradually re-learned to smile, and saying his name is no longer a taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hole of the night when the absence is too painful, she invites herself into my dreams when morality is a little reached.
We feel drawn and protected in difficult moments, the back of time makes us realize how much she was orchestra leader and we try to stay in the way she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very strongly, the absence cannot remove you from the heart and memories.
In a certain way, the loved being becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from a consequence of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn’t see her inhumation and three weeks after her death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in accordance with his vision of things.
I also had trouble in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it’s impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don’t sleep and I always wonder what he will think about it.
I don’t know if I’ve adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
He is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
It was about thirty years that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and my son 6 years old.
The immense torment that invaded me then was, of course, relieved, but it is still close to me.
Very often it "drop" in my dreams in such a precise, so vivid way that when I wake up I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm down" but with a so real voice that I woke up over, anxious and I lighted the shelf lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I turn to see if he is not there, I know that he is and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave that house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I’m 58 years old, I’ve always lived alone since he left, it’s and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a job of responsibility, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October is the most bloody month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures: 964 people died last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will extend, and what is happening in Syria will extend as well.
And what happens when a terror virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Out of the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They broke pancards accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide assistance to him.
Cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was arrested
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to murderer Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed in the big day.
He was sentenced to a three-year prison sentence by the Liverpool Assisi Court.
A great defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the criminal Neil Scarbrough about investigations on his drug trafficking activities after being compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was called "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "first-important case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officials found 32-year-old Sarborough depositing three sacks of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he attended a Barroom dinner with colleagues.
Investigations have revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her portfolio and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to unlawfully obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation of heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were later imprisoned after the police captured heroin and cocaine for a amount of £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would not be revealed over the day.
Today, at the Liverpool court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors lawyer office located in Blackburn, has fallen into disgrace after being found guilty on two heads of accusation of obstacle to justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, found that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta’s home and placing the drug, purely 60 percent, under the lawyer’s waste in a black golf gloves.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant from the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her portfolio and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied consuming cocaine. He said he had talked to the alleged drug trafficking because it was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but all of them were captured and a sample of hair was taken.
During an interrogation, he said that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that it happened that clients called him home for legal issues.
But the court heard testimony that he called to major drug traffickers, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “If someone has to know that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trader, but a drug trader providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this has gone far beyond the usual limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He stopped the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but dishonored it.
He became too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he left his independence to compromise.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I't have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: “Mr. Ditta has passed from a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself as soon as he began buying drugs from criminal organizations.”
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backgrounds of the leaders of organized criminal groups who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of confidence among the public.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed that confidence and tried to hide behind the lakes of his profession.
Lancashire’s serious and organized crime unit has conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three chief accusations of possession of cocaine and now obstacles to justice, witnessing his commitment to prosecuting criminals in court.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough has been imprisoned for 14 years after allegedly accused of complicity of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/response session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the Corridor of Death in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin Returns to Scene in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the Queen of Soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board Hall of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin came to record an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without clarification of the disease she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were “hard.”
She says she’s happy to be back.
Menton Reduces Christmas Lighting Costs
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of sea coast covered with a light jacket: the heat blow in Menton could be broken with the lighting bill.
Fact that, unlike many communes, is also settled by taxpayers, not by traders’ associations.

But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at the international airport in Los Angeles.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to the police, at least two people were injured.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transport Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff went to the outputs or on the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical Songs for Teenagers
Every time it is the school client that will be targeted, an initiative that had experienced a lot of success during the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and interpreted by the artists of the region, vineyards containing a strong dose of humor, adolescents are allowed to admire the classic song.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes room full at the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving the chance to the artists of the region to show what they are capable of.
These activities were added to the Apéro lyrique, the concert-benefit held in August last year, with the contest of the soprano colorature Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a profit activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of The Mouse.
Without giving precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to show himself calming.
Despite the uncertainty that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more constant support.
“Finances are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will go through in seven years,” the administrator commented.
“I’d say even beyond,” added the chief executive, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child as a hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey is facing six heads of charges, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmery.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of kidnapping, seizure, prophesy of threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous intention, kidnapping, and failing to comply with a decree.
"The quick reactions of the police involved and their ability to immediately dismantle the situation were essential to the security conclusion of this incident," Captain Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in prison and must appear in court on Friday.
Request for collective appeal against the Sainte-Croix Brothers
A new collective appeal has been filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual aggression that would have occurred this time at St. Joseph's oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the witness of the applicant, identified as "J.J." who would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor the brother Soumis, then by his confessor, father Bernard, at the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was serving a messe and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed only at three establishments, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us, "I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has for particularity to allow the addition of complaints from any establishment where violations could have been committed by members of the Congregation of St. Cross.
Currently, the appeal gathers the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as several of the establishments targeted closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasizes that the Congregation of St. Cross and the Oratory of St. Joseph, which is a distinctive entity, “allowed sexual harassment against children”, that they “exercited a moral, religious and psychological burden on the victims”, that they “were aware of the sexual harassment that was committed and yet drowned them”, and that they “consciously and consciously chose to ignore the problematics”.
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the investigations made in the archives about this by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the violations.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of receivability in the Supreme Court.
Once the receivability has been admitted by the Court, the second step, i.e. the hearing on the basis, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle to the friendly before hearing was conducted on the ground.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in LaSalle district, Montreal, in the night of Thursday to Friday.
The rescue was called around 1 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had been declared in the underground of an Indian cuisine restaurant on the Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with the Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were sent to the site took about an hour to control the bridge.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injured, but twenty houses, located in the first and second floors of this line of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily housed, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical aid to die at the palliative care congress
The Canadian palliative care congress, which takes place this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote for the principle of a bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to calm their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would like to end their days, according to a spokesman for the Canadian Association for Palliative Care, Maryse Bouvette.
If we were focusing on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The chairman of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she regrets.
The majority of palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance of palliative care houses vice president, Suzanne Fitzback.
Fitzback, also director of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be in any way useless.
They never ask us, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disoriented the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will take the step.
On its side, Gatineau’s liberal deputy, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the concept of life end will need to be clarified before the draft law is adopted.
Kenya's press is angry with controversial media law
“It’s a scary country and it’s legitimate to ask yourself the following question: what will prevent the Parliament from shrinking the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” the newspaper said, contesting the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconic and very punitive, and we refuse it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said the new media court “will always be partial because it is a government extension” and that content and advertising restrictions would harm Kenya’s place in the world economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliament,” he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new draft law will allow the government to have “the mainstream on the media.”The Standard, in turn, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “have suffered a hard blow” and fused the draft law calling it “drakonian.”
The draft law is being adopted in the same time as a line of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping center in September last year.
The Kenya media has raised the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack were allegedly stealing the so-called luxury shopping center.
Police chief, David Kimaiyo, reacted by calling two journalists and a media manager to interrogate them, although the call was withdrawn after a shield in the media.
According to the new bill, the media will be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “released” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of a counterfeit if the counterfeit has not paid his penalty.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one penalty is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the “animated blogosphere” of Kenya.
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do whatever they want in impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of control in public life.
“Ded to themselves, the politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and bring us back to hunting and gathering.”
The Kenyan legislators have been the target of the people’s anger in the past.
In May, they took a position against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their mirobolant wages of approximately 532 000 shillings per month tax-free – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists.
The departure of 10 pharmacists at Laval’s Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) caused a whole excitement to the management of the Hospital of the City of Health, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement, maternity holidays or short retirement, the pharmacy department found itself a great deficit in staff.
Nearly 30% of the staff needed was missing, making this financial year “very difficult,” according to department chief, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
We did not use the problem, said Mrs. Beaudet.
We have rationalized or decreased some of our activities within the establishment to palliate, the time that things go back.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people [residents in the pharmacy] so that they come and stay here.
There was a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the 2013-2014 year is announced to be significantly easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired over the past months.
In addition, the efforts deployed by the department to retain have brought fruits, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to stay at the employment of the CSSS.
It’s going much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill out our last year's starts.
The increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in the hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have a medium that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always run at three maternity holidays when it goes well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we have no pharmacists that are available to make replacement so it was more difficult.
The top 22-year-old model doesn’t start his career in cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier has chosen her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (the 1st and 8th of January 2014), brings up the erotic memories of a four-year-old sex-related woman since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to his elderly is impressive: a brindle silhouette, a diaphane colour and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of the risk: the one who did not hesitate to put naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulfuric situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the Net: Stacy Martin appears on the bed and in full extase with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their pudding in the closet, he applied to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing her actresses in their last drawings, always for the best.
Stacy Martin has not stopped talking about her.
A CGR room in Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, by precautions, as a result of throat swelling felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the head of the facility made the evacuation of the room and warned the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a complete recognition of the room gave nothing.
A bad joke on the background of a lacrymogenic jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that the film management has played the principle of caution and safety of its customers in depth.
The room was aired and everything went back in order.
The cinema has been able to recover its rights and customers have been able to recover the pleasure of the images.
Only on the screen.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into crabs
Enjoying the Halloween day, a woman tried to bring into the country two kilograms of cocaine hidden in cracks, Thursday morning, at the Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger’s luggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine was divided into three rubles that were previously empty.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Gendarmery of Canada (GRC), which took the relay in this investigation.
The Canadian Border Service Agency (ASFC) has not revealed where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokeswoman for ASFC.
What I can tell you is that it came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services agents at the Montreal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, the border services of the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 narcotic trafficking.
Air strike against military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early afternoon, but the attacks took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 ground-air missiles had been targeted and destroyed.
This new Tsahal airstrike on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances approximately identical to the one that had occurred on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous U.S. official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont submarine missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation of seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered on Friday the solvency rating of Ukraine, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country’s public debt securities goes to “B-”, falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be down again in a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy enables to guarantee sufficient foreign currencies to meet its high external financing needs,” the U.S. agency explains.
The agency notes that the foreign exchange reserves of Ukraine fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This makes it difficult to refund the loans taken abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities are using massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency is increasingly likely to have a devaluation, which would boost its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying a bill of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, angry with Kiev’s will to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country’s economy had suffered between July and September its fifth quarter in a row of contraction.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to be 33,5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budget deficit, has been demanding for months the aid from the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it a credit of $15.3 billion in 2010 and for now has unlocked only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new shares as long as the country has not adopted impopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new failure mission in the country, the IMF found this week that “important external financing needs” were “a vulnerability,” while releasing “signs of economic improvement.”
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, “there cannot be expected a short-term improvement.”
"There is little hope that impopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections are scheduled for 2015, the expert said, interrogated by AFP.
The only hope is to improve the international situation.
S&P also highlights the "incertitude" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditiones the release of opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Signing the deal would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's response," S&P said, which is afraid of "commercial restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in case of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. Green Fire to Publicis-Omnicom Fusion
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they did not receive any objection from the U.S. authorities to their merger, approaching the creation of the world’s first advertising agency.
The fusion is closer to the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups announced in a statement.
They have also received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period provided by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other courts meet several of the conditions necessary for the execution of the transaction.
“The merger is also conditioned by the obtaining of other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups,” they add.
Congolese army catches M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units will pursue the M23 rebels to their bases located in the forests and mountains of the neighboring northern Kivu of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears about to be hit after being thrown out of locations in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC) which it controlled since the start, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
“We’re going to pursue the M23 and capture it everywhere it’s hidden because it’s criminals,” Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for the FARDC, told Reuters.
We should not let them reorganize because they have martyrized the people of the Congo for too long.
It is time to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they evacuated the locations under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military reverses would not change their claims to peace talks.
The latter, according to Uganda mediators, took back on Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Clashes are in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last place in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion took place in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of the northern Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garnison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world’s most important in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a fast-intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
On its side, the major state of the FARDC was replaced and the army passed to the offensive against the M23, making the course of the war change.
The pace of government troops is now unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be touching its end,” Congolese affairs expert Jason Stearns predicts on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government succeeds to beat a major insurrection.
And this is also the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda will be present in the east of the DPRK.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it sharply, of military support for the M23, formed by former mutinated Congolese soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame to demonstrate retention, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said.
Last week, Kigali had talked about the possibility of military repressions following the bombs that fell into Rwanda's territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the town to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
“We’ve lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable for us to be released by the army one day,” a resident of this neighboring town of Uganda testifies.
“We’ve lived in terror (of the M23), we’re traumatized,” the man added.
The tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He said that “the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two cases confirmed in France so far.”
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old was suspected to have been hit, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused about fifty deaths.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, on Friday a decrease in its quarterly profits due to the decrease in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in retreat from the group’s goals.
Its third-quarter net profit decreased to $4.95 billion, $2.57 per share, against $5.25 billion, $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters were on average $2.71 per share profit.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, an increase compared to 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% growth of production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its Liquid Natural Gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment spending increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities dropped slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) dropped from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, said on Thursday that its net profit is falling, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School Transport: the complaint considered acceptable
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year fees of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transport to two residents, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
“There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested,” said Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and asked for an additional time to consider it.
“It’s always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions,” says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only indicated that mediation is part of the process when a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu emergencies
In the face of the front carried out for several months by a portion of staff and several syndicates, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "descalate the implementation calendar of the project, and in particular the closing date of the emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4".
A request officially made "to not run any risk on taking care of the emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which also aimed at not disturbing the PS campaign to a few months of the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective at that date.
Although, in APHP, it is preferable to use the term "transformation" or "changing in continuity".
As of November 4, the firefighters—who provided approximately a quarter of the 40,000 annual passes to the Hotel-Dieu emergencies—all will have received an order to take the thirty serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of the internates.
In the Hotel-Dieu, emergency specialists will leave place on Monday to five general medical facilities.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
“The Hotel-Dieu emergency welfare service must be closed as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4th,” said Loïc Capron, the chairman of the APHP Medical Institution Commission (CME), who supports the management’s project.
“On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means,” says Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency," he tempers, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on the site to transfer the serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on the site, he also assures.
But it is the ARS’s responsibility to decide the closure of the emergency service.
“Things are going progressively,” said Nicolas Péju, the ARS spokesman for whom on November 4th, “there will be no change in terms of service rendered.”
“The minister has lied to us or we’ve been lying to him,” the emergency doctor Gerald Kierzek regrets.
Removed from his post as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the front against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warner" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology".
“They are emptying and asphyxing the emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he says.
For him, "if other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
They are regularly engraved.
There are, for example, nine hours of waiting for the emergencies of Lariboisière.
In the ARS, it is claimed that thirty patients "dispatched" on several sites are not at risk of representing a "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
In both the ARS and the APHP, we are defending the “new hospital model” already launched since October 7 and which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist doctors should also come to participate in the establishment of a “permanent ambulatory care.”
“Where are we going if people are asked to self-diagnose,” asks Gerald Kierzek for whom “the no serious emergency concept” is “dangerous” and marks a “medical regression.”
This will be the same as for maternity level 3.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take measures by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the framework of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, UMP counsel of Paris and elected from the 4th district, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again reminded Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that was the case, she would mark her clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the foundation, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of delay to other hospitals.
Obama ends hearing to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end the hearing on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to take back the hand in the NSA hearing case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and the World Bank’s surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the issue, a U.S. administration official replied: “The U.S. does not carry out electronic surveillance targeting the World Bank and IMF seats in Washington.”
Speaking under the sign of anonymity, the official did not specify if such surveillance had been implemented in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had given an order to stop these practices over the past weeks.
This instruction was given approximately at the same time as the one ending the hearing at the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved a reinforcement of controls on government surveillance programs on Thursday but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the retention of such information.
The UN welcomes the new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new series of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the “Sustainable Development Goals” intended to replace the WTOs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit that began last night in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final pre-project of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “exceed national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adopt the process aimed at setting Universal Sustainable Development Goals,” he added.
These ODDs will be based on the progress achieved in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my best to fulfill the mandate that has been entrusted to me by the Member States to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that are based on the success of the WTOs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing while conflicts arise between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scand peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a tee-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been daily reports reporting conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo, the worst hangs since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebellion movement, initially supported by the Rhodesia governed by the white and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shocked foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of enormous offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other the responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is the source of recent confrontations and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels degenerated when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill the group's leader Afonso Dhlakama and Renamo's spokesman Fernando Mazanga, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza said on Wednesday to AFP, the French news agency, that Dhlakama considered himself a "loss" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist to say they both want to avoid the war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to take the negotiations back, but with the greatest seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm the tensions driven by a series of conflicts this year.
“There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don’t stop fighting,” said Joseph Hanlon, a speaker at the Open University and specialist in Mozambique.
No one of them can negotiate well and no one of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to get concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of the votes collected by the Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain a greater number of votes in the election.
Mr. Mazanga said Mr. Guebuza – who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not exactly known what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disturbing lightning attacks on police offices and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where it is Beira, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations that the government causes, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also worried about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the leaders of the country’s future are the government and the president, and that it is on the latter to find solutions to the problems,” he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said people wanted stability.
“No one is concerned about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “life-style patterns,” the author says.
Thor’s Legend might show that “brutal force does not weigh against subtle rush,” while Arthur’s legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught in school,” Crossley-Holland suggested a “precient selection” of works adapted to age.
“I find it great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been supporting this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “completely disappear” and the messages are “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Per the great difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or ends well, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The knowledge of what is shown and what is not said.
One Hamas fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by a Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they shoot a bus from an Israeli blind.
NSA spying: the U.S. is “going too far,” Kerry admitted
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, State Secretary John Kerry recognised in this first confession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, disclosures and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I admit that, as the president did, some of these actions have gone too far and we’ll make sure that this doesn’t happen in the future,” John Kerry said at a London conference at which he participated since Washington on Thursday, October 31 via video link.
In his broadcast intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of the U.S. diplomacy has long justified the intelligence and information collection practices by the necessary anti-terrorist struggle and the prevention of possible attacks.
Calling on the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and the attacks of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities have since disguised many attacks projects, through interception of communications and information collection.
“We have actually prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects in advance,” the head of the U.S. diplomacy said.
And, John Kerry said to Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been misleading."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," the Secretary of State said, who had already had to speak about this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was going to review these practices so that no one feels wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to flourish this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted the data of hundreds of millions of users from Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program called "MUSCULAR", and led with the British NSA homologist, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fiber used by the internet giants.
According to one of the documents, about 181 million items were collected during the month of January - from metadata on emails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions will take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA had massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while flights in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. president was not aware of such hearing, Barack Obama refused to speak about it, invoking national security.
The head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the ball to the European intelligence services who would be seized of these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would absolutely not target Europe, General Alexander said.
The controversy spread in Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has called the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of an extensive international spy network that has also raised the wrath of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his asset master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the League 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, the leader of the championship against Monaco at the difference of goals, has broadcast the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply indicates that he was “sick,” without specify the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered an inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection, at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the crematised dead
The Crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the crematised dead in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the city of Paris, must attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her proposals on the funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose crema, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funerals of a close, it is the opposite: the French prefer inhumation (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose the creation.
In his book The Death in the Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, insists on the “violence” that creation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with the creation, “a violence made to the beloved body,” which will be “reduced to a lot of sand” in very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which “will accompany the phases of sadness.”
There is also a “symbolic violence”, which concerns the “release of singularity and distinctive signs” reduced to the “anonymity” of the ash.
Why is what is hardly accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
“Because creation is a new fact,” says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, chairman of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approving Death.
It is only tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited the attempts to acquire it.
It is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that he would have the right to with an inhumation.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a creme wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers want it as well.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
“For a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of a wait for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the submission of the ash,” says Michaud-Nerard.
70% of the establishments now offer ceremonial masters, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to link him to others, to mention him, to give sense to his death, to organize the farewell.
This is the case in the Crematorium of Father Lachaise, since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted themselves.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the Day of La Toussaint, several memorial ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who have been crematised in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is transmitted online, to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The Crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relocation due to rats turns into controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the emergency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office proposed, in an exceptional and provisional way, to relocate the couple and their three children into a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the head of the office.
There have always been rats in the cities.
The deratization company performs two passages per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our charge, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last year, we have performed 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats do not pull into the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we will not kill a boy.
“We haven’t invited the rats to our house,” the family father defends himself who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the money and we are waiting for a new housing, at the same price as the old.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Ends Falling by 0.88%
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The ratio has suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, harmful to export values and the warning on its annual outcome launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201,57 and the Topix ceded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183,03.
Sony has fallen from more than 11% to 1.668 yens.
A house stuck with flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were sent to the 9th Hebert Street.
The flames were in a four-storey three-storey house behind the Quebec Seminary Court.
All the locators were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the firefighters arrived, which were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it took strength to attack the building, because it's buildings hanged here," said France Loiselle, spokesman for the firefighters of Quebec.
Investigations are ongoing to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the Vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly before the audience, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation continued over the years, until it was more recently reprised by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of the poster heads have emerged in the Carolines, and have experienced great success, until they have become too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue to work with them.
This year’s event will include the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes”, a comedy and music evening in favour of the former fighters, held at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took extent, just as the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year’s festival have passed through non-traditional circuits, presenting for example shows on small TV channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the theme of the joyfully lascif football fantasy of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the Saturday Night Live show and was part of the casting of the series Parks and Recreation, but she is still more famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a unique voice (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a accomplished film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he directed a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hotel in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and said Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I’m going to live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and approach $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the importance of stocks compensate a report showing that the Chinese electricity manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The U.S. reference gross price for delivery in December dropped from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late morning in Europe during electronic exchanges at the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weakened the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supply increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show an activity growth, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rose to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent, a reference for the international brut already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
The right to abortion in Texas
A federal appeal court has restored in Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy that had been blocked by a first instance judge this week.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The appeal court’s ruling means that doctors who will practice IVG will have to have a “admission privilege” at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, in accordance with his status as a caring member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical center in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
The advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law risks to result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state clinics as these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a first-instance judge had judged in advance of the entry into force of the law that the provisions concerning the admission privilege were anticonstitutional.
But the General Attorney of Texas, the Republican Greg Abbott, who strikes the post of governor, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the first instance judgment that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary meeting on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a back in force, side audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV post, or 5.6% of the audience.
Was the show at the date?
Around 10,000 candidates presented themselves to the hearing of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, the viewers shared their comments.
After passing the excitement to find their favorite program, many were disappointed.
Why so much disappointment?
No candidate actually appears to have marked at this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows a wide selection of herb singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even have gone to the end.
Behind the TV screens, successful singer vocations are still there, season after season.
Others have just the ambition to make them laugh.
The court blocked a decision regarding the NYPD control and investigation policy
A federal appeal court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision requiring changes in the New York Police Department's control and investigation program and removed it from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (second circuit) said that the judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the appeal brought by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program aimed at controlling and interrogating citizens.
The city appealed for its conclusions and its corrective orders, including a decision to assign an inspector to help the police department to change its policy and the training program that is associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments concerning the request for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the court should be withdrawn from the case because it violated the judge’s code of conduct by compromitting the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which it publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The court ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by misleading black men and men of Spanish origin as part of their control and detection program.
She has appointed an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the implementation of a pilot program to test the camera carried on the body in the neighborhoods where the most controls are carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice consisting of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the call requested by the city is expected to take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of control and detection have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and detection system has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of recorded controls has increased spectacularly under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and has become a collective action.
The supporters who advocate changes in the NYPD’s control and investigation program say they will end unfair practices, allow to have more efficient and trusted police forces, and will be able to change the way the police departments use the policy.
Opponents say that these changes would minimize the police morality without decreasing crime, would represent a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police personnel were severely reduced over the last decade.
The judge emphasized that it did not end the control and investigation practices, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Renters must go to vote, because each of them pay an average of $100 per month on the price of the housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each housing.
We are required to increase rent to help us pay new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change the situation in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would deal with the scandal debt.
We no longer have the means to pay ourselves for fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 to $5 million for the event...
Go to vote, it’s the best way to express yourself and say that it’s enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
In the 500 m2 of the elysée cuisine as committed after working in ambassades, the chef grew all the stages until becoming chef, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holidays, and fed a countless number of great people in this world in a quasi-anonymity that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at the age of 60.
The man with open face, scratched neck and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is the owner of a CAP of breeding.
Her mother was a cook in a castle in Sologne.
“I’ve passed from one castle to another!” ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for which he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It’s always the head of the state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus,” he reminds.
“Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen,” to the point that she had banned women in the Elysée cuisine!
Not to dislike the heads of state who showed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, “they are all gourmands,” Bernard Vaussion gently denounces.
Jacques Chirac had "a slightly more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the tables returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who returned the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has no "specific regime request".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners in Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are errors.
The former chef of the Elysée cuisine, who took a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, goes with a heartbeat."François Hollande came to greet me.
He said praises.
“His human side has gone out,” he says.
He will be replaced by his 35-year-old adjunct, Guillaume Gomez, who has been in Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was caught by flames in Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The four-housing building, located on the 15th Hebert Street, was subject to three alarms at the fire service.
The fire declined in front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokesman for the Fire Protection Service in Quebec, said the firefighters’ rapid intervention has prevented the spread of flames to the adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where the buildings are built closely.
The fire house had four homes, but no tenants were on the site at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
A investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the sappers have excluded the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: The Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese leaves a few images out of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is carried out by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will take you off in his role as a disappointed trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a “Long Island Stock Exchange Count, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities as part of a large corruption case in Wall Street.”
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then raises a fraud that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascension, but also the vertigineous fall that will follow.
Without limits, man boasts the holidays, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess in all kinds are the master words of this mad story.
The couple Scorsese-DiCaprio appears to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
The film will last at 2:45.
On December 25 he will be able to take part in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tube
News of the World’s former chief editor Andy Coulson would have used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a bullying tube on a link involving then in practice Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said before the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her “beautiful special adviser.”
It was to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby’s vocal box and “plant constantly in front of his door,” but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
“The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the chief editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the house of people hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three means to investigate the subjects: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The chief editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Do you know about phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say “Naturally yes.”
The rumors about a connection involving Clarke were first taken by NotW’s editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Mrs. Pawlby, said that she had been told, “Don’t waste your time with her, she’s with Charles.”
A band, on which had recorded hacked voice messages on her phone at least three times, was recorded at Mulcaire’s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found files on the private detective’s computer concerning Mrs. Pawlby and her sister ranked in a “Projects” file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Mrs. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about her, Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Mrs. Pawlby’s minor facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow which I really would like to talk to Charles.”
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had faced Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended co-defense Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted they have performed telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister in full flame of violence
The President of the United States had to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq was in October its deadliest month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by Iraqi authorities.
964 people were killed in the October violence, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The U.N. has given an even higher figure with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence are increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and large military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
Approximately two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence makes fear of a new burst as neighboring Syria is in a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot down on the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has favoured this flame of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, a day after the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car trapped north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri al-Maliki wants a “world war” against al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the heart of the U.S. talks with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki which will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. president, elected on the promise to end the military engagement in this country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and Congress elected.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to conduct a "third world war" against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic Senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing him the partial responsibility for the recovery of violence through his “sectarian and authority policy.”
They also called on Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “the damaging influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relations.”
Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
China's head of internal security accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang on Friday of being behind the car attack that killed five people on the Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, hit the crowd that was on the famous Chinese capital square, symbol of the 1989 murderous repression, and took fire killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security matters, accused the Islamic movement in East Turkestan of being the inducer of the attack.
Many Uighur, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there animated by independentist claims.
“The violent terrorist incident that happened in Beijing has been organized and predicted,” Meng told Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV.
“The group that stood in the background was the Islamic movement in the eastern Turkestan,” he added, adding his statements by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uighur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with fuel and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident caused 42 injured.
The Islamic movement in East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican survey on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive dossiers such as contraception, divorce and couples formed from people of the same sex.
The survey asks the participants how priests take care of gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the marriage bonds.
The survey was sent in the middle of October to each national bishops conference, with the instructions to obtain as many answers as possible.
The information will serve to an important family gathering that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to investigate the parishmen.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army attacks the last fief of rebels
The irreductibles of the M23, or a few hundred fighters, were scattered at 2,000 meters high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two locations located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the northern Kivu province.
"It has not ceased since this morning, the struggles continue despite the night," a resident of Jomba told AFP, who was contacted by telephone around 12:30 and according to which a girl was wounded by a shot in the morning.
“The intensity of the struggles has decreased a little,” he added, “it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have rejected the rebels a little.”
According to the witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before climbing to the front for a "rating operation".
It was very clear that behind him were nourishes of light weapons.
From Bunagana, the political fief and the last strong spot of the rebellion falling on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons explosions.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered “in a final phase,” the FARDC has “circled the remaining M23 positions to displace them.”
Since the resumption, Friday, of the confrontations between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco has not participated directly in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support in the fields of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well-equipped with ammunition, climbed towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalachnikov and missiles.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, post-border with Uganda, civilians-helped soldiers charged a multiple rocket launched on a flaming new FARDC truck, to ensure the lift of another machine piling the positions of the M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday evening again called on the rebels to "voluntaryly demobilize" under punishment of being disarmed "by force", but left open the process of Kampala, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without a result for now.
On the site, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
“We’ve finished the talks, it’s left only to the Uganda mediation to organize the signature,” said Roger Lumbala, Deputy Chairman of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately by the government.
The M23 was born from a mutinery, in April 2012, of former rebels, mostly tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala reject.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its underground is filled with desirable mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people were refugees between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the return movement to the DRC that had started in the morning turned to the middle of the day.
"Today morning we went back to go to our fields, but the military told us to go back," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on the back, told AFP.
There is the impression that the shootings are getting closer to the people.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of inhabitants crossed the border, some with a mattress on the head, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions singed and danced take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the musical in French affirms itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame of Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts stopped in ridicule.
And successes such as Cabaret or the Misérables brought the auréole of the mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at the Châtelet and Stage-Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as successful tubes.
The first takes back, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the world creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could be one of the successes of the season.
On other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "The Bastille Lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" put themselves at the diapason of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histories of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Châtelet Theatre, analyzes the reasons for the success so hardly conquered.
How do French music comedies evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First, there are the “musical shows” that evolve according to the will of the producers.
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a jump of fifteen years back under the pretext that you can serve almost anything when you have Matt Pokora in the head of the poster.
Afterwards, we have the musical comedies with the magnificent productions of the Châtelet that make us revive the Golden Age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage ­Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French manufacturers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as “Rent”, “The Kiss of the Spider Woman” or “The Spring Awakening” are hard to be funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the basement of musical comedy, it’s very different.
Young people are trained for these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The living of talents is as consistent as the number of positions to provide.
Why are tourists in the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatrical pieces go to tour and it’s often the boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill this shortage.
It’s the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as epidemic stars.
Proposing beautiful young men (sometimes talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of an enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their whole family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zénith province.
The mayonnaise was raised in Paris and tasted by the provinces.
The show is designed to enter all major halls in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring in Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at 5:30 p.m. on the interior ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart height, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is impun to him.
The ring was closed to the traffic, until 9:00 p.m., at the place of the accident, the time when the road is deblayed and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, has not caused much confusion as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be deviated by this output/input of the ring.
Child injured in Disneyland Paris attraction
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His life forecast is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It was closed until a new order.
DRC: Army is preparing a new attack
Children play on a carbonized blind that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in the east of the DPRK.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the east of the DRC.
The objective is to remove the M23 from the hills that look over Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the Bugina hill, which looks over the Mbuzi hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from itself.
There will be only the hill of Runyonyi.
"The one of Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Paluku plans to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Fief political and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located at the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was recovered by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreductibles have been removed at 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had struggles near Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "calm since this morning."
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the struggles of the previous day and were buried.
One girl was wounded by a shot, and three others were wounded, including a seriously evacuated by the FARDC, the witness added cited by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the fighting between the FARDC and the rebels on October 25, the two fighters did not report any loss of human lives.
NSA reveals increases company paranoia with regard to state surveillance
In a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. front post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explains that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of hearing antennas and that the operation caused an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. intelligence services, again insisted in September on the fact that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “stolen the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant becoming the denonciator, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on speech.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spy the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage services providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused the company’s paranoia with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, even for a decade, was the drop of water that made the vase overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made transparent the intense collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I believe it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
“Germany has to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, Chairman of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States represents a risks as significant as China when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY advisory office.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates so far that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets of foreign companies to U.S. companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the idea that the EU does not have sufficient computer and internet capabilities and believe it should endeavour to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German parliament member says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German corporate software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock for some companies who so far thought China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have realized that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10 percent of non-American members have renounced their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after the revelations on the U.S. data exploration program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: “Our customers ask us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee me that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at any price.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There has always been there.
“It’s a repeated topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed as part of the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level just as we are spying on them, because it is in national interest to defend our.
Business managers are generally unlikely to reveal the preventive measures they have implemented, in the event that this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long martelled the message that it is at least imprudent to recover a free USB key at a professional salon or to leave a portable computer without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi car manufacturer, says that collecting cell phones before the board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, is a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when they travel abroad due to the risk of infringing the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies about the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of carrying out acts of hacking economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying their allies.”
The parents of a Georgian teenager who died in unusual circumstances think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a rolled fighting carpet in his high school gym, think their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a tapet standing behind the grades of his high school.
Investigators of the County Sheriff of Lowndes concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family complains these findings.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representative Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as it is indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff.
“They think that it challenges any logic, the laws of physics and the common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were made for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a wallet and they gave him in a mortal bag,” he added.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation on Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a crime?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was dead from “positive asphyxia.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he reveals evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation on Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the office of the Sheriff of the County of Lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to submit all the videos of surveillance that the investigators had reviewed.
The teenage’s parents said they hoped that the videos contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
On Wednesday, the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines indicating how to manage children's food allergies in school.
This is the first series of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has greatly risen.
Today, one in 20 children in the United States suffer from food allergies.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools about how to raise the teaching body and staff awareness of food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen brand self-injector – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislative assemblies have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of the typical symptoms by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something gets my tongue,” “I feel like I’m having a hair on the tongue,” or “I feel like something gets my tongue,” or “I feel like I’m having a hair on the tongue.”
The NSA case highlights the total absence of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand blows in public by calling the U.S. Ambassador on 21 October, and on the other prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumor of Edward Snowden’s presence on his board?
I think there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the U.S. Ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is that of the scale of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World at a few weeks intervals, on the one hand, the reproduction of the U.S. diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand, a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn’t there be such a vague hypocrisy from your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that enables each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by the U.S. diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we in fact consider that, in view of the U.S. power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe the U.S. interception systems against the French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to anger us of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we stop American cooperation?
The implementation in the last ten years of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In addition, in this field, France and the United States in particular have implemented cooperation and information exchange procedures almost daily and which are described as essential on both sides.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was to the French through the NSA.
France can be conducted, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to the U.S. services, and, in return - it has already been said quickly - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA case is not so much the capacity or the right of the countries to equip themselves with interceptive tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, within the Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be their, and, in the end, the question of violations of freedoms.
What are the risks of the United States? a degradation of their image?
Even if they are denounced, I don’t see how they can be punished.
The risk of the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies – and that has been the case recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been stretched.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies reject, in the light of revelations, to trust their confidential data to U.S. service providers subject to U.S. laws, and thus to the NSA’s control.
The latter: the widespread disclosure movement engaged by the media around the world, which contributes to trigger a debate on the practices of surveillance of intelligence services until then almost inexistent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose ‘indetermined sex’
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for babies born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female gender of the newborn will no longer be attributed, rigidly, to the birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the gender of their child, allowing them to register an “undefined” or “undefined” gender on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure that weighed on the shoulders of parents who could make urgent decisions regarding a sexual reassignment surgery for their baby, and to fight against discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I’m going to remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, confused and cracked.
It is estimated that one in two thousand children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, intersexuality belonging to the group of seventy diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonades (ovars or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a sexual identification specialist, said the new German law “looking to be a good idea.”
Intersex children have an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but that’s not the case with most children,” he added.
It is possible to do a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science that consists in how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It is like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to gender but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and is not clearly defined as being either one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, pilosity, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-motivated crimes.
Young boys of non-conform gender now have camps that are specifically intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third-sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal that allowed her to keep "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F-X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still subject to controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for the "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American site Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that “as the world is trapped into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are broken down.”
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at their birth.
“The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And just a dozen years ago, the medical community regarded the genre as an ardoise, which can be deleted and on which it can be re-designed.
But now many are those who question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignation when he grows.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn’t call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children provided with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, from Johns-Hopkins University, who considered that gender is malicious.
He dedicated the term “sex identity” and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a blurred circumcision to cast him completely, also removing his testicles, and raise him like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
At about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38 he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “always repeat this model.”
But in the 1990s with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these transactions of gender change say “[that] they are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really say if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he suffered a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he found was scary.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and was removed from his breasts.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, chief executive of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law “invites to labelling and stigmatising.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their children an ‘undefined’ sex,” she said.
We fear that it encourages interventions.
We think it would be better to attribute a male or female sex, and wait.
But we haven’t seen what the law was going to give, so we can only advance the hypotheses.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the term third sex."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
The German law relates to the attribution of gender to birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
As they grow, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will “responsive” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called the full androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagin, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and internate in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or carrier mothers.
“The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so that they don’t have to make hurry decisions,” Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do certain tests and to understand them, and a time before registering “man” or “female”.
So, everything goes well – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don’t have to rush for an irreversible surgery.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they’re afraid not to do what should be done,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that’s something fantastic.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will remain until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the coalition at the approaching of the Senate’s vote to dismiss Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the center-left leader says he has "closed the intention" to continue to govern with his coalition until the upcoming 2015 legislative elections.
The Italian parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide the fate of the former Council president convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, proclaims his withdrawal.
But a part of his camp, gathered around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 his refusal to surrender to the orders of Berlusconi who already wanted to break down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transport Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the shooting exchange.
Firefighters called to the scene of the tragedy said they had responded to a call reporting "multiple injured".
"The police are on the site," the airport said on its Twitter account, while the TV images showed people evacuated in ambulance.
“There was a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed a person being evacuated on a brick and a second carried on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred around 9:30 local (12:30 in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the 2nd and 3rd squares are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately if one of his employees was injured.
All flights at arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli military kills a member of Hamas in Gaza
Israeli tanks shot dead a Palestinian Islamist activist from Hamas on Thursday and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to sources from health services.
A source from Hamas explained that struggles broke out in the region because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by the Palestinian killers.
The Israeli army has just mentioned a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Jewish state, coveted at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered leaving Biden down for Hillary Clinton
The closest adviser to President Barack Obama considered, in the greatest secret, to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event that is listed in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s 2012 campaign book, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the president’s close collaborators had conducted “deep-group work and polls at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s expulsion could help Obama with his re-election while his hopes were down.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the high leaders of the campaign and the White House, namely former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, aiming to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice President by the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of a exchange is a secret that has been hardly kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close presidential counselors – including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina and former White House counselors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was being studied.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "tough personal links", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "not significantly improves Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that moment, the president was not in shape, and so we were saying, “Lord, what can we do?”
While Daley described the review as “coordinated,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
“The campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on surveys and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known if Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible removal.
Although Daley said he didn't think that the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not respond in a definitive way to the question of whether political surveys had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn’t know that Biden’s removal from the presidential list was examined.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first fluorescent ice based on medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a bright snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on meduses and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate bright protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, as the ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more it lacks, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, said: “It’s something incredible but we’re just at the start in terms of production, and 2 g of this piece costs about £200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with pH neutral language.
So when your mouth heats the protein, the pH level increases and the ice begins to shine.
We’ve tried it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice I’ve created because the luminosity of the meduses is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs about £140.
But it has a pretty good taste!
Charlie’s experimental approach company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual ice smells such as beer, cheese, beef and golden leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, “I really would like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do so.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Tai Chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning, while watching the trees and performing the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands as a musician breaking the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a Tai Chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised to her husband, a week before her death, to take him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual home.
“He was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and the beauty of the world will transmit to many the great joy of living he had,” she added.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant in May.
Halloween 2013: in figures
When I was a child, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
I’ve become more ping.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single sweets and I will not do it anymore this year.
But the statistics show that I am the wicked sheep when we talk about Halloween.
Most Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I’m looking forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
The costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the unanimated sexy objects make anger.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the Daft Punk space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought out costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I think it’s not easy to stay traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
There are a lot of dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t glandulate.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on sweets this year, according to the Nielsen cabinet.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, juices, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a super news for the 41 million children who go for sweets in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, don’t tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn sweets are the only thing you don’t want to eat; and yet almost 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This is about 9 billion corn grains.
This is a mystery that I have not yet revealed.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the hunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is actually a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognised hunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million of recipes, according to America Haunts, and this includes these fantastic photos of you pissing on what your friends put on Facebook and you can’t remove and on which a guy you like well leaves a comment of the style “beautiful head”.
Finally, let’s talk about cracks.
Charlie Brown presented us The Great Cinderella when we were young, and sculpting a candlestick-shaped cinderella is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve done since we’ve been small.
Fortunately for us, the “baby-clock trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pets and didn’t have to sit there.

Royal Bank of Scotland will internally create a bankruptcy structure ("bad bank") which collects £38 billion ($45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure aimed at relaxing its relations with London and accelerating its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% over the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it over the next three years.
RBS also said it would sign a provision for the devaluation of doubtful claims additional four to 4.5 billion pounds per quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonation structure.
RBS also said that this internal restructuring would release 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its capacity to borrow.
The bank and London have emphasized that the “bad bank” would allow to draw a trace on the past, since the government was accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now go ahead, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer and for the UK," said the new CEO Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has six-point backet seats and harn belt, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and a realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try on different forms of rally in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigorous and realities of the raids rally.
We’ve been very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost dog after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable corniche in a career
Ruby, a cocker spaghetti, had escaped after a serious road accident
She was found three days later by a man who walked his dog stuck in the career.
Firefighters descend as a reminder along the rock to recover the dog and save her from a certain death.
A puppy was lucky to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to get him back safely while he was hunted 15 m above the ground on the unstable climb of a rock.
Ruby, a 9-month cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social networks after she disappeared in the career following a serious accident.
About 14:15 on Wednesday, a person with sharp sight that walked his dog noticed Ruby on a corniche in the career, stuck at 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton firefighters has rushed to the site and is descended as a reminder to save Ruby using an animal cave to carry it up to the top of the rock.
The technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said, “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the rock, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely didn’t move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But it is okay now.
She eaten cookies afterwards.
It was an unusual call.
It’s incredible that someone has noticed the dog.
Technical rescue expert Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get out of it.”
He could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfying, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: “I was scared watching the rescue.”
I didn’t think she was up there.
It was surprising to have it in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and that she had disappeared, she would probably fall.
The firefighters were excited.
What they did was really courageous.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We were afraid she would fall but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can’t believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he has never drawn Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio this week, the pop star said she was a chorist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He dragged me when I was 18 years old.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and it was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70 years old, said that he “catalogically denies having made advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she confuses it with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, “Prism”, came to the top of the charts this week.
Beijing to challenge Turkmen Islamic movement
“The backdrop support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia,” the chief of the Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke in Tachkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official designates a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the dominant Muslim region of Xinjiang, border with several countries in Central Asia, raped their car loaded with gas boards against the entrance to the forbidden city in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver, his wife and mother died in the fire.
The ethim, which declares struggling for the independence of the eastern Turkestan, former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the al-Qaeda affiliated organizations.
This movement is often designated by Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its actual influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The breakdown of Europe gives Scotland a choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Zone in order to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of checking the passports in Berwick and a border of barbered wings along the Hadrian Wall.
Although it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic consequences of a greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was nevertheless not included in the big titles (and it was to be predicted).
No one has said that the EU member states spend a large part of their time overturning their formal rules when they do so.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen space for the moment, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in exchange for everything it wants to get from Scotland.
This is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bubble that “independence means pass control” more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten one interesting point in this interpretation of an old dustful tale.
Why should an independent Scotland actually follow the instructions of Europe?
Why do we exchange the yogue of London with the yogue of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unite Europe is definitely at the dead point.
With the euro crisis, the Project Europe has officially died.
Thro Europe, the parties that oppose the EU or are fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and arrived nonewhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis has made a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan weighing on the national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments recording excessive budget deficits – that was true only for Greece.
Instead, the European system has made its members weigh the exchange rates that are favorable to German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, Southern European countries face an intrinsic problem of productivity towards Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and monetary problems, there is a deeper discomfort related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than the US.
This is a redhibitory disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen it in Grangemouth.
All wage gels in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being punished by a cheap U.S. steel gas.
As a result, the revolt burns, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a foot of equality with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to demean.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s extreme right party, the anti-European National Front, just won a crucial partial election, returning the socialists to power to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – an appropriate warning for the British Labour Party that reminds it that it cannot start from the principle that a division of the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to take advantage of the next year’s European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties make a good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the unified anti-European and anti-monetary feeling in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the “Europe of the (sovernmental) nations” freely privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the UK to take its distances from this project, and I hope it will make the eyes gentle to the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific leaves the idea that Britain will be left for account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small region of England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending a walk to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement provided that we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Nations Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it is to be noted – the best-successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Schiffer, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: getting older
Studies show that African-American and Spanish young girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that obesity epidemic could be a trigger of premature puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so expressed in boys.
CNN’s former correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's pubian breasts and hair begin to grow at 7 or 8 years old?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – in general, this doesn’t indicate a fast evolution towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Evident signs of development, such as brushing the breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubian area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first menstruation over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 years three quarters in 1970.
“When the chest has begun to grow, it takes at least two or three years before the first menstruation appears,” said Kaplowitz, also author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most precise test to see how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered “precoce” when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrist can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can block growth and a small size in adulthood.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the child’s age, growth rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that “controling puberty can alleviate certain behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have their menstruations.
“They’re afraid of the risk of pregnancy or even how they’re going to deal with hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” reminds a woman whose daughter had her first menstruation at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we had talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from school, scared and scared of being the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to public knowledge about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 who linked the percentage of fat mass to the trigger of puberty.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Spanish young girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than young white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of premature puberty seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the pubian area younger, the tendency to a real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubian hair is common, even in infants and infants.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask for advice from their pediatrist to know how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early should be assured of the fact that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Hommage to the People of Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that just began to sound there, before Bob Dylan's arrival.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography was just the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinemathèque, had raffled the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unless they were able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their devolve on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs played live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich attours in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less glowing clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the jury debited to the pistol when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who fails to perceive and is angry with the whole earth.
He accepts backward replacement on the foot lifted in the studios.
Without home, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
“His relationship with success is tortured, that’s what interests us: a mix of misfortune, a guy who’s not there at the right time, who’s not careerist but integrates, with a self-destructive behavior,” said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, Van Ronk's friend.
The film then takes the way of documentary, from the emblem of dust-invasive music of 33T invented inhabited by an unpaid old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafes where singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by incorporating a funny character that continuously passes through the film: a magnificent red cat with a cracking look, Llewyn Davis' wealth companion.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had reminded that he "granded in Tennessee, swimming by blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to "be considered good", "the coincidence can also launch someone's career," and "more and more today."
As Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let ourselves be surrounded by everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He will never know the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gerard de Villiers, who died Thursday at the age of 83, just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much of it."
He just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of the 198 and 199 opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically decreased by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was moving during this journey with a passenger.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gerard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, assured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Surely between 120 and 150 million all countries are confused," he said last March.
His birman cat on his knees, in the salon of his immense apartment in a building of the Foch Avenue, two steps from the Arc of Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which SAS' adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, indicating a pile of books on the lower table between the bruns or the elephants from the 130 countries arpented to place his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with favourable chest, wearing a gun or a gun of attack.
Inside, his quiet altitude (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a disguised Austrian aristocrat and CIA contractual agent to pay the repairs of the family castle, leaves himself to the shells of all the evil of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
“I’ve never claimed to be a literary author,” explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a container who writes to distract people to whom I don’t send a message.
He worked “as the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went to the place and returned with real and long investigations.”
SAS’ father said “to make a kind of geopolitical sheet.”
“I’m constantly in my dossiers (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave,” Gérard de Villiers added.
On the site I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: so, a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In The Fools of Benghazi, he had been the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command center in this city, the birthplace of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he scored the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in Panic in Bamako, he the 4X4 columns of jihadists based on the Mali capital.
I’m not guessing, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I just make assumptions from a country I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips in often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM marguerite writing machine "whose pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
At the walls of his office are hanged AK-47 rifles, erotic photos and photographs of the author with African war gentlemen.
Regularly appelled for machism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers discarded these accusations in two phrases.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gerard de Villiers said, “Malko Linge, like all the heroes, has no age.”
He will not die and will not retire.
Not more than me.
Airline operators struggle about the width of seats while large orders are on the game
The dispute raises between the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats of the tourist class on long-range flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation during the Dubai Air Show that takes place this month.
The conflict is about the width of seats offered on long-range flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most courtified by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the airline to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45,72 cm) in economic classes, but its great U.S. rival Boeing says it should be the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as airlines are trying to sell even larger versions of their long-range bimotor aircraft, hoping eventually a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be arranged at the back of the aircraft – in particular whether there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its rebuilt 777X will be able to accommodate in economic class 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus reports that the competitive version of its A350 will carry in economic class 350 people in 18 inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aviation giants often exchange hits on technical issues by making advertising in professional press.
Today, Airbus calls it directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X should take the step over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financeers of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant, entitled “Do you accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-course flights in closer seats than in regional turbopropulse aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ commercial director.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern long-courier journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average size of the 21st-century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is attached to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly called “jet set” was closer.
Airbus added that it ordered a study that indicates that an additional inch on the seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures regarding seat width and claims that it is not the manufacturer to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that cabin experience does not only depend on the width of seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their operations,” said Kent Craver, responsible for passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don’t want them to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is more and more a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a racing on aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at the market price in the coming decades, enough to shake the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first indicated in July, the seat configuration is exactly what feeds the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a seat-per-seat performance in their latest long-range motor models 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in row of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the configured device with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing does so to get more seats and make its aircraft more competitive by reporting to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus airline.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers advocate for a more dense configuration, which can go along with cheaper rates.
“A 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and chief editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines have to choose.
Aircraft sellers traveling around the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While venturing to offer comfortable devices, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern devices, experts say it is unlikely that his call to the aircraft industry in order to set up a standard of size for seats ends, but that it could make the 777X wave of sales forget.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of its group.
The vote is not compulsory but comes to tighten the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just out of the victory of his boat at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had passed a negative vote on his salary.
Oracle’s boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 financial year closed in May due to the group’s poor performance, which failed its growth goals, but he received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire decalated financial year 2013, Oracle's net profit rose by 3.5% while the stock exchange rate rose by 27.5%, surpassing the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure you take from smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction.
Other tests are needed before testing on humans begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an innocent virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having its nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice to whom then nicotine was given continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated “was calmed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so often that the levels of antibodies remained high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it turns the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but that much more detailed research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
Pakistani Taliban movement leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone attack on Friday in Pakistan, security services.
The death of Akimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But officials of the intelligence, the army and the activist movement said this time he had lost his life in this attack, carried out in the region of northern Kazakhstan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," a senior security official said.
On Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, told the British government that talks had been undertaken with Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi is not influenced by Obeid
New South Wales' former labour minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former Southern New Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied to have changed the policy of commercial loans at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation to see if Mr. Obeid had made pressure on several state ministers to renew his locations in Circular Quay, where the Obeid owns two restaurants and a cafe, after their expiry in August 2005, without any tender.
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid’s secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi’s former Deputy Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the government made pressure to make the lease a tender.
The locators were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the lease relating to Circular Quay companies, which brought about $2.5 million a year to Obeid, was renewed without any tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Port Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially favorable to the tender.
But he denied to have changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, demanded a change in the government’s policy in the field of loans.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls passed in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the trade loans policy,” deputy commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don’t remember what we talked about but in any case it wasn’t that.
Not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli aircraft target Syria, officials say
Israeli aircraft reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The manager did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted air strikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass a "authenticity test"
The government is currently investigating the possibility of putting in place a “authenticity” test for foreign workers with a visa 457 while it is planning to extend the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent the 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a distorted way to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government work document was revealed today when Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The failing statements on the ‘outsiders returning to the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to the time when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the White should be protected – and I’t be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The work document reports the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet high officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see “if the job offer is authentic in the event that the applicant is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsors him.”
Companies may also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lanka asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The 9 year old son of the man was traveling to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Baron Transport Minister Kramer said the project "will gather the UK."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excitated” with the idea of working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will lead to a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is finished, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed connection between London and northern England, ranging from £32.7 million to £42.6 million.
The British government, which is in negotiations with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the duration of flights to northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel durations between Glasgow and Edinburgh of a maximum of three hours.
Baron Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer.”
We push the HS2 project because the advantages it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a problem of the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “unquivocally” support Scotland’s inclusion into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the global high-speed rail network project throughout the UK.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine the options aimed at bringing the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I’m looking forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we’ll decide together on the next steps.”
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during landing and landing despite the U.S. gesture to relieve the regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read ebooks, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in “fly” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to have access to their e-books during landing and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that forces U.S. carriers to do a significant job in order to comply with the requirements, but they said they do not intend to immediately change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” she said.
The issue is subject to a regulation that obliges aircraft operators to ensure the continuous maintenance of safety and passengers to comply with the safety guidelines given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to the CASA of its intention to extend the use of its on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it respected the current rules for the moment.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during landing and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will carefully examine the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, handbag transport programmes and guidelines provided to passengers.
“As soon as a airline has verified its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, ebook readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be secure under seats or in the upper compartments during landing and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fighting
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmeric vehicles, two ambulance and a group of about thirty people according to the witnesses gathered...
In this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rix involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
Four slightly injured people should be regretted.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the place to separate the fighters and ensure that the wounded are taken care.
Singapore's wagering lenders take advantage of the middle class forced to stretch the belt
In a bond lender at the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold ears to pay his daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” said Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, has become this week the third-largest loan company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Getting jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Mrs. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s almost as cheap as ungaranted bank loans.
In general, Singapore's guaranteed lenders take an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, wagering lenders have the advantage of not asking for solvency verification or salary proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
Consequently, millions of people across the region turn to loans on guarantees as families feel the pressure that is exercised by the increased cost of life and the overduty of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the cheap credit powered by a too laxist monetary policy in advanced economies, low-income and middle-income families are turning to loans to fill the difference while their economies are experiencing a slowdown.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the growing household debt, mainly resulting from the rise of mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest domestic debt/GDP ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is in the top with 80 percent of GDP, while this rate was 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just gone out this week from a technical recession.
Thursday, data showed a continuous weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance is that with the rise of costs, people in the middle or below [the salary scale] seek to complement their income as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have made people rush to put their personal effects in place to touch the cash value of their jewellery.
In Singapore, approximately 70% of the items placed in the city-state 200 loans shops are in gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let’s put the grandmother’s golden chain in war and we’ll come back to pick it next month.”
In Thailand, the largest loans store operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores over the past few months.
The rise is such in the loan sector that ValueMax, operating the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this in Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its chief executive.
The company will fund them using 60 percent of Singapore’s $66 million that it raised this week when it was introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have exhausted criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Mr. Yeah points out that wagering offers not only lower interest rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
“Clients mortgage the property they already possess, and the fact of monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt,” she says.
Betting is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to the loans on the guarantee are not just those who have financial problems.
People from Singapore also go to the ValueMax loan stores to put in bet gold lingots or Rolex clocks, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of the company.
“It may be easy people who need to borrow short-term for business or investment, or small who have cash needs to pass a difficult way,” Mr. Yeah adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of youth pornography in New Scotland
A pastor who was taking care of young people in the Halifax region in New Scotland is accused of youth pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30 years old, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was offending, said to be deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
It should not communicate with people under 18 years of age and not access the Internet.
He will appear at the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket before being thrown away.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred with a brassard with the gamied cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers were complaining to the headquarters of the establishment who called the police, said the store on Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” said a spokesman for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police for the rescue, but "the time it arrived, it was already gone without climbing," she added.
I made the tail when I saw a woman that seemed annoying.
The people were mouthful.
“You don’t go out on the street if you don’t want to attract the attention,” a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween day, where it is usual to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda," Paul Dutton said, explaining he suffered from "mental problems."
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania’s health system
The federal government claims that the $325 million rescue plan for the vacillating health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "urgency measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the system restrictions.
The financing, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania's independent deputy Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our opinion, will solve the unique difficulties the state is facing,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
Further 2,600 operations, including in the field of ortopedic surgery and cataracts, will help with retardation.
Funding is also provided for the clinics without appointment in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, medical executives training, mental health services and the implementation of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to top-line clinics, this is the best way to treat Tasmania’s health system,” said Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmania government would face a strict regime of reporting and accountability.
The state will have to maintain the current levels of financing in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person committee will be formed to ensure that the State provides the services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent aid request he submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “rich solution.”
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s labor government has removed $430 million from its health system,” he told ABC TV.
We can’t have a state government that draws almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that put 300 million dollars, and claim it’s a fixed day.
Mr. Dutton visited Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel has a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstruction of the time, but it is also more hard than it should be.
During the 1760s in France, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unlimited cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never goes into lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penitence for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, the surveillance body says
Syria has destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international agency for chemical weapons surveillance said Thursday, while violent confrontations were rage in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived with a day in advance on the deadline for the
The Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or “do useless” all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious calendar aimed at destroying Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Due to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mouth gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement was made when the struggles were rageous on Thursday in the city of Safira which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain.
The group of activists, which follows the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government estimates that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government forces fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah activists.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
About 2 million people had to flee the country due to the conflict.
Assad’s troops are struggling against the rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda networks in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any accuracy.
The struggles have highlighted the importance of the dangers that chemical weapons inspectors face as they have to complete their mission, which is to free Syria from its toxic arsenal in the midst of a lasting civil war, within a tight time.
A statement from the OIAC, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “now pleased to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machines for mixing and filling.”
She added that “no other inspection activities were planned for the moment.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites by Damascus.
They were not able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OIAC said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other said sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the OIAC inspectors couldn’t visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OIAC Executive Committee.
“I greet the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the framework of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the organization’s chief executive Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the Civil War mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the alauite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Wrath caused by the punishment against one of the bombers of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger to the punishment sentenced against the last of the conspirators to be brought to court, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution pilot.
Patek, who spent 10 years fleeing as one of the most sought after men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of the explosives used during the attacks.
He may be released after 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks targeting two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the deaths of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also convicted of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia in the early Christmas day in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a perpetual imprisonment, but they could have demanded that the man, called “Demolition Man” for his reputation as an expert in bomb manufacturing, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction of Patek and the other conspirators 10 years ago.
On the edge of tears, she said Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be trapped in front of the execution plate,” Ms. Corteen told AP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, nor seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when an enormous bomb, charged in an outer garage, exploded just after 23 a.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze shot a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into the coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was “dead” three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek had to have the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep it alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive.
Spending 20 years in jail after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bombers to be brought to court.
He had managed to avoid being captured for 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former Al-Qaeda leader, Oussama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Ben Laden in order to restore links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t go,” added Mrs. Corteen.
Until recently, he laughed out of the sadness he could have caused to other people.
The verdict was issued on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Mr. Corteen said.
Patek may, however, appeal against his condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but do not call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not speak on their mobile phone – under the new highly anticipated guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the crew members’ training manuals and the storage rules to be in compliance.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“According to the plan, we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft is landing before landing and do not light them up until the aircraft is set up.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their devices during landing, landing and landing on the ground, the FAA said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use the Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, chairman of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
“When the new policy is safely implemented – and we will work closely with the carriers for it – it will be profitable for everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are honestly tired of feeling like “room surveillants” when it comes to this question.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to browse, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in air mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown out of a American Airlines plane after he refused to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices such as laptops will always have to be arranged because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also be banned.
The regulatory power concerning mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during landing and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered to be a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could interfere with mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
A Industrial Advisory Committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government authorizes the wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased over the past few years to alleviate the restrictions on its use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported FM radios, the high-tech gadget of then.
New line aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
The airlines have allowed their passengers to use the Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to host Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of line aircraft should allow a broader use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit radio broadcasts of much lower power than the previous generations of devices.
E-books readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who press for a relief of the restrictions regarding the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s leaders charged a Kindle e-book reader line plane and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there was no one.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee of mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft may interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorizes pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landings on the instruments under conditions of poor visibility.
A group of travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them good-minded arrangements for travelers equipped with technology.
“We are happy that the FAA acknowledges that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into nature
A bird, healed after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
The water rail was raised on board a helicopter towards Aberdeen last month before it was delivered on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Head of the center, Colin Seddon, said: “This waterfall was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to bring our help.”
The water was healthy when it was released.
Is the EU ready to deal with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing together and defining what wealth creators and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the broadest and most comprehensive survey from British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, companies and the EU.
YouGov has surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, generally representative of all sizes of, sectors and regions in the UK.
The conclusions of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to engage in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their opinion on specific political points—from regulation of monopolies to product laws—the majority of business managers think that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster’s hands.
The single market has caused a general dissatisfaction, saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate with the benefits that there are to be part of the European exchange zone – 40% of the large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agreeing.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey with business leaders revealed that a significant majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives in favour of a treaty change and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not policy.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a “significant change” that returns power to the UK.
The challenges are high – achieving a treaty change and better representing the interests of Britain would allow a 16% shift in the votes for the country’s stay in the EU at a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt a moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan aimed at renegotiating the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renewal of negotiations will represent a significant change in the current balance of power in favor of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and more and more necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed on the way of a closer economic and tax union.
Priority should be employment and growth in the UK and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for it means to put the focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in Halloween Colors
In the United States, President Obama did not deviate from Halloween tradition.
With his wife, yesterday night, he distributed sweets to hundreds of children invited in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the festivals have taken over.
In New York, thousands of dressed people took part in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excitated, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I finally got the costume I had planned last year.
We’re fun like crazy, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
It’s a good child, it’s cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated in the eve of the Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the gas pipeline of Bulgaria opens a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“A historic event took place today: the construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale project in Europe,” said Alexei Miller, the CEO of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream should allow to diversify export routes from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart from Ukraine, a country through which the majority of Russian gas is transmitted to Europe, increases the risk level compared to conventional roads, the director added.
Miller added that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated “for ever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project will be launched in 2015.
Gazprom said the construction is expected to start in other low-level countries by the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn plans to build the world’s largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world’s largest marine reserve, Tahiti newspaper Les Nouvelles announced on Thursday, receiving information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambia archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutines of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English Navy that took place in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly the descendants of the Bounty mutines, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends at 95% of London’s generosity.
The Island Council voted unanimously for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which is 836,000 km2 that corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A adjunct to the island's mayor went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that creating such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for its island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would enable the United Kingdom to sanctuate these 836,000 km2, provided that however they have the means to ensure their surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the ZEE of French Polynesia, neighboring Pitcairn.
The FAA relieves the restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft – but it will always be prohibited to make calls on mobile phones.
Fighting aircraft attack a stock of Russian missiles in the port city of Latakia, a official said.

Former Chinese Deputy Governor sentenced to life
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin in northeastern China was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million yuan of pot-de-vin, Chinese official media reports.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the chairman of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped and managers to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office in March last year, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon constitutes a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tiger" as with the "mushes" - the subalterne officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, among whom former executives of the Petrochina oil giant.
The most spectacular recent case was that of former Chongqing PCC leader Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after he targeted the highest functions within the state.
But the government has in no way expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord, during a royal commission hearing.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were accused of sexual assault against children after allegations against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord, in 2011, during an audience of the Royal Commission charged with sexual abuse on children.
But in its opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA said that it “has never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director-General Phillip Hare was interrogated on two cases: a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography crimes and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education monitor was accused of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a counselor at the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was inaccurate, stressing, “external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that children’s safety was an absolute priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four institutions during a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord’s recruitment and that he had failed to check that employees knew they were required to report any violation of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevents staff from reporting Lord’s failures toward children’s safety.
Staff members witnessed that they had noticed some faults, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that he put them on his knees, that he told them he loved them, and that he allowed them to play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was worried about her behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah’s childhood service manager Jacqui Barnat, who included Lord “very intimidating and difficult to approach most times.”
The Director-General said he rejected the staff’s testimonies that they were rejecting the idea of reporting these failures to their hierarchical superior.
Instead, he said that the friendship they had with Lord broke their judgment, making them not reporting his actions.
Mr Hare said he had expressed his point of view before the YMCA Council of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson taken from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not concern the “report” by the staff, and the council was agreeing with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to sign the privacy agreements to the staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA’s Director-General for Children’s Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was a “excess of jealousy” and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe child organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual violence, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He said there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was delayed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his opinion about various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007, after a decade in the country's headquarters, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and to his role as the Quadrant's Special Envoy for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Mr. Blair would have answered, according to the London Event Standard: “Yes, of course, but it may be likely that this happens, so...”
When many experts in square demonstrations gathered in Cardiff to confront and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew that the competition would be hard.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old boy.
Not yet at school and just a few months after making his first weapons, the little boy and his poney Shetland Toffee scored during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank square center, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hat, he was wearing his flat hat a little on the side in a relaxed way to make his 2-year-old Poney Toffee roll around the track.
Fenton was greeted by judges for his natural training qualities unusual to a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his third birthday in March last year and has since trained with his Shetland Pony every day.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.”
They presented themselves against and against all, but both racked the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy of the joy that he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Valley, in the south of Wales, follows the traces of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has participated in square competitions for more than 10 years.
Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it.”
He travelled the entire length of the track running and even though it seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is mad of animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way it started, he will surely soon participate in the Horse of the Year – and I’m sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual square demonstration said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his poney.”
They are a good team.
Judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they parade on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the poney and the coach – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure that his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of appearance.
A Chinese newspaper launched a call “will be changed”
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of diffamation will be replaced, a press regulator said.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted pot-de-vin to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will be undergoing a “complete rebuilding,” the regulator said.
The order of “revision” comes from the Guangdon administration for the Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the Zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express writing was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete renovation of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation of the responsible people at New Express and immediately remove the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a building machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a call on first page for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running for money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apologies, New Express published his apologies on the first page, writing that he had not correctly checked his articles.
Several suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in line.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of the two nuclear heating stations in Charles de Gaulle, in the middle of October and while the ship was in the sea, was "without danger for the sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has just confirmed the "unavailability" of the ship until "middle November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the company DCNS, a specialist in the naval defense, assures that its teams and those of Areva, sent to the Var for the occasion, “currently intervene on the aircraft carrier.”
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing heater.
“Everything is implemented so that Charles de Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” DCNS explains.
And the National Navy to certify that "this does not question the program of activity of the ship" nuclear propulsion.
Remember that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle is out of a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had travelled from Toulon in mid-October for a training.
This, in particular, is aimed at qualifying young hunting pilots.
A "small failure", circonscribed to the reactor's confinement space, had then occurred on the French fleet's admiral ship.
According to the National Navy, the crew was not exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I’m able to see a strong dissatisfaction from the part of the people I meet: monstrous re-evaluation of their properties, tax flood, cost of all kinds of permits, administrative expenses to no longer end.
In short, unlimited siphonage of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken by force from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their poverty.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, we don’t worry about the overwhelming expenses and the maintenance of boxes: deficit cultural center, strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they must be sold to the private company or destroyed.
It is also shameful to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
I, however, give an honorable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not the public spaces to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on the demand of the consumer.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Lakes on Fish and Piles will continue to supply the city with clean water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (big water consumers) and the large decline of the population, water use has significantly decreased everywhere on the territory.
Without saying to waste it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulations regarding its use could be greatly mild.
In short, it is very easy to do great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is not even able to buy a pen without passing through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by cravates with great degrees mostly and I don’t think a sheep farmer makes it worse.
A drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico has its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels serving for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The US authorities have described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they’ve ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzaging on an equivalent length to six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, the United States.
The area is full of indeterminable warehouses, which allows you to easily hide truck loads loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out and passed unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities captured 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intention of selling.
They are sentenced to a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in the center of Mexico in October, making it a challenge for drug cartels who have to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a pass of about 700 yards equipped with railways that departed from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issued extradition order against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition order against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who refused to the Ecuador Embassy in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard said she had issued a "reference warning" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear to a police office, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after he exhausted all possible roads under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he intercepted against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm will allow his transfer to the United States, he found shelter at the Ecuador Embassy in London on June 19, asking this South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has issued a resignation warning against a 40-year-old man who asks him to appear to a police office on the date and time of his choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under guarantee.
The Embassy refused to comment on the opinion by the police.
Assange is afraid to be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he may be accused of spying, after having revealed more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting against secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Finished the passwords to enter to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict us a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy General Director of Morpho, even believes that “the century will be biometric.”
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a transverse and transnational universe as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are worried about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission of Computer Science and Freedoms has authorized 774 systems of fingerprint recognition, hand shape or hand venous network in, administrations, cantines...
“Everyone will soon be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, a consumer privacy manager at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will allow to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are the fingerprints, the hand contour and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
“For example, some people working with concrete have very damaged fingers and their footprints are unreadable,” says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity domain at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand imply a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - you can't capture these data without knowing them - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes needs to be repeated and thus takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for about twenty years on other approaches, such as the recognition of the face or iris (the colorful part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased precision of the sensors and the computing capacity of the computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border stations using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” says Sridhar Iyengar, head of security research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible markers, the DNA also raises hope and concerns.
“In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,” confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a suitcase costing €90,000 to analyze DNA samples on the place of a crime and within an hour.
The uses of biometry are divided into two groups: identification (recognition of one person among others) and authentication (assure that the person is the one it claims to be).
The identification so far concerned the issuance of identity papers: it is necessary to confront the biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) with the information that the state possesses about all citizens already registered.
This allows you to make sure that a person does not try to usurp the identity of someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
“We recover the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them with the photos of celebrity freely circulating on the Internet,” says Dany Nassif, responsible for commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use: photograph a quidam that makes the tail in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication originally concerned physical access (border, protected locations, cantins...) or logical access (computer opening).
It has recently been added to the presence control.
"A biometric pioneer avoids the phenomenon of the friend who points for another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by entering his card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the touch of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and distributors: at the time of paying in the store with his bank card, the customer does not tape his code, but puts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon come to French merchants.
Tips to Reliance Users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive in the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
“If, thanks to biometry, a customer remains in the box for thirty seconds less, it’s valuable,” the director of a large surface explains.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
“The fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are on a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it,” says Philippe Robin, from Thales.
But, in the absence of thorough studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Specialists in privacy protection, they continue to worry.
“The progress in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me worse: a generalized surveillance,” says Andrew Patrick, of the Privacy Protection Commissioner in Canada.
A driver riding 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was charged with a £1,000 amendment.
A driver was charged with a fine of £1,000 for riding 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at the height of Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink to take between his legs.
In the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the caution and attention required.
The seven points withdrawn on his license led to a six-month license withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay fees of £90 and a £100 surcharge for the victim.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to burn the bull in London
The Treasury has temporarily encrypted the capital gain tax measure but awaits a final decision by Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, has enrolled a 7% stamp fee for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own properties within a company rather than individually.
The stamp tax is already applicable to residential properties in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million in the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, Northwest and the Yorkshire and Humber region gathered.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in the stamping tax on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-evitation law in this matter, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are subimposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.”
"But this change could make foreign investors rejective to the idea of buying properties in London or current owners rejective to the idea of selling," he added.
The prestigious real estate – 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located southwest of London that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage of 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in the center of London show a regular growth from year to year of 5.6%, but have been eclipsed by a “internal market” in full growth, the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6,5%) experiencing a recovery, according to the studies of Savills.
Scientists have just revealed how a dog's neck movements are related to his mood.
Previous studies have revealed that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs move it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in the stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what was there in other species.
He added that like in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs' disordered tail movements, the researchers followed animals watching movies where other dogs were shown.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will not take a long time before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented to dogs films in which other dogs were presented – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able to trade the cheek movement and present it as going more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression moving the tail to the right (from the dog's point of view moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a tail deviating mainly to the left (one again from the point of view of the dog that moves the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn’t think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
He rather thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you meet several times with other dogs and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience.”
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the dog species.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln discovered that the dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “The dogs were easier to go to a robot dog when his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is shown in the Italian study.”
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the different studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or the robots dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Al many evidence, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it will not take a long time before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys delays concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after the singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to take place on Friday in the concert hall The Hydro in the city centre.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.”
“Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform at the concert.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any discomfort caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest church men placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – that is, therefore, a group of 120 “elect cardinals.”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as Consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoque the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of the other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals elected will probably decrease.
He said that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as it needed for the number of cardinals elected to reach 120 and as many cardinals older than 80 as he wanted.
The consistory of the next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
Currently, there is a kind of tendency to prefer Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he added.
40 percent of the Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with examining the means of reforming the church.
The pope decided by himself.
“From now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero explained.
He added that it was “completely possible” that Francis would ask for advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never experienced such a situation – it’s completely new.
Valero pointed out that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the cardinal rank, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM reminds some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair seats
General Motors Co reminds 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually inclinable files, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. agency responsible for vehicle safety regulation.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the records do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards for headloads.
“If the vehicle is hit by the back, it is possible that the headset does not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury,” according to a statement posted on the site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recorded models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
GM’s pickup launch began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickups owners of the defect during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA failed to review the information letter to owners due to the 16-day stop of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Sales of pickups Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price rose by 1.4% to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker died buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m., on the Marquette Street, near the intersection of the Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
Probably, the work on the foundations had been on this place for some time.
A Mitoyan foundation wall was just built in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim just arrived on the building to recover the tools.
I passed by the car and I saw the wall collapse with a large cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains near the building.
I landed and I went to remove the big roofs that covered him.
I saw only one part of his back, it was so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is a 50-year-old man who worked for a coffering company.
Reanimation maneuveres were tried by emergency services, but failed.
He did not survive his serious injuries.
A inspector from the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was sent to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding the drama.
The shout of an Obama voter
I have voted for President Obama twice, believing in the possibility of a change.
He says Obama has made praiseful efforts disappointed by the Republican Party’s obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drones attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at the Harvard School of Medicine.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
This is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the 2nd year of medicine and would give me hope back.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memories of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical reports of my patients at night and I slept, this book takes me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and when speeches could breathe you.
The election ended with a tremendous victory and the presenters of the newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My colleagues cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was moving forward to the White House and the nation was ready for the change.
During Obama's transitional period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% of favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Return to the present is a difficult awakening, it’s like getting out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these days full of optimism, they’re like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I imagined.
I put Obama’s credit to great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (the law on affordable care) to the departure of our army from Iraq, through the end of “no seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstruction has destroyed too many efforts aimed at promoting our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after many times defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the edge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency gathers data about the privacy of Americans, nor the accusation of the denunciers that reveal the government’s faults.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the excess of the expenditure allowed during the presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House’s efforts to reduce the media to silence are “the most aggressive... since Nixon’s administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot apologize for the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don’t know if that’s what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is unpredictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That’s what annoys me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that seemed unable to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being released from the pressures of future elections, would keep the promises that were heard so long ago.
However, while the positive opinion index dropped below 45% this week, it’s even more difficult to return to the year 2008 through this book.
It makes me desire the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses for Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primary.
During a post-campagne meeting, he told his team that they should go back on the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
“I want us to learn about our talent,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 15 a.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The motorist, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fléron, did not wear helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died in this front collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire deputy Clive Palmer advances that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnat, which disputes the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, has made this argument to try to remove the questions concerning a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said Mr. Abbott’s daughters were ready to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially announced that Mr. Palmer won the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a reform of the voting system to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact details in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pen to mark the voting bulletins.
Is it to be able to delete the result if someone is not in agreement?
Nowadays, having a paper pen seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possible options with regard to electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We don’t seek a reward, except the history reward because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new species of bosse dolphin along the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for the scientific mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM), returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Do you be surprised by the discovery of this new wild dolphin species?
This is a good news, but it doesn’t surprise me.
While in the past species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
It is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology question the classification or membership of a species to a species, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified the animals, based on the morphological differences between the species.
Today, some of these rankings are challenged due to the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very morphologically close species have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific Bose Dolphins and the Atlantic Bose Whales.
Recent studies have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by the researchers, they didn’t know that it was part of a new species, present only in that place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we might be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a wider species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or under extinction depending on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for the Sousa chinensis species, of which the population of the new species discovered is out, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This breeding of genes limits the creation of new species.
On the contrary, closer ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species in the future.
The sea environment is the least known environment.
It’s better to send robots to Mars than to know what’s living in the Marian cave, just 11 kilometers from the sea.
We spend more money in searching for life on other planets than in searching for marine and it’s time that it changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its exchange market division according to two sources close to the case, which once more shows that the global investigation of regulators on suspicion of exchange market manipulations begins to bring its fruits.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the framework of the investigations conducted on the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 billion changes hand every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the extension of the investigation that is an echo of the scandal of interbank interest rate manipulations Libor.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it received information requests from the regulators.
“The ongoing investigation on this case is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” said a representative of the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said that RBS had transmitted files of instant emails and messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and had been suspended from his post as European trading manager for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European chief exchange trader at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by banks working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS explained this week that it had filed an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspicion of exchange market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining the allegations made concerning bankers who would have been heard to manipulate rates on the exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received information requests from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks are browsing instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of regrettable acts.
News about these surveys have shocked traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banks trading units over the past few years, but that has been questioned this year due to the low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having a low-cost impact on the market.”
The news arrived the same day when the Swiss Credit announced that it had returned a trader working at its London Stock Exchange trading office this week after causing a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been controlled,” a representative of the Credit Suisse said.
Investigation on Mayor Rob Ford has been shut down, advocate says
After the police confirmed to have put the hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby claimed he has never seen an investigation "so blurred".
Me Ruby said to believe the Canadian Press that the police had "ignorated or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents indicate.
Me Ruby called "inexplicable" the fact that the police had never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or placed on hearing his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair chose in knowledge of reason not to act against the mayor.
According to the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrest the mayor, and conduct a search – even without mandate.
It would also have been able to demand an immediate investigation mandate, if deemed necessary.
Police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Me Ruby’s statements “evident and desperate attempt” to be claimed to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the submission of a criminal accusation against the mayor.
European stock exchanges drop in mid-session except London
With the exception of London, the major European stock exchanges are going down on Friday to mid-session, flooded by some disappointing companies news, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could terminate its quantitative relief policy earlier than expected.
On the contrary, after the announcement of an inflation of 0.7% for the entire euro area, the idea spread among the market actors that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relieve its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures are predicting an open up of U.S. shares, after two consecutive sequences of withdrawal.
In the values, Renault (-4,63%) recorded the strongest decline from the CAC 40, flooded by the warning on the outcome of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also announced the results falling this morning and announced the creation of an internal defeat structure ("bad bank") aggregating 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains in the top of the EuroFirst300 rise in response to a press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the exchange market, the ECB’s monetary policy speculation goes well, as said John Hardy, Saxo Bank’s strategist.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week’s meeting.
We expect a strong potential for the euro’s fall.
In this context, the euro continues its withdrawal against the U.S. currency and hit a two-week lower to $1,3517.
These same conjections, on the contrary, support the euro area bond market.
The Supreme Court approves Obama’s health system reform law
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court declared today that the health system reform law ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe a health insurance by 2014, under the penalty of having to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the government’s tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the law of 2,700 pages and also considered that the provisions of the law on the reform of the health system, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold to Medicaid should be lowered under the penalty of losing all federal funding of the program, were compulsory in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure aimed at blocking the law was launched by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates to the presidential election in the 2012 primary, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, have sharply opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to former fighters in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet Cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as numerous patriot associations, gave this Friday afternoon a tribute to the soldiers and the deceased of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday night at a violent hang on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday 1 November after an exhaust of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian Enclosure Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank bus shot during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were found dead when a Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on a tunnel caught by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, a Israeli tank and a blinded bulldozer made an incursion of about a hundred meters within the territory before they then retreated.
The strike lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abou Zouhri honored the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the al-Qassam heroes who have fallen defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
“Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant,” the spokesman threatened.
The Israeli army said that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel excavated in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities."
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them with Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, a Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive machine targeting the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
“This mission was imperative due to the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians,” said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel has hit a military air base in northwest Syria, targeting a missile cargo intended for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya on Thursday 31 October.
A U.S. official confirmed a "Israeli blow" but did not give details about the target.
“In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he added.
Israeli officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citating "exclusive sources" that it has not named, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing was aimed at a cargo of ground-air missiles that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had several explosions heard on Wednesday morning at an air defense base in Sonar Jable, near Latakye, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, was unable to identify the origin of the explosions.
Return in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the encres and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
A evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink to white black.
A white screen serves as a wall.
On the carpet, so white, in the immense space that is the House New Theatre, advances, profile, fine like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, a ink of Henry Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a set of physical imitates of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playground, rush when the next graphic appears, they incarn it, they come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solos relays, in group to the unisson (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the front stage.
This is the same principle, PowerPoint giant version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a breakdown when Carol Prieur will shelter under the dancing carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or retention, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue to dance.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This sound and energetic, long discharge, if possible, ends up turning and turning.
It is also the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - such as those hair that burns or those black tissues that length the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has imposed himself, with his tics.
Result: the bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’ inserts, like Gestalt’s shapes, open up a wider and bigger imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hacked by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the contract, is richer.
The scene is partially drawn of grey, dancers and a piano are covered with fabric, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers relate to play the partitions.
Their mistakes in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On the scene, the couples pass, in love duo, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Butterflies appear, also familiar with Chouinard, treating the nose red, in very polarized male-female loving parades.
Love is carnage, escape or player.
The gestuals, laughter and small screams gently transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coit, of the beings that merge.
But the room takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the scene when the audience leaves.
There everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is Chouinard’s art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phones manufacturers, including Google, the company it haired the pot during the auction of the patents that took place after Nortel’s bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for breach of patents before the U.S. Assessment Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow to display advertising related to search terms on the Internet, the conclusions of the trial indicated, which is the core of Google’s business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that operate under Google’s Android operating system, which brings a fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million offer for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola’s patent library.
“While it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the trial concluded.
Rockstar claims greater damages and interests against Google, as it claims that Google’s patent breach is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater caused the explosion
The grandmother had burned a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, the king's prosecutor's replacement said on Friday evening.
The expert sent to the site by the prosecutor assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother burned a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The vital forecast of the two victims is always committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who stayed with his grandfather and his companion, was next to him and was slightly burned.
“The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the site before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she in helicopter, he in ambulance,” said mayor José Paulet, who descended on the site.
Traumatized, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Safe and safe, he was able to reach the floor through the staircase remaining intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were removed by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches have intervened.
Crisne’s civil protection stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to swear
Mohamed Morsi has given the oath of investition, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he gave the oath of investiture to the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his deposit before the Supreme Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first free-elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the collapse of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore before the 18 black-dressed judges of the court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
“We look forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have put the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer from the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and hardly repressed by the successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and, standing out of the Mubarak presidential past, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of its convoy in the very frequent streets linking the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “help wheel” of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has greatly strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to end the work started during the 2011 uprising against the authority president Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Morsi, in blue costume and red cravate, addressing the judges present in the decorated room of wooderies where he swore.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he spoke his investition speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national hymn while he was taking the guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by the song “The people and the army, hand in hand...” by thousands of people gathered in the university’s large amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic swear on Friday on the Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended the authority regime in Mubarak last year began, and swore to recover the presidential powers which the military council, which replaced the ex-president who was expelled, dismissed.
But by accepting to officially swear before the Court, rather than before the Parliament as it is usual, he tends to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the U.S. stopped the growth of the automotive market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighted on the growth of car sales in the U.S. in October, the figures published on Friday by manufacturers, five of the six main achieved lower performance than expected.
The three major Detroit manufacturers show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million sales in a yearly and corrected pace of seasonal variations but the market was set at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley analyst.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he estimates that this light breakout is first explained by “the government’s shutdown and its impact on consumer feelings in the first fifth of the month.”
However, GM an increase of 16% of its sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The group’s four brands saw their commercial performance improving compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales rise from 14% over a year to 191 985 vehicles, while consensus awaited 194 301.
Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced a 11% increase in sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143.536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show lower consensus sales, despite an annual increase of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM’s stock gained 1.4% at 16h35 GMT, while Ford gave up 1.1%.
Renault dropped on stock exchange by Nissan warning
Renault accuses Friday the strongest decline of the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had decreased its annual net profit forecast by 20 percent, traders report.
Nissan, which had to undertake such a revision, also announced a shift of its management.
Several traders that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a trading manager at a Paris broker.
In the framework of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near a neo-Nazi site
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by shootings shot by two people who were on board a motorcycle passing in front of a local Neonazi party Golden Dawn in the western suburb of Athens, a police source.
Police were not yet able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their potential political membership.
Some Greek media that members of the Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were the guards of their premises.
The wounded person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service went on to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident occurred and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurs a few weeks after the accusation of six Golden Dawn members, including the party’s leader and founder, for participation in a “criminal organization” as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's call rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, saw his call rejected and will be well suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against the Barça for addressing a blow to Neymar, the Scottish center saw his suspension extended to three matches by the UEFA.
In a statement, his club said he was "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are without electricity throughout the province, shortly afternoon on Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the Saint-Laurent River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15 042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13 464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also has a lot of faults with 7,000 private houses in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Center seems to turn down the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts to rise and hopes for record outcomes thanks to travelers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make a underlying profit over the entire financial year ranging between $325 and $340 million before taxes, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If the current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17 percent growth compared to the record $290.4 million profit in 2011/12.
Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had achieved 8% profits in the first half and that the second half had started in force, in terms of travel other than business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are on a good way to record results over the entire fiscal year before interest and tax deduction,” he said.
This applies to Australia and the UK, which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half, allowing to compensate for a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel industry recorded good results while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the U.S. recovered its losses during the first half where the seasonal demand is lower and had to draw a profit over the entire year for the third time in a row.
Flight Center shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people shoot at a hotel near the Pyramid of Cairo
Unknown people opened fire on Friday on a hotel near the Pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, as a result of a apparent dispute with dismissed employees.
The attackers took the flight, the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif said.
This attack occurs as Egypt almost no longer receives any tourists since the army has destroyed Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses in blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, ortography and grammatics
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the nineteenth century, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to today.
The examination will also present “new texts” to encourage more diverse reading.
A course that combines English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education has to publish tomorrow its new English and Math programmes – the first subjects to be undergoing a radical review.
It will make changes in other key matters next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examination Regulatory Bureau, will reveal a change in the structure of the GCSE, with a new rating system and less courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was a "bread consensus on the need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence", insisting that GCSE would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time in mathematics (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to dedicate more hours of time employment to mathematics, coalition government-related sources have indicated that the GCSE of deep mathematics – as well as the greater importance given to the subjects listed in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of course.
The program will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
A 10-year-old welcomes children with a gun at Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were working from door to door to ask for sweets on Halloween night.
One of the neighborhoods of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting gun.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the police that he had been afraid.
His weapon was captured.
The former Gestapo leader buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without a trace, was in fact buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
“His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte,” he told the newspaper on the basis of archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime by Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great mysteries of the After War.
The German intelligence services, the BND, that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were completely wrong.
"Since August 1945, the body of Müller was found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a command," according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing a general uniform.
“In the inner left pocket were his service states with a photo,” he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the municipality of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The chairman of the Central Jewish Council of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
Let one of the most brutal Nazis sadists be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous bad taste.
“The memories of the victims are hardly stumbled,” he insurged in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich that has never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided the “final solution” and had under his orders in particular Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the “logistics” of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle gives free health care in Cameroon villages
Dr Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this country of West Africa, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to choose him “CNN Hero of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to come to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma of which he was going to carry the sequences for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he got any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 p.m., go to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People may die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroons could not pay for the consultation.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty threshold, and three-quarters of the country’s health expenditure is made in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team practiced more than 700 free surgical acts over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they sit down in shells after fixing medical equipment on the roof and pass through difficult land to get to the villages that are most in need of help.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or mole trails.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great smile and overwhelming energy – is more than happy to join the holidays.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people each visit,” Mr. Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bequels, a pair of gloves collected or a free birth certificate – the necessary document to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, municipality or home; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the awakening room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the electric group lighting, the operation room and the material sterilization, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
This is an exciting pace, but the village musicians generally help the team to stay motivated.
“They hit the bubbles all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work,” Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroon doctors and medical students, practiced 700 free surgical acts over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they come to help.
A man explained that the free operation he had suffered to cure a hernia would allow him to work again.
“This will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works the night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which funds 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer within Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is always in the hospital or is trying to find money for his association so that he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for field learning that they don't have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help spong blood or send the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” Ms. O’Malley explained.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their retirement, transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
“It’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” Katie O’Malley said.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is not near to disappear.
For Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happy by keeping the promise he has made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that push me to do that.

The Two France by Pierre Nora
Perplexes, university students have long been hard to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheaters and classrooms?
Without a doubt, but highlighting its weakness for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitration of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Hereditary of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Certainly yet, but knowing that such a sacral cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it has passed.
They were delighted to recognize in him a great awakening, animator and federator of their works, but observing that he was unlikely to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Lieux de mémoire", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil languages could see a giant chip market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a vibrant look and stunned of erudition, but incurably dilettant.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who passed to not write had a lot and well written.
The book that is here should definitively make it justice.
There, however, is again the temptation of the ubiquity, the intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation put to jump like foot joined from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the different objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the broker back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive nod of French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: It is a time concern.
This is a little bit, we were collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the perpetual spirit of our then leaders, the French identity was an intemporary essence.
It was only necessary to displays the accidents, and the case, jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora traces is completely different.
He does not come to an inheritance of eternal freedom, he refuses to the definition.
An analyst worried about a familiar strange, he goes into a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
From which this, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so sustainably settled within its borders, so oldly shrimped and solidly masonated, are these dramatic calls to unity heard?
They are not so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjurate the trouble born of the disagreements of French history.
French and Gaulois, Armagnac and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the divisional forces here are very ancient.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that divides the national history into two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but not able to deny it; worried, on the contrary, of regaining its sacrality and of even more desire for unity and indivisibility that it had cut the head to the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of the French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagone, so that the American escape of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a Declaration of Rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousinage only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about it.
Here, men burned with an Old Indigenous Regime, and even more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when here it has sowed the drama and confit.
There are always honored founder fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors whose patterns are hard to make, and who have over the rest been killed.
There is an institutional constance, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as many errors to catch and attempts to take back.
France is coming, France is coming.
However, there was a time when the French believed they could pick up the broken dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: he greeted those who then employed themselves to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and proposing them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only a time.
It is now again in debate, bound by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the circonspective sketch of France that comes.
With, in prime, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve a few surprises.
It was discovered that the car was a carrier.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The router was in the center of the center.
And whoever had deposited, here is more than a half-century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but had abstained to the initiative exercise of the thesis, confesses us, cum grano salis, that he will end up doing it.
Surely in a less rigid, brighter and more subtle form.
But let’s not be wrong, just as compulsory.
For much more than the imposed figure of the academic course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
An ex-hostage in Lebanon: “The return is quite complex to manage”
Kidnapped in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team coming to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Returned since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Hostage of the World", which he chairs for several years.
Its main objective is to get the possibility for the hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
More than 1,000 days in prison, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Military Hospital of Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have been able, since, to find their families.
And to try, gradually, to regain the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, chairman of the association "Hostages of the World".
From the evening of your release, you were on the plateau of the 20h of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your liberation?
Especially in Beyrouth.
When I’m released, I find myself in the box of a car where I meet – without seeing him because he’s black – Roger Auque.
He tells me, “We are released,” but I’m not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tight too.
This is the war, and those who lead us are also very tired.
They put us on the edge of a trottoir.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then get to the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
The French lead us to the Embassy of France.
This is the time of the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I was bathing for an hour.
We had a t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to escape to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did you get to the French land?
I landed in Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is here.
It is a bit brutal.
There is an incredible bullshit.
and a lot of media.
When I went there were three TV channels.
I’m back and there’s a lot of them.
The descent of the plane stairs, the meetings with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many bicycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
Motorcyclists take the shell to take pictures and follow me up to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some from climbing.
The pressures of the media are huge.
It doesn’t stop, we are well placed to know it.
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and suddenly we get under the media fire.
It’s a bit complicated, a bit violent, quite complex to manage.
We did the hardest.
I’m at 20 a.m. and the next day I’m on TV.
Then start a kind of readaptation to life, very slowly, for one or two months that are a little like holidays.
How did the DGSE medical examinations and debriefing take place?
I had the right to a first medical examination in Corse.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grace the following days my return: radio, exam in all genres and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can rely on it, remind it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
This is part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence agencies.
They asked me questions about the kidnappers.
It was logical.
It didn’t bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four prisoners of Niger?
I listen to what is said.
Especially the ransom.
Some things irritate me, others less.
I try to share things between questions about my past as a hostage and my presidential hat of the "Hostage of the World" association that allows me to put a distance, and it seems much more interesting to address.
For example, the definition of resilience.
Especially, I struggle, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify the kidnapping as “political” kidnapping – which is the case most often – and to enable the kidnappers to have access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their kidnappers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoicing the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice?
There is a court in Hague for that.
Why would it not be said to the kidnappers, “You have violated the rules of war, like those of all Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice?”
I think it is legitimate, legitimate, well-reasoned.
This message was heard, but not heard, and it shocked me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the streets to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger grows in the ranges of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the discarded president Mohamed Morsi’s trial was opened, they went down to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial emphasizes this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
This is not a trial, it is a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial that raises a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to make Sisi judge, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Strikes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Police Academy in Cairo, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state has recognized homosexual marriages, “all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with,” the minister reminded in New York in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League of fighting anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Defense Secretary said he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The front of the nine states began with Texas who refuses to implement these benefits on the Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his rejection by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriages to approximately 5,600 people active, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and the retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard will take place on Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should group the best skators in the region.
Registrations are made on the site on Saturday morning from 9 p.m. and the qualification phases will begin in the afternoon, at 10 p.m., before the final scheduled at 15 p.m. and the award of the prizes at 16 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical skills of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young heroic prodige Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place this year for the Copenhagen European Championships and he doesn’t like anything so much as to return to competitors that overcome him with three heads.
Toronto Mayor Kills Journalists Who Come To Question About a Drug Case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media.
A video sent to the court seems to support these suspicions.
Interested, Rob Ford, has always denied to have consumed crack, while acknowledging having a tend for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled from his property several journalists who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rage detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced Thursday 31 October that a rage case had been detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France is free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The cat was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of anger was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"A epidemiological investigation has been launched in order to identify and take care of the people who could have entered in contact with this cat between October 8 and October 28 including," the Ministry of Health and Agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the cat have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
“In humans, the preventive treatment of human anger, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the appearance of symptoms, is very effective,” the statement said.
The ministries are now calling on people who had been bite, grabbed, scratched, or leaked on a mucosa or on a skin injured by this cat or whose animal had been in contact with this cat between 8 and 28 October to contact at 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
"French being free of anger since 2001, this cat or mother have been imported from another country, not free of charge," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last "autochtone" case of rage identified dates back to December 1998 on a wolf and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizooties (OIE)".
A case of rage on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
“Right is a fatal disease if it is not treated in time,” the ministries remind and it is transmitted for 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama to move back on health reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his ambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received warnings of resignation from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Barack Obama has adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have a health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said during a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a heaviness in the news” about the terminations, President Obama encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek a new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better suited health diets for the same price, or even for even cheaper than expected.
“You’re going to win,” he said.
The administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who contract their insurance themselves were forced to change the regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony before the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Mr. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch in October of the online market had failed “fortunately”.
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone else,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It is an exhausted Kathleen Sebelius who spoke this phrase, while she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her during yesterday’s assembly after a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican representative of Missouri, to find out if she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to insisting on Ms. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up the government-sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now praises to millions of Americans.
Vettel gets a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat to the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, the four-fold world champion of Formula 1, made a special helmet on Friday for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which was drawn by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his ecury.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel had to wear the helmet on Friday and Saturday at the trials.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his party from the suburbs
First of all, do not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Party of the Suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I am addressed to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
His project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his native municipality of Aubervilliers, was born of the will to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My first proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorial attached, today claims himself as "100% apolitical" although he has not always been neutral.
Militating in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the equality values I advocate in my program are linked to the left but if the right people are ready to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
There are only extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its program -consultable on the Internet- based on many topics supposed to be discussed to the residents of the suburbs and to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the building guard function...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be right, he acknowledges."
It is a problem of time and money.
The Parliament of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my nomination and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune has already seven list heads in Metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I have received since yesterday don’t all come from the suburbs,” he rejoiced.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedented, that U.S. spying “was gone too far in an inappropriate way.”
John Kerry said the US’s defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs was radicing, admitting, unprecedented, that on several occasions, spying “was gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, just like Barack Obama, ruled on a “automatic pilot” when a series of fire revelations of denounced Edward Snowden about NSA’s spy activities came up.
The flights have put the U.S. government at the heart of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: “It is undoubted that the President, me and other government members have learned of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on September 11.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying had crossed the boundaries, but insisted on the fact that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said, “In some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate way.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to the people that he was now undergoing a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse as part of this process.
Mr Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a good force and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to be jumped.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to respond to concerns regarding the alleged U.S. spy case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States, Senate subcommittee chairman on Thursday explained.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken before the European Parliament members and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had expressed regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration caused by the National Security Agency’s surveillance.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a democrat serving his first term, and president of the U.S. Senate’s subcommittee for European Affairs, said during an interview from Washington.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA captured millions of communications in Europe, which damaged relations with some U.S. allies, however the agency director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
Director of intelligence, James Clapper, justified the allies’ spying by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy said that his office was organizing a Congress trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participants should be revealed in the coming days.
He said the route remains to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to enable improving relationships, but also to show “affectional firmness.”
He explained that European leaders should be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs they have applied themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only in the world to do spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the anger generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, flooded by Shell's bad outcomes and the day after a Fed announcement of keeping its support to the economy in the state, as planned.
Australian woman appeals to prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for faultly claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to the trial and was released under caution.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 for false statements after told the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had attacked her early on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she was returning back to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police have interrogated Bamford for two days before it acknowledges that it has invented the story of all pieces.
She was detained in a cell of the local police office before the hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention center in the Phuket peripheral rather than in a women's prison.
It is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely worried” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“Of course, we’ve experienced an anxious moment, but we hope to bring her back home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the trial and was released after paying a 50,000 baht guarantee.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heightening of the penalty that could go to up to two years in jail and a prison in an adult prison.
However, after the recent Phuket murder of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand may also try to restore its deteriorated image from tourists, which could lead to a dismissal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who came differently than with the RSCA cars
French police have decided to set strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain scheduled on Tuesday, police zone spokeswoman Marie Verbeke said on Friday.
The Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this Champions League match will have to necessarily use the movement system established by the RSCA.
“The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border station to the PSG stadium,” the spokeswoman said.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to enable arrest and even guards to be arrested," Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff, to reflect on the ways to better integrate students who live on horses between multiple cultures.
The school commission has just revealed its vision of "Live Together in French".
The Vision Diversity organization has been walking for a year in schools to help students of all origins discover common signs that are not limited to the French language.
Discovering neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are signs.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are from the race or they have come from other places.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all that,” explains Vision Diversity chairman Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school committee.
“On the transmission, for example, of what is the Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we experience, within the student client,” he notes.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research center that will provide tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from other places.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“From different pedagogical strategies, that’s the real need,” she summarizes.
The research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
