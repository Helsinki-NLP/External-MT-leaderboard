Populist right wins in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early parliamentary elections in Austria have, according to the first approximate results, led to a considerable weakening of both parties in the current grand coalition and a marked strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP) has suffered heavy losses, with the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the Carinthian state government, Jörg Haider, is preparing for his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the rough results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
Peor has still finished the OVP losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
It is the worst result, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the war and especially for the popular ones who called these early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results speculation was made about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this Monday it could be reached at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path to the constant and most approximate starting point of the election results, that is, the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of both populist right parties - the Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 per cent and the BZO, eleven per cent of the vote - and the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing as in 1999 would happen again when the Populars negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it broke away from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction from the European Union.
This is clearly the case for Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is now assuming his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party also managed to get into parliament, although it lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent threshold and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles is not solved, it could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The minister said in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not resolved then yes, then yes we would certainly get to this cooling", he said after the meeting which was organised on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from prosecution and fined, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved", the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, the best thing would be, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest instances.
After that, he can request the exonération of the cause and wait in freedom for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"I advise appealing to the High Court and then pardon would be possible", said the Czech Foreign Minister.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is by getting the convict "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such support was already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have a strong interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this", Schwarzenberg commented.
Moreover, as the ČTK said, it insisted to its colleague that the Czech Republic considered the problem of Czech entomologists to be of great importance.
"We consider it a real mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists", he announced.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he received from the Indian side a promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received enough promises", he just stated.
A Czech referee in a seabed fight
I go to an electronic wall map, and it shows Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team working in the UN's Division for Ocean and Sea Law.
Its head, the head of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It's this spirit and enthusiasm for work that governs it.
The seabed still hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also organisms unknown to us today that in themselves hold the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the land
The countries with coastlines have today begun to fiercely dispute new undersea territories.
According to the UN Treaty, they are taking advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Border which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometres from the coast of a given country.
The Treaty gives it exclusive rights over all the resources of the Continental Shelf.
"Continental Border simply means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the edge of the sea coast, and often the 200-nautical-mile border, which is pure economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf must be accompanied by scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to organise a technical and legal specialist assistance commission.
The Commission has so far received five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have made progress", Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its maritime dominion.
However, New Zealand has also done so - the seabed area awarded by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in their study.
The profit that will come from using the seabed will be, as they promise, priceless.
Other states are also gradually submitting applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Treaty.
Where the Continental Shelf ends, the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty to be "the common heritage of mankind" begins.
Here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right to exploit these areas is governed by treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a goldmine", says Director Mikulka emphatically, adding that "its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract".
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors, as were a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It is authorised to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be explored by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it's like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, who according to legend revived the Golem.
During the hostage rescue, the German Special Forces Command was on the scene.
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are emerging about the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
So at the liberation site were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, Federal Police Aircraft Squadron, Federal Criminal Investigation Office and experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity institution.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted the help from Germany to use as support on the ground.
"Fortunately, that moment did not come", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, a group of travellers, consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian woman and their 8 Egyptian companions, had been kidnapped by assailants.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as details of their release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the rescued people arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of the release.
At first there was no information in Berlin about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and the special forces have to return in Airbus of the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package.
The first chamber of the United States Congress has narrowly failed a huge $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones has fallen very sharply.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected by 227 votes to 206 the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, he failed to reach a majority for a program that should limit financial market disorder.
With a dramatic action the desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the huge $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the Democratic negotiating director had asked the deputies to vote on the plan even though it's not as popular.
"It is difficult to get political approval to prevent something that has not yet happened", he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell by more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investors' concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts expect other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To put the program into effect, it must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The organizers record an increase in the number of bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakening economic situation, the desire of Germans to travel remains the same as before.
As the travel association of Germany (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, the number of reserves for the autumn months had already increased.
Thus the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The results are based on GfK figures which are the information analysed on bookings in 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakening dollar, travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of bookings increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organised trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices are rising, in this case travel costs are 'better calculable for the customer than during a solo trip'.
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months, the trips were well booked, so the sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the open-air parties at the endless Spa, the beer in one-litre jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She's blonde, the TV presenter and wears a custom Bavarian traditional costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: as soon as we are in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially because I am at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap traditional Bavarian costume seems to be fulfilling its function.
Actually as an Oktoberfest tourist from northern Germany my sense of well-being in traditional Bavarian clothes to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa, everything is not so bad.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian clothes or leather pants; none seem to be noticing or feeling unpleasant - it's all absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A doll draws my attention to my apron that I was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, the right side is virgin, the right side is engaged, behind is widow".
Oh, my God, I'm going to lock up behind on the left now.
"All right", he says, laughing.
The others don't mind many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear hats that say "To drink to get dressed!" and show off, uninvited, their naked ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistically is called Bob, from England and also a first-time Oktoberfest attendee.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he's put aside his pint glass of beer he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those famous people who can drink a lot.
The others are not so lucky and can't consume as much alcohol.
Around eight o'clock at night, the paramedic teams run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The paramedics appear in groups every time - suddenly there are always four people bringing the covered stays from one tent to the next.
That works like most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You can't tell who's suffering from the degrees of alcoholism and is in the swing.
"They are the ones who "can't take it anymore", a health worker answered my question and disappeared in a tumult.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the town of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released on bail since then.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, European powers were keen to penetrate the country's interior.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 paces inland into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, that's what the guides say.
The building is positioned at the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your compound is a little run down.
But once the box office was vaulted, there was no doubt whatever the greatness of the enterprise that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation consortium.
Germany, a latecomer in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that stretched to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has led to the fall of the
British rule and when the forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for the Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been decaying and has been left on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the Eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there's a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got on a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert on foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a journey of shaking, which produced the cadence of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has aroused some suspicion in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to make deals.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its internal relations.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It's not a case if it's not one way or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point", I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey", he replies, "does not want to face that choice".
He then underlines a point which almost everyone I have spoken to up to now had recited to me almost from memory: Turkey's relations with the Middle East, the Caucasus region and the entire Black Sea region are a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe as a whole can metaphorically build those railway lines that open up the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts return to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had witnessed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would you have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East were now largely in the hands of Turkey?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe".
So there is little doubt as to what the continent will be that this fascinating country must claim.
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (left, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were in our late 20s - we just refuse to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the choir's will and ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He'd say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's how you just sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never imposing, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical score was, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that never, by any, have I been disappointed  otherwise, I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two war horses very well known throughout the world".
We're going to miss him so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25), you state that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 won a Houblon-Norman research fellowship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate".
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
I was struck by their simplicity and the force they conveyed, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
Second round for Honda's best seller
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation Jazz.
If its predecessor already had ample seating, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
In addition, the car has a refined mechanical system that makes driving more comfortable and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
So this is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is aesthetically similar to the model that follows, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before we analyze the new model, we must note that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time frame than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since its release.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz cars, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a 17% growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz vehicles since 2002, representing 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary expects to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to largely alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand's managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share Honda is counting on the arrival of another new model.
The Insight is a five-door, compact hybrid - 4.37 metres long - of which the Japanese company expects to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By market and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once it is presented in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz grows at all its heights.
Its length is up to 12 feet [3.90 m], width up to 4 feet [1.69 m], and wheelbase up to 8 feet [2.50 m], an increase of two inches [5 cm].
The height, however, remains unchanged at 1.52 metres.
Along with the increased dimensions, the interior habitability also increases.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
The boot capacity - which has a double bottom system - is also increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the first-generation boot.
It should be noted that these measurements are for the version with the 1.4 engine, since the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior features such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the windscreen - are an improved access to the rear seats.
And the doors leading to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees in the first Jazz.
Also new are the engines in this second generation Jazz.
At the start of its commercialisation, this small model will have two petrol engines of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both engines incorporate i-VTEC technology which achieves lower fuel consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 litre engine achieves 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
The previous generation's 83 horsepower is now 100.
This 100 horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The Bee Car that Avoids Collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, specifically bees.
A Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technology Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general manager of PR for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of Nissan's four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand's vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most important are the bee's compound eyes, able to see at an angle of over 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterrupted within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser rangefinder.
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor, which immediately prevents the collision.
"The minute it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right angles or higher to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to spin its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to prevent the small robot from colliding.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It requires no storage of information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even mega".
This is the first step in developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Shake before you mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury Department, besides having plenty of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages at banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative browser game: 'Bad Credit Hotel.'
I mean, the Hotel of bad credit... or the Hotel of messes.
The grim aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, what's probably their goal.
It's true that you have useful information, but it's not very detailed.
It's more of a teen page than a general audience site.
What if the game is complete?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because buying a better house is not even a word...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay out nine billion dollars to acquire 21 percent of its capital, a news that has been met with a sharp drop in its stock market.
A week after discovering a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a price per unit of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the bonds as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible bonds, which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a unit price of $29 per unit, 28 per cent above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley shares were still down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status", explained John Mack, the American group's managing director.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new charter last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but he puts it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Their alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious behavior than before.
The terms of the deal, which was presented on Monday, also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: on Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
"A week ago", explained Toshihide Mizuno, the MUFG's chief executive, in Tokyo, "we thought the stake would have been made up of ordinary shares only.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise risks and cover ourselves. "
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One Solvency Ratio of close to 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan needed to ease his balance sheet a lot since late August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market share fall by half as the cost of security against a risk of default on its debt soared.
This cost was falling last Monday but was still at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is a joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished, with 64% of voters voting 'yes' to the referendum, according to official results which referred to 80% of the votes cast.
According to these results, the "no" won 28%, 7% of the votes were void and 0.7% were blank.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a count by a non-governmental organization announced a broad victory for the "yes" vote, estimating it at between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
"The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in complete calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft constitution implies the increase of the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign currency sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and has the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to implement in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 people kidnapped in Chad have been released
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
By morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked fine when they arrived at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately flown by helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since moved from one Zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, which organised the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces personnel, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest have fled", said the official who kept his name anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, spoke in Belgrade of the role played by Italian secret agents and special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the secret services, the special forces", he said without elaborating.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The Sudanese army said on the eve of the attack that it had intercepted an SUV carrying the kidnappers, killing six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
He also claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by the group.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture has made headlines and is taking up the current election campaign.
It's better this way.
But one area of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums being given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or starving national historic sites?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to restoring only the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in their Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people in 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies are concerned with researching history, preserving at little cost piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are the ones who are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and officials throw their bulldozers at our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The Dutch governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - the first in Europe - will help to nationalise the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is in difficulty as a result of the impact of the US mortgage crisis. The three countries will support the financial and insurance institution, which also has operations in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission's chief economic adviser.
Fortis Bank was the first to suffer the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis which has been occurring in several waves for over a year, and therefore the decisions taken in respect of the Bank can in some sense be considered precedent-setting.
According to the decision taken early Sunday, the three countries will buy about half (49 percent) of the Bank's property in their area.
The Bank will most likely sell part of its business, including mainly the activities - mainly insurance - bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amro.
Fortis' shares started a steep decline last week and by the second half of the week, there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow itself to go bust.
The company's shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Looking at current share prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management attributed the sharp drop in Fortis' shares to the uncertainties in the North American market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the stock showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian Government had previously assured investors that they had nothing to worry about, they would not lose their money.
The Bank's customers have not been in any panic, they have not invaded the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when looking at drug purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy experts fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programmes for the protection of personal data, which in all cases link the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in independent hands, or else "we leave the chicken coop to the fox", says Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program, as quoted by the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation depend on the health status of the customer and if they think the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before sending the client to a medical check-up and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer's identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the patient's illnesses and health status.
For example, if you regularly take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is practically incurably high, so you are immediately placed in a higher risk category.
There are many versions of the programme, some even setting a risk number, so the insurance company besides the administration has little to do, although there are some difficulties.
The disadvantages of the programme include the fact that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances are used both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former is not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not been fined for their negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also produced lab test results and combined them with drug use data to obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and healthcare providers.
The bill giving the authority the right to control companies specialised in the provision of personal data is already before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognises that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his programme, which will require specific consent from the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot refuse his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens are, after all, exposed to the fox's goodwill.
General menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutual trading partners, this issue, in addition to other largely global issues, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to discuss mainly cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have yet to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit which began yesterday in Marseilles.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and reached an agreement to double their trade to over 100 billion euros in five years.
This is not an overly ambitious objective, given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007.
The 26 existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonized, so that air transport can fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
Both sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism in all its forms and called for a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides bear a heavy responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, meaning that by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty per cent.
India is also in agreement with this, just as at the climate conference next year a global agreement should be reached and greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent food prices from rising and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive contracts worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be attending the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt international book exhibition is expected to attract more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries, covering 171,790 square meters of exhibition space, with more than 403,000 titles on display and Turkey as guest of honor.
The Italian government will be represented by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities, Francisco Maria Giro, at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the press will follow in Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse, where figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy will be presented.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing in total Italian production, particularly for adults and adolescents.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett the millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris has been found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the area of the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson has dispelled any remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have confirmation that it is the same one that Steve Fossett was flying over the day he disappeared", he said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has said that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The US Transportation Safety Board (TSB) has announced that a team of investigators has been sent to identify the aircraft, which was a Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal remains were found by a couple near his Mammoth Lakes home.
It's two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had earned a place in history through a long string of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete a round-the-world flight in a hot air balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, I had circumnavigated the globe by plane, nonstop.
Among his records, he also had the distinction of flying over the Andes at 15,445 meters, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
An off-the-charts SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and defined angles.
This is, in short, the last born among the "compact" SUVs of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
The launch of the Glk SUV, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th, will be unexpected and unconventional.
The advertising campaign accompanying the debut of the new car will launch a new form of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of the Milanese shopping mall, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will get the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
The new GLK will then be illuminated at different times in all its details, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, to be reconstituted into a single image.
Mercedes is certainly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will this formula catch the interest of future buyers?
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is being played.
But who are these 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group called 'Ultras Italia' which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, to tell the truth, has never caused too many problems.
And they'd never met the rival fans either.
The group extraction is on the right.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia has been added a small group (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Apulia.
They have three-color flags showing the militants' city of origin: Saturday night they were removed so they would not be identified.
They inspire the English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, the Levski's.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already checked them all: among those who had come out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied a ticket and also travel.
Now the interior ministry is waiting to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) which prevents people from attending not only Italian stadiums but also stadiums throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they'll never set foot in a stadium again.
By luck!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others will be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way", they say from the Ministry of the Interior.
"So, eyes wide open, especially in view of Wednesday's National League game in Lecce".
In Apulia there is also a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during the Mameli anthem?
This is the thought (expressed unhappily) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the post that was previously held by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste's public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behaviour of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist  adds the Observatory's n.1  the crimes are attributed to the countries in which the event takes place.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to the Mameli anthem: those too are not a crime, but if you allow them they are not educational either...".
