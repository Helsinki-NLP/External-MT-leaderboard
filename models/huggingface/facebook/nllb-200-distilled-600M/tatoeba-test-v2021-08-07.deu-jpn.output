The earthquake was a disaster the country had never experienced before.
The result was rather disappointing.

That's ironic.
That's not particularly polite.
This is not toothpaste, this is facial foam!
This isn't wine. It's just grape juice.

This is my return ticket.
This is my little brother Tom.
That's my favorite song.

This is my desk.
That's my line!
This is my dictionary.
I don't care much about that.
That's not my sister, that's my mother.
It's not serious.
This isn't Tom's suitcase.
This is difficult.
That's weird.

This is Tom's cup.
This is surprising.
This is our baseball field.
This is our friend Tom.
This is our house.
This is totally impossible.
That's what she said.
That's really nice of you.
Kai's made of concrete, and it collapsed in several places.
The rabbit asked whimperingly:Will you eat me? To which the fox replied:Why should I? I am a vegetarian.
I can't do that.

This can't be Mary.
The kitty didn't come down from the tree.
The child looked his father in the eye with reverence.
The child has cleaned his toys himself.

The child fell asleep.
The child fell asleep.
The child fell asleep at once.

The song was a big hit.
The girl I liked to suffer as a student was in love with Tom.
The girl urged to be taken to the zoo.
The girl is afraid of dogs.
The girl let the bird go.
The girl has a clear voice.
The girl is small for his age.
The girl likes music.
The girl with the long hair is Maria.
The girl with the long hair is Maria.
The girl wore a long scarf around her neck.
The girl I told you about lives in Kyoto.
I like that about you, Tom.
The human brain weighs about 1.4 kg.
The red roof over there is Tom's house.
I'm so sorry about yesterday.
I'd like to try that.

The problem is that you're too young.
The problem is that you're too young.
The problem is that your car won't be available on that day.
The problem is, we don't have the money.
The problem is almost done.
The problem is that the child has been overly harassed.
The problem naturally provoked discussions.
The problem became acute again.
I've had enough of this!
The race was rigged.
Restaurant is on the ground floor.
The risk is too great.
I think that's interesting!
The ship had hoisted the American flag.
The ship was speeding before a strong wind.
The ship is sinking.
The ship left the harbour and was never seen again.
The phone was more expensive than I thought.

You can say that.
You can speak German.
You can count on him.

You can take some time off today.
You can borrow my car anytime.
You can't imagine it, can you?
You can't do it right.

You can't swim here.
You can't bribe that judge.
You don't speak German, do you?
You can suck me.
You can do whatever you want with your time.
You don't speak French very well, do you?
You can't expect me to think of everything!
You can talk to me openly.
You can eat as much as you want.
You can go anywhere.
You might be right.
You just run away from the problems of life.
You'd better back up now.
You're lying!
You always ruin everything.
You make me happy.
You like snow, don't you?
You're putting too much emphasis on this event.
You must listen to the teacher.
You must take the 8:15 train to Paris.
You must hurry.
You must take care of the child.
You must overcome the fear of the dark.
You must finish this work before the deadline.
You must think of some excuse.
You must work hard.
You must keep your room in order.
You must learn English every day.
You must be hungry now.
You're going to bed!
You must do as you are told.
You need to gather more information.
You must learn more.
You must learn with all your energy.
You must stop gambling.
You don't have to go there.
You must learn much more diligently.
You must be back before 9:00.
You must be back before 10:00.
You tend to let things go.
You tend to forget things.

Through my life I contribute to nothing but global warming.Don't say anything vague! You make me happy, Tom. Do you think that matters?
"You talk too much". he said.
Can I see your license?
Can I take this bag on the plane?
Can I try it?
Can I see this?
Can I ask you your name?
Can I ask you your name and address?
You say you wrote this book?
You'd better tell him the truth!
You keep saying you're busy, and lately we haven't been able to see each other.
You said you wanted to make new friends.

You'd better tell him the truth.
Tom, are you really with Maria?
You're hiding something!
You don't understand why I've been worried.
You still trust him after he broke his promise twice?
You'd be a good teacher.
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
You'll be shocked to hear this.
You'll feel better.
You're gonna have to let all this noise go right or wrong.
Sooner or later, you'll understand.

There's a ghost in the house.
You can't say that.
There's nothing interesting in the paper.
I'm not bothered.
I had to teach my uncle.
I'm sorry, but this sentence sounds translated.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
I'm sorry I misunderstood you!
I'm sorry I got you in trouble!
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
I'm sorry to call you so late, but I really wanted to hear your voice.
I'm sorry I ruined your plans.
I'm sorry I opened your mail wrong.
I'm sorry, I just had to laugh like crazy!
I'm sorry, you're paying for the overweight.
I'm very sorry that I made that mistake.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.

It was a pretty ordinary party.
It was easier than I thought.
It was a lovely fall evening.
It was such a cold day that nobody was on the street.
They were all so fast, I couldn't catch up.
There were about a thousand people there.
It would be nice if it was cleared up tomorrow.
It would certainly not be too difficult to find out who has infiltrated our system.

It was a pure coincidence that I found it.
It was Saturday night.
It was awfully cold yesterday.

It was very thoughtful of you to cool the wine.
It was very cold this morning.
It was his bike that was stolen.
Socrates laid the foundations of logic.
It was foolish of Tom to lend Mary money.
Tom was unconscious to call Mary after midnight.
It was really funny that everyone believed my story.
It was time for a change.
It was largely his own fault.
It was mostly his own fault.

You haven't answered my questions lately.
I've been getting a lot of cramps lately when I'm sleeping.
I've been so crazy lately about yogurt and orange jam.
I've been eating only onigiri with tuna and mayo lately.
I feel like there's been very little interesting series lately.
I haven't seen him much lately.
I've been getting used to his way of talking lately.
Recently, meat is very expensive.
I've been enjoying painting lately.
I've been sleeping like this lately, from 1:00 or 2:00 until 9:00.
Tom no longer translates my sentences lately. Does he not like me anymore?

Turn it off.
Turn off the light, please.
Do what the doctor said.
Make your bed.
Make the TV louder.
Don't make fun of children.
Make the kitchen clean.
Don't open the door.
Close the door when you're sitting on the pot!
Don't worry, life is still ahead of you.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Don't worry about it!
️Don't get your hopes up!
Do I have to stay the night or do I have to leave it alone?
Please close the door.
Let's make a little puppy!
Let's just call it a day.
Let's do it again!
Do it on Monday.
Do it as I told you.
Do it when you have time.
Don't do anything stupid.
Make room for the luggage!
Make room for the package!
Are you worried about Tom?
Don't you worry about Tom at all?
Don't make trouble for Tom!
Close or you'll be late!

Sometimes I find it hard to speak French.
Sometimes it's important to not insist on your opinion, but to listen to others' opinions.
Sometimes I can't help but feel.
Sometimes we have to take a step back and think.
Sometimes I salt it a little bit.
Sometimes even a devil sheds tears.
Sometimes I get sad.
You can't trust him.

I couldn't remember the title of the song.

Nothing is more regrettable than losing in the final.
Nothing is as precious as love.
Nothing is as difficult as something difficult to explain.
Nothing is as important as friendship.
Nothing can stop her from marrying him.
Nothing gives me more fun than talking to Tom.
Nothing gives me more fun than talking to Tom.

Now calm down!
Well, it's time.Let's finish the class.
Well, the night is very long, isn't it?
Let's get started on the game.
Don't be so downset now! Eat something delicious, and you'll be better off soon!
Only thing that's clear is, we're just friends.
Only by knowledge can we as a nation face the dangers that threaten our society.
I'm the only one left.
Very few die of fever.
Takeuchi was the only one who didn't accept the invitation.
Just because it was written by a native speaker, a text doesn't have to be good.
Just because someone made a little mistake, you can't just whine about it.
Few know about the plan.
Few know about the plan.
Few know how much one needs to know to know how little one knows.

Tom put the butter in the fridge?
Do you think Tom really went to school today?
Tom still remembers me?
Tom can write love letters in French?
Although the accident happened six months ago, my neck still hurts.
Although the train was delayed, we still managed to make it on time.
Although he lives next door, he doesn't even say hello.
He came to work even though he was sick.
Though he is rich, Tom has hardly any friends.

Though it was very late, he continued to work.
Although I went through all the rain to meet her, she wasn't there.
Although I don't have any money, I already bought a book.
Although she was so sick and she had such a headache, she only had to sleep one night and she was already recovering.
Do you think there's snow coming?
Do you think there's snow coming?
Though she has flaws, I like her.
Although she can sing well, Maria rarely gets the chance to show it.
I hate him.
Frankly, his speeches are always boring.
Obviously, that's the most important point.
Open your heart and tell me everything.
Open your heart.
️Please open your eyes.
There's a butterfly!
Oh, thank you!
Oh, you're still awake?
Oh, it's raining! What am I gonna do now? I just hung the laundry.
Tom can't read without glasses.
Without your help, it would have been impossible.
Without your help, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish this job on time.
I would have been here earlier without the storm.

Without her help, I wouldn't have made it.



Without me, you'd be nothing.
I couldn't live without music.


Without Tom's help, I would have failed.

Oh, look at that!
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Oh, what a freak I was!
I've gained two pounds!
O little snail, just climb up to Mount Fuji!
Nikujaga made me.

I've been keeping a diary for three years now.
Johanna has been quiet and in a bad mood for a few days.

Chrome seems to be kind of slow since I installed the new version.
I've been having a headache since last night and I'm feeling bad.
You've been crazy and excited since the beginning. Can't you just wait a little bit and calm down?
How long has she been ill?
Be home at 9:00 at the latest.
Be quiet while he's playing the piano.
Even that don't you understand?
Even her mother tongue doesn't speak it perfectly.
Of course you are!
Even if it rains, I'll be leaving tomorrow.
Even if we don't get lucky on the first try, we can just keep fucking until I get pregnant.

Get back to the table.

Together they built a snowman.
She applied for a visa.
They went to the mosque to pray.
They went to the mosque to pray.
She began to understand.
They began with violent attacks on the enemy.
She greeted me with a smile.
She decided to thaw the meat in the microwave.
She decided to undergo surgery.
She always complains about how bad her health is.
She's always complaining about this or that.
She's always complaining about this or that.
They consider him their leader.
She bit him.
She flipped through the magazine.
She looked away from the window.
You broke the silence.
She taught him how to play the piano.
She bowed and picked up the coin.
She bowed and picked up a pebble.
She's always thinking about making money.
I gather fresh herbs in the spring field, while the snow falls down on my sleeve.
She expressed her gratitude to all who supported her.
They wandered the desert looking for a buried treasure.

She willingly granted my request.
They accomplished their mission.
She encouraged him to write a novel.
She endured her grief without shedding a single tear.
She tells everyone she meets her unhappy life story.
They eat apples.
She folded her towel properly.
She liked to sell old clothes at high prices in flea markets, and eventually opened a secondhand store.
She's just starting to play the piano.
She's just starting to play the piano.
She's been dyeing her hair black for years.
She fell and immediately broke out in tears.
You caught foxes with a trap.
She started writing the report at 8:00 and finished it at 12:00.
She begged him to stay.
They're leaving tomorrow.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
She demands the impossible.
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
She's happy about her new dress.
They drove to the coast.

She took a taxi to the hospital.
She went to Paris for the first time.
They were afraid of being listened to.
She gave him a present.
She gave me a sign not to say anything.
She pretended to be innocent.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

When she was kissed, she panicked.
She fell in love with him.
She doesn't admit she's wrong.
She went to university to study English.
She went to her room to change.
She walked and talked.
They believe that the soul is immortal.
She was burning with anger.
She greeted me with a good morning.
You called.
You left the room very quietly.
You lost the battle.

Maybe I'm happiest when I play guitar.
Maybe I'll stay here until Monday.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this has nothing to do with our problem.
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
Maybe the new boss is a little more tolerant than the old one.
Maybe he's not happy.
Maybe he'll be here today.
Maybe I don't like the women at all, just their voices.
Maybe it was me who was too under-informed. I'll take back the sentence above where I wronged Ayumi.
Maybe Laura was sick.
Have fun at the concert!
40 people came.
Pugles have sharp eyes.

From the plane, small hills look like flat land.
I'm broken from running.
Of all the pears I've ever eaten, this is the most delicious.
Of all bodies with equal surface area, the one with the greatest space content is the ball.
I'd like to be examined by the doctor.

When a woman masturbates, hormones are released that increase femininity.

When a girl cries, I don't know what to say.

If God didn't exist, they'd have to invent him.
When I get to the station, I'll call you right away.
When I think of my son, I get a headache.
When I think about what I've done, I feel pathetic.
If I'd noticed the problem, I'd have told you.
When I do that, they laugh at me.
If I want to see the blue sky, I go up on the roof.
When I write the letter, I throw it in the mailbox.
If I wanted to scare you, I'd tell you what I dreamed a few weeks ago.
When I hear this tune, I have to think of my time in school.
When I hear this song, I think of you and miss you.
If I could send you a marshmallow, Trang, I would.
If I were you, I'd do the same.
If I were you, I'd go home right now.
If I were you, I'd try to go to another hospital.
When I go shopping, I always end up buying too much.
Had I noticed, I would have told you.
Had I noticed, I would have told you.
If I don't forget, I'll tell him.
If I had enough money, I would have bought the book.
If I'd known I was gonna get photographed, I'd have worn something better.
When I grow up, I'll marry Tom.
When I grow up, I wanna be a firefighter.
If I had more money, I'd have bought the pencil.
Sakura
If I remember correctly, they're cousins.
If only I didn't have to take the English test.
If I knew his address, I'd write him.
If I could be like that...
